Birmingham and Selma have become synonymous with the expansion of civil rights they helped forge; that history is in eternal tension with the drive to shrink this progress back to the oligarchic dark ages of the 1901 state constitution.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Huntsvillians used to lament that the state line wasn't drawn some 20 miles south at the Tennessee River, but now they elect politicians very much in step with Alabama values. In March, their congressman, Mo Brooks, read from <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/26/gop-congressman-quotes-hitlers-mein-kampf-slam-trumps-adversaries-liars/?utm_term=.1157b4c8929c"" target=""_blank"">""Mein Kampf"" on the House floor</a> (to be fair, he was comparing Democrats to Hitler) the same week that local scholars were hosting a symposium on NASA in the South. And the area's two state senators, one a former Democrat, were among the 25 white Republican men who made abortion a crime this week, with no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To read the names and places of those 25 white men is to enter some alt-right Disneyland of American history. There is Steve Livingston of Scottsboro, namesake town of the nine black ""Scottsboro Boys,"" who earned international fame as victims of judicial lynching after being falsely accused of rape by two white women (from Huntsville). There's the state senate's President Pro Tem Del Marsh of Anniston, scene of the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/frri/planyourvisit/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">1961 Klan firebombing</a> of the Freedom Riders; 50 years later he made civil rights history himself as a cheerleader for the 2011 anti-immigrant law that recast <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/no-sweet-home-alabama.html"" target=""_blank"">Jim Crow as Juan Crow</a>.

But given that the majority of <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/who-is-most-affected-by-alabamas-new-abortion-ban.html"" target=""_blank"">pregnancies terminated in Alabama</a> are by women of color, it may seem counterintuitive that today's Constitution-defying legislators are so keen on protecting the ""rights"" of future human life that will very likely be dehumanized by the civil society those same white men created: substandard schools from which children are pipelined to <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/judge-rules-alabama-prisons-fail-to-adequately-prevent-suicides.html"" target=""_blank"">suicide-inducing prisons</a>; <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2017/12/un_poverty_official_touring_al.html"" target=""_blank"">sewage-plagued communities</a> shocking to UN poverty specialists and only miles from Selma, starting place of the famous 1965 march pivotal to the passage Voting Rights Act, which was <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/shelby-county-v-holder"" target=""_blank"">undermined in 2013</a> by a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding a challenge out of Alabama.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the yin and yang of Alabama, ""civil rights"" are its biggest curse and its greatest gift. In 2018, the state saw its biggest increase in tourism ever, according to Alabama's tourism director Lee Sentell.

Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin confirmed to me today that the abortion ban affected two IT companies considering moves to the city -- one canceled outright, while the other ""put the brakes on negotiations.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But boycotts in response to this abortion law are more likely to punish the state's brave, embattled progressives than shame those who are without shame.<a href=""http://repdaniels.com/representative-anthony-daniels/"" target=""_blank""> Anthony Daniels</a> (D-Huntsville), the educator-turned-House minority leader who led the walkout of Democratic legislators in protest of the abortion-crime bill, proposes a constructive alternative.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're the guinea pigs for bad pieces of legislation,"" he told me of his Republican-super-majority state.

It was Daniels who introduced the ""rape and incest"" amendment that made the ban's supporters cast a hard vote to force women to bear the children of rapists and/or relatives. And by spotlighting that bill's <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/alabama-abortion-ban-was-deeply-unpopular-in-2018-previously-unreleased-polling-shows.html"" target=""_blank"">unpopular extremes</a> -- including the 99-year sentences for abortion doctors -- rather than getting into the merits of the abortion debate, he was able both ""to divide their base and to satisfy our base by giving them something to grab hold of.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even if the ""Alabama Human Life Protection Act"" doesn't end up being <a href=""https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/5/15/18624810/alabama-abortion-ban-supreme-court-exceptions-senate"" target=""_blank"">the test case</a> that gets the Supreme Court to rule up or down on Roe, Alabama has lived up to its legacy by forcing a stark moral reckoning. Just as the <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx"" target=""_blank"">widely accepted ""rape and incest""</a> exception shows that abortion is not always murder in the eyes of its opponents, so does the <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/15/alabama-abortion-law-american-views-abortion-poll-pro-life-pro-choice-republicans-catholic-heartbeat/3678315002/"" target=""_blank"">latest polling suggest</a> that supporters do not take an absolutist either/or position.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Perhaps proponents could concede that there is a moral argument against abortion. For one thing, there just is. And for another, acknowledging someone's aggrievement is a proven conflict de-escalator, as when<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628492/"" target=""_blank""> doctors apologize to victims</a> for medical errors and are consequently less likely to be hit with malpractice suits. And only from the safe distance of high ground, one might then be able to point out that ""being pro-birth is not the same as being pro-life,"" as Daniels puts it, or consistent with being pro-death penalty and against birth control access, Medicaid, children's insurance and the rest of Alabama conservatives' pet peeves.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every liberal here knows that the game is a long one. Back in 1976, the legendary liberal federal judge Frank Johnson -- a Republican -- took <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/us/us-relinquishes-alabama-prisons.html"" target=""_blank"">receivership of the state's prison system</a>, writing that it beggared ""any current judicial definition of cruel and usual punishment.""

""The worst symptoms obviously were hallucinations. And I wasn't always oriented to time and place.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once, Palma locked herself out of her own house and another time, her bank account.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was no longer able to process the fact that a key opens the door. The computer screen looked completely different -- it was almost foreign,"" said the now-42 year old. ""What I was perceiving was different and so how I was responding was different -- if someone was asking for a pen, I would give them, for example, a key.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sometimes she had blissful, symptom-free days. With no warning, the dropping things, the hallucinations, the disorientation would return. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Brain lesion discovered on a scan </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After January, her symptoms ""progressed pretty quickly,"" she said, guesstimating she visited the emergency room at least 10 times. ""But as soon as they ruled out a brain bleed, I was discharged. Although I was a danger to myself and probably to others, they still discharged me,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She understands why, since no one could identify what was happening with her. ""They said, 'If you're not actually having a brain bleed, then it's not actually an emergency,' "" she said.  A seizure disorder was also investigated and quickly dismissed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On a brain scan, Palma's primary care physician detected a small lesion in the left frontal lobe of her brain and immediately sent her to <a href=""https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jonathan-j-rasouli"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Jonathan Rasouli, </a>chief resident of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, and his colleagues.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We decided it would probably be in her best interest to do a biopsy of this lesion,"" said Rasouli based on the fact that she was healthy and young and was having symptoms that he could directly correlate to the location of the lesion. Besides, she had no risk factors for anything else that might explain the presence of a brain lesion. Rasouli carefully explained the possibilities to his patient.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was told that it was most likely a malignant tumor which would require radiation and chemo even after the surgery,"" said Palma. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The surgery would be risky because the location of her ""tumor"" was very close to the brain region that controls speech.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli told CNN, ""Her fiancé had just proposed to her and they were looking to move in together and then all of a sudden she had this diagnosis of a brain tumor. Can you imagine?"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palma, though, believed the risk was worth it, ""given that it was supposed to be a malignant tumor. I still think the risk was worth it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her first operation, essentially a ""planning surgery,"" explained Rasouli, took place on September 2, 2018. A second surgery to remove the suspected tumor followed on September 12. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We did a small dissection of the brain tissue and what we saw was a very well encapsulated, firm lesion that was ovoid,"" said Rasouli. ""It looked like a quail egg: Same size, same look, same firmness.""<strong> </strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Wait a second, this is clearly not a brain tumor,"" he recalled saying at the time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked what a brain tumor looks like, he laughed: ""It doesn't look like a quail egg. Most brain tumors are very soft, very mushy, they're not very well defined, they're infiltrative and it's difficult to get completely around them.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Quickly, Rasouli took the extracted lesion away from the surgical field, placed it under a surgical microscope and opened it up.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""And what came out was a baby tapeworm,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How did it get there?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cysticercosis/disease.html"" target=""_blank"">Neurocysticercosis </a>is the medical term for when a baby pork tapeworm makes its way to the brain, said Rasouli. ""If you live in the US, it's almost impossible to get this.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those most at risk are those who travel to countries where this pork tapeworm is endemic and eat contaminated food -- usually raw fruits, raw vegetables or uncooked pork. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli said that the tapeworm found in her brain ""is not super-duper rare, it's just pretty uncommon. Maybe once every two years you'd see something like this, if even that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's absolutely no explanation as to how I contracted it,"" said Palma. She's never traveled outside the country and she doesn't eat raw foods or raw meat, at least not intentionally, she said. How long it had been lodged in her brain is another mystery, she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're still really scratching our heads about how she developed this,"" said Rasouli. ""If we had any suspicion that she could have been exposed to pork tapeworm or we thought this was potentially a parasite, we ideally would have treated her with antibiotics rather than taking her into surgery.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, Palma has no symptoms and is feeling fine. She's thankful to Rasouli and the medical staff at Mount Sinai for saving her life. If the tapeworm hadn't been removed (or destroyed with antibiotics), it could have caused a stroke or even death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With all the attention -- ""for some reason my story is fascinating to people"" -- Palma now has an important message to deliver: ""This is not something that is cause for widespread panic. What happened to me is extremely rare -- it's not the norm -- for someone who has not been overseas to contract this.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With a lot of people coming to her for medical advice, she gives the only advice she can: ""If you have symptoms that you cannot explain or are concerning to you, then please see a doctor. And see a good doctor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Not every headache turns out to be a parasite.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

They fear the regulatory uncertainty that could come from years of litigation, especially if it resulted in two different sets of emission rules for different parts of the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The question of the right level of regulation is complex,"" the industry said in the letter to Trump. ""What works best for consumers, communities, and the millions of US employees that work in the auto industry is one national standard that is practical, achievable, and consistent across the 50 states."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The letter said the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation would be as ""untenable"" as the tougher rules. The automakers also said they need regulatory certainty in order to make needed investment in the next generation of vehicles.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But California has fought to keep the tougher rules in place for itself and 12 other states that follow its lead. Those 13 states include about a third of the nation's population.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">California and the federal government are already fighting in court over the emissions rules and whether or not California will be able to maintain the tougher standards.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The automakers also sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday asking for a compromise with federal regulators. That letter said the automakers believe the best deal would be one that ""includes annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions midway between the existing standards and the preferred path outlined in the recent Environmental Protection Agency proposal."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">California has so far shown no interest in backing off its tougher standards. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A rollback of auto emissions standards is bad for the climate and bad for the economy,"" Newsom said in a statement about the industry's two letters. ""We should keep working towards one national standard -- one that doesn't backtrack on the progress states like California have made. California will continue to lead the coalition to block these rule changes from taking effect.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">White House spokesman Judd Deere said the blame for the lack of a single national standard rests not with the federal government but with California's refusal to negotiate with Trump administration to reach a compromise.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Deere also said the California Air Resources Board, the environmental regulator there, ""failed to put forward a productive alternative, and we are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Obama rules would have required automakers to produce vehicles with an average fuel economy to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2011/07/28/autos/fuel_economy/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">54.5 miles per gallon</a> by 2025 model year vehicles. The rules in place at that time would have only required an average of 34.1 mpg by that time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration moved to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/03/15/autos/relaxed-mpg-standards-consumer-impact/index.html"" target=""_blank"">reexamine</a> those tougher rules shortly after taking office.

An ""elliptical cluster"" of seismic activity had formed around the volcano, they determined, with seismic events taking place more than three miles beneath the surface. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""These seismic properties may indicate the presence of magma intrusions with a high content of [...] fluids, which may justify changing the current status of this volcano from 'extinct' to 'active,'"" the researchers wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moreover, they observed that the cluster of seismic events connected the volcano with the Tolud zone, to the south of the volcano, a region believed to store magma in the Earth's lower crust. The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said. Ash released by the eruption could spread beyond Russia, disrupting air travel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unfortunately, the volcano is difficult to monitor, thanks to its distance from permanent seismic stations, Koulakov said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We need to deploy more stations to understand if it's dangerous or not,"" he said.

I was married to my best friend and we had two beautiful, healthy and hilarious children, with successful careers and a beautiful home.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">My life would change forever after a simple Google search in November 2016. I had just seen Kate McKinnon perform the song ""Hallelujah"" on SNL and discovered that she's a lesbian. That shocked me because she didn't fit the awful stereotype often depicted in the media. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I quickly declared her my ""new girl crush."" But it was more than that. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At that moment, I realized that I wanted a relationship with a woman like her -- but I felt terrible for even having this thought, as someone who was faithfully married. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was slowly becoming clear to me that I was not straight. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How could I not know? I had my first ""boyfriend"" in the 3rd grade. I had already decided I was straight. How do you go back on that after being with guys for 20+ years? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Where I fell on the sexuality spectrum would take me the better part of two years to figure out. A part of myself wasn't living. And by not letting that part live, I was slowly dying. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Unraveling a life</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There's a price of admission for coming out as gay later in life. Over the course of several months, I paid the price daily. It was like I was watching a movie about myself but unable to control what was unfolding. Everything fell apart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I did my best to slowly confide in my husband. But I kept many of my feelings inside to avoid hurting him. He tried to be supportive, but he also needed answers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He felt unsettled and scared about the uncertainty of our future. He asked several times if I was a lesbian. It was a question that felt impossible to answer because I knew what that answer would mean. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I kept waiting for the moment where I would realize I was no longer gay so I could put a halt to everything. My family was being shattered and I couldn't stop it. I constantly had to remind myself, <em>""You get one life. This is your life and no one else's.""  </em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I felt alone. I was crumbling and desperately looking for someone who could relate. I Googled to the ends of the earth looking for stories like mine. They were few and far between -- and none seemed to touch on just how difficult the journey ahead of me could be.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By early 2018, my husband and I separated in an effort to give me some perspective. I lost time with my children as we began a shared custody schedule. I was consumed by the pit in my stomach --  the shame of ending my marriage because I was gay was like lugging a sandbag over my shoulders and having a rock in my stomach at the same time. I couldn't eat. My weight dropped by the day. For the first time since I met my husband, we went a full day without speaking. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I wasn't sure how to tell my conservative, Georgia-born and bred parents that their former pageant queen daughter was ending her marriage because she is gay. I'm very close with my parents -- a phone call with my mom is almost a daily occurrence. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I confided in my sister first. I wasn't brave enough to actually say the words -- the label of being gay or a lesbian was too much for my soul to bear at the time -- so I sent her a text message, ""I am not straight."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She responded perfectly, asking if she could buy a Pride flag and offered to tell my parents. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later that day, I got two of the most relieving texts from my parents that I've ever received. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I didn't realize until then how important it was to be accepted by my parents. I'm a grown woman, fully independent of my mom and dad -- but I still needed their love and acceptance. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Living my truth</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Telling my family wasn't the end of my journey. I was finally figuring out who I was. Now I was ashamed by that answer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That began to subside when I met other women in various stages of the coming out process, all on the same path. Hearing the experience of others felt like hearing my own: married to wonderful men, mothers of amazing kids, the perfect life practically every woman strives for. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through this group, led by a therapist, we quickly determined we are in this together. We were on a path that feels impossible to navigate until one day, you can live your truth and be perfectly fine shaping a new life. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's what I'm striving to do now: shape a new life that includes my now ex-husband and my kids. Our family structure just looks a little different than it used to. We spend most holidays together, attend parent-teacher conferences, we even have plans to take the kids to Disney World in the fall. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We no longer have the perfect suburban home together, but we are both navigating new relationships and have found people who understand the importance of us both being present for our children. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On New Year's Day this year, I came out on social media. I expected to see my friend list tick down but instead I was met by love and support. So many people choose to keep their private lives private, which I absolutely understand and respect. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But what so many don't realize is that sharing your tough moments can make other people's tough moments a little easier.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I don't think I would have been able to accept who I am as quickly as I did without the changes in American society in recent years. When I was growing up in the 1980s, someone's sexuality was only spoken about in hushed voices, as if the person had a disease they didn't want others to know about. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg -- who, like me, is in his late 30s and, like me, came out publicly just a few years ago -- <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kind-war-buttigieg-describes-struggle-sexual-orientation-emotional-speech-n991871"" target=""_blank"">put it this way</a>: ""It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would've swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is so much truth in his statement. There was such a big part of me that did not want to be gay. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a gay person over the age of 30 who hasn't felt this way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the flip side, it is getting better for younger generations. When I told my kids last year that if mom remarries, it will be to a woman -- it didn't faze them in the least.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Throughout all of this, I would have loved to have known that I was going to come out on the other side and be OK. And I want people reading my story to know that it's OK to be the person you're meant to be -- no matter what your age is when you finally get to know yourself and love who you are in the process. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Speaking to the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/06e0242a-681d-11e9-b809-6f0d2f5705f6"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times</a> about a decision not to collaborate with Supreme, Birkenstock's chief sales officer, Klaus Baumann, pointed out the reality of creating the appearance of demand: ""If I put a bouncer outside our doors on Saturday and regulate letting people in, I too could have a queue outside."" </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But it's not just about getting people to queue. There's the art of getting people excited about the experience. Like Supreme's loyal consumers, today's Yeezy buyers weren't put out to be standing outside on a rainy London morning. In fact, I'd bet there were probably fewer sighs, groans and eye rolls in these queues than any other in Britain. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">And it all tracks back to that culture of exclusivity. The level of anticipation isn't just about buying the shoes, but also about being one of the few people who gets to buy these shoes first. There's the thrill of ownership where others are forced to concede defeat; the aggregation of clout through consumerism. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">On top of that, streetwear sites like Hypebeast (where I formerly served as UK editor) and Highsnobiety, whose monthly user base is in the tens of millions often send professional photographers to shoot the scene. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In this sense, it's not just about securing the prize. It's about the act of being there and, perhaps more importantly, being seen to be there and letting your peers now that you got what they couldn't. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Whether they're ever worn or not, whether they're immediately resold to the highest bidder for a huge profit, you were there because you were part of something important, an event within the culture, and that's the prize no one can sell on. </div>]"

For men, it's 59.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most common type of anal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, originates in the cells lining the anal canal, according to the US National Library of Medicine. Typically, anal cancer spreads slowly and, if caught early, is often curable.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nationally, there are more than <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/race.htm"" target=""_blank"">6,500</a> new HPV-associated anal cancer diagnoses each year -- including about 4,300 in women and 2,200 in men, according to one agency estimate based on data from 2011 to 2015. That comes out to roughly a couple of cases for every 100,000 people.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>About the virus</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are 150 types of HPV, but most are rare and only 14 are considered high-risk for cancer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Most people -- about nine in 10 -- will get an HPV infection at some point in their lives,"" the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">says</a>. It's the most common sexually transmitted infection in the country, can be spread even when someone has no symptoms, and may result in symptoms years after being exposed to the virus.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">HPV infections mostly go away on their own, but some remain and can cause cervix, vagina and vulva cancer in women; penile cancer in men; and genital warts, anal cancer and head and neck cancers in both sexes. HPV-associated cancers are more likely to occur in the throat and cervix than the anus. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Other risk factors for anal cancer include HIV, smoking, and any medications or conditions that might weaken the immune system.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most likely type of HPV implicated in anal cancer is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805865/#bib1"" target=""_blank"">HPV 16</a>, which is covered by current vaccination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Current CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">recommendations</a> call for HPV vaccination for boys and girls to begin between the ages of 11 and 12, though the regimen can occur as early as age 9. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>When it comes to screening, the jury's out</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the HPV vaccine and routine screening have made cervical cancer ""one of the most preventable cancers,"" as the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">says</a>, the jury's still out on who should be screened for anal cancer, when and how.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Anal cancers are sometimes found through rectal exams -- part of a routine pelvic exam by a gynecologist, in Cross' case. These cancers may cause symptoms like pain or bleeding, but they often don't in earlier stages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was so not thinking anything was wrong because I didn't have any symptoms, and she gave me an exam and came around and said, 'Well, I just want you to know, whatever it is, it's curable,' "" Cross said. ""It was like 'What? What are you talking about?' ""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The American Cancer Society says that certain groups at higher risk -- like recipients of an organ transplant and men who have sex with men -- might benefit from a screening measure like the ""anal pap,"" which looks for precancerous cellular changes when the anus is swabbed.

Chris Stewart was sitting in church in Atlanta on an April Sunday in 2015 when he received a Facebook message with a news article and a plea from a friend. A police officer had killed her cousin, Walter Scott, and she needed help.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Later that day, his phone rang in the middle of an engagement photo shoot with his fiancée. This time it was Walter Scott's brother.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">""They're lying about my brother,"" Stewart recalled him saying. ""If you can get here by tomorrow, you're hired."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart, 40, is among a growing group of prominent civil rights attorneys in the country who have become the go-to for families of black men who have been killed by police. They are confidants and counselors, helping their clients navigate not just their cases, but the media and the public during one of the worst times of their lives.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Generations ago, civil rights attorneys fought against segregation, and to secure rights denied to African Americans, Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The current battle is staying alive to use those rights,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart did take the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/08/us/south-carolina-who-was-walter-scott/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Walter Scott</a> case, and would end up using a tactic that turned Scott's death into a national rallying cry against excessive force by police. Before Stewart, there was Benjamin Crump, who helped tell the world about <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/18/justice/florida-teen-shooting-details/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trayvon Martin</a>, a teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and S. Lee Merritt, who helped bring attention to the death of <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/us/jordan-edwards-shooting-trnd/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Edwards</a>, a teenager shot and killed by a suburban Dallas police officer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a series of interviews, the attorneys spoke to CNN about their work, their motivations, and their goals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The lawyers practice in an age where cell phone and body cameras have captured fatal encounters with police. Their tactics are strategic and media-savvy. Their goal is to hold abusive officers accountable and force systemic changes in policing in this country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When you hear us advocate, we're not advocating for a settlement, we're advocating for an indictment,"" Merritt said. ""We're advocating for a conviction.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The video that changed the narrative</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart arrived at the Scott family home in North Charleston, South Carolina, in the middle of the night, the day after Walter Scott was shot dead. He carried only a duffel bag and two suits, thinking he wouldn't be there for long.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart didn't go home for two months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They started having to FedEx me suits and clothes,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As an attorney, Stewart had mostly handled sexual assault cases in his career. In 2014 he took on the case of Gregory Towns, who died in police custody after two East Point, Georgia, officers used a stun gun on him while he was handcuffed. Both officers were convicted, including one for murder, <a href=""https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/south-fulton-county/former-east-point-officer-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-mans-taser-murder/477823504"" target=""_blank"">according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV</a>. The family and city also settled a lawsuit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walter Scott's family had heard about that case -- and so they reached out to Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family was not convinced that the police account of what happened to Scott was accurate. Police said at the time that an officer pulled Scott over for a broken tail light and a foot chase followed. The officer said he used a stun gun on Scott; Scott tried to take that weapon and the officer shot him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We knew my brother and what he was about,"" Anthony Scott told CNN. ""He was never the type of guy that would fight a cop.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family would later learn that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/09/us/south-carolina-witness-video/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Feidin Santana</a>, a bystander, had recorded Walter Scott's last moments.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana had sent a screenshot of the footage to a Black Lives Matter activist, who told Scott's family about it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana went to the home of another one of Walter Scott's brothers to meet Stewart and his co-counsel, Justin Bamberg. But Santana didn't want to stay there; he was scared for his life. They drove around and finally settled on a secluded parking lot, Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It took Stewart and Bamberg several hours to convince Santana to show them the video and give it to them. It showed North Charleston police officer Michael Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away. ""This can't be real,"" Stewart remembered thinking when he saw the video. ""A police officer wouldn't just unload on somebody like that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late that night, the lawyers turned the video over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The state agency released it to the public days after Scott was killed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The video changed the narrative of the shooting and sparked outrage across the country. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Slager was charged with murder and fired. Stewart also helped to secure a $6.5 million settlement for the Scott family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Slager's murder trial ended in <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/michael-slager-murder-trial-walter-scott-mistrial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a hung jury</a> in December 2016. Everyone lost hope, but ""we just never gave up on it and kept pushing,"" Stewart said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A year later, Slager was <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentenced to 20 years</a> in a federal prison after he pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Filled with gratitude, Stewart and Scott's family gathered in a back room in the courthouse with the lead prosecutor after the sentencing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They held hands in a circle and prayed. Stewart asked Scott's mother, Judy, to speak to the media.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Facing reporters, she held a framed photo of her son against her chest as the nation watched. Stewart spoke first.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He called it ""a historic day for civil rights, particularly in officer-involved shootings."" Stewart wanted to convey the magnitude of such a sentence for a police officer. It was the ""best of inadequate justice"" that civil rights cases get, he said recalling that moment. ""This is all people crave, is accountability.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Nine out of 10 times, the families don't get justice, the community doesn't observe justice and it's just written off,"" Stewart said. ""And it just goes away, then it's just kind of a lasting open wound."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The work takes its toll</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In April 2017, Roy Oliver, then an officer in Balch Springs, Texas, opened fire on a car full of teenagers as they drove past him leaving a party. Police claimed they had heard gunshots outside the house; Oliver said he thought the car was moving aggressively toward his partner.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A bullet struck 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, a passenger in the car, in the head, killing him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Details of the killing seep into attorney Merritt's dreams, giving him nightmares -- like the way Jordan's brothers described him getting shot, smoke rising from Jordan's forehead.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Instead of it being Jordan, it's my 9-year-old,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Civil rights law is not an easy field, the attorneys say. Cases take years to settle. The work is disruptive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt has struggled with depression. Online trolls forced Stewart to hire private security at his house during the Scott case, and again when he represented the family of Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black father who was shot dead by one of two white officers who confronted him outside a Louisiana convenience store in 2016. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump, 49, has received threatening phone calls and letters over the years.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">L. Chris Stewart, S. Lee Merritt and Benjamin Crump have bonded since serving on a panel at a National Bar Association conference over the summer. They talk often in a group text that includes other civil rights lawyers. The conversation is wide-ranging, jumping from legal strategy to college football to holiday greetings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What everybody respects about each other is that somebody's stepping up doing this, because there are just not a lot of people that will take a civil rights case,"" Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police-involved shootings <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/us/police-deadly-force-trials/index.html"" target=""_blank"">rarely end in convictions</a>. Jurors and the broader public often give police officers the benefit of the doubt, and there is often a high burden of proof. The federal statute used to evaluate police shootings, for example, requires a finding that the officer willfully or intentionally sought to kill someone. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Approaching new cases, the attorneys' first step is to make sure enough evidence is available and that public pressure is strong enough for charges to be brought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Jordan's case, Merritt took affidavits from witnesses and directed them to the district attorney's office. A Dallas County grand jury indicted Oliver for murder about three months after the fatal shooting, and his case went to trial. After hours of deliberations, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/us/texas-officer-convicted-jordan-edwards-death/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a jury convicted him</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also had success with this strategy when he took on the case of Botham Jean. Amber Guyger, an off-duty Dallas police officer, fired two shots at Jean after she says she mistakenly entered his apartment at a complex where she also lived.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt's office obtained an affidavit from a witness who said they heard knocking on Jean's door shortly before Guyger, who lived directly above Jean, entered his apartment and killed him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also called for Guyger to be fired and charged.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Guyger was indicted for murder on December 1. Her trial is set for September 23, according to <a href=""https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/04/03/trial-dallas-officer-amber-guyger-botham-jean/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate KTVT</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The roots of their strategy</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham Jean's mother, Allison, had traveled to the United States many times, but she wasn't familiar with the justice system at the time of her son's death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham's aunt, who lives in Florida, reached out to Crump. Allison Jean remembered him from his work representing Trayvon Martin's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A Texas state senator recommended Merritt, but Jean still wasn't sure. She asked a friend who was an attorney in St. Lucia to research Merritt. ""Given what had happened to my son, I was looking at everybody with much apprehension,"" said Jean, a former government official in St. Lucia.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But she quickly grew comfortable with Merritt, Crump and Daryl Washington, a Texas attorney. The three men spent up to 12 hours a day with her during her first week in Dallas, holding her hand at times, she said. Crump often checked to see if she had eaten.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They met me at the hotel. They came to ... the memorial service,"" she said. ""They met me at the (district attorney's office). We just spent the entire day together, for an entire week. They never left my side,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt kept the Jeans<strong> </strong>company one night after a Dallas County grand jury failed to indict Guyger in its first day of deliberation. He passed the time playing dominoes with Allison Jean's husband.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""That helped to quell my anxiety,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Getting to know the family and their loved one is a crucial part of representing these cases, Crump said. Crump has encouraged his clients to talk publicly about their loved ones to reshape the public narrative about them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We have never met these young people of color, who've been killed by the police, in life,"" Crump said. ""We only meet them in death. And we have to then bring them back to life in the media.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump encourages the families to help the world know the person they knew, and not just the person described in a police report or shown in a grainy viral video.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are always going to be more effective in telling who Botham Jean was,"" he told Jean's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because their legal strategy is often tied to media interviews and press conferences, some criticize the attorneys for sowing division -- trying to grab headlines rather than finding common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Charley Wilkison, executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, a police union, said police are often criticized and second-guessed, but they have the fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the criminal justice system does deserve criticism, he said, it's still important to find common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""While we're preaching tolerance in the country, it kind of behooves all of us to find a middle, that's just very unpopular right now in this country,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The tolerance that they're calling for is not being practiced,"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In response, Merritt said that ""when I or other attorneys call out law enforcement for the extremely hazardous, deadly culture that is unique in the world, it's because it's really bad.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't know that they get that,"" he said. ""The black community gets it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How civil rights became their calling</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt, 36, rose to prominence after he represented Mark Hughes, the man Dallas police incorrectly identified as a suspect in the fatal shooting of five officers in a July 2016 protest against police-involved shootings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt said he started a campaign ""to clear him in the eyes of the public.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned much of this legal strategy from Johnnie Cochran, the lead attorney defending O.J. Simpson when he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. ""Cochran used to play his cases out in the media, use the media to create political pressure,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump credited Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall as his inspiration to practice law. In elementary school, Crump was bused to a new predominantly white school in Lumberton, North Carolina. His mother worked at a factory and a hotel for little pay.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned from his mother and teachers that he could attend the school because Marshall, then an attorney for the NAACP, argued Brown v. Board of Education before the US Supreme Court, leading to the desegregation of public schools.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to be like Thurgood Marshall because I want to make it good for people who live in my community and people who look like me,"" Crump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His respect for Marshall even influences how he decides which cases to take. A case must ""shock my conscience,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart's conscience was shocked by the injustice he saw in a small Florida town more than a decade ago. The Tulane University graduate, who studied public health, found himself angry as he sat in a room in Florida with an attorney and residents who believed they were sick with cancer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the time, Stewart worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, monitoring cancer clusters in low-income communities. Stewart heard the lawyers for the company that owned a chemical plant near a water source -- the suspected cause of the cancer -- laughing about golf in another room. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That flippant attitude angered Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> ""If I see something wrong and I think I can do something about it, then I do something about it,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Lesser-known figures on the front lines</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For every one of these attorneys in the national spotlight, there are many others addressing civil rights issues around the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before Michele K. Rayner-Goolsby was born, her parents were among some of the first black students to enroll at the University of South Florida in the 1960s. Her parents taught her to help others and lift her community up as she advanced. She recalled watching her mom, who was a social worker, give a bag of groceries to a homeless client they found standing in front of a grocery store.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby hadn't planned to focus on civil rights cases, but during an internship with a public defenders' office in Florida she began to encounter clients who alleged their rights were violated.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, the 37-year-old attorney represents the family of Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot last summer during an altercation over a parking space at a convenience store in Clearwater, Florida, her hometown. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri initially said he wouldn't arrest Michael Drejka, the man who shot McGlockton, citing the state's ""stand your ground"" law. The law grants immunity to a person who uses deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, or to prevent a forcible felony.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby spent that weekend protesting the department's decision. The next day, McGlockton's family sought her help. Drejka was later charged with manslaughter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He pleaded not guilty after he was charged last summer. His trial is scheduled to start in August, according to <a href=""https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/-stand-your-ground-shooter-michael-drejka-murder-trial-set-for-august-2019/1660624030"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WFLA</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though her colleagues may have gotten more national attention in recent years, Rayner-Goolsby said ""there are a lot of women and queer folks that are doing this work"" who ""are powerful voices right now on the front lines."" But they often get pushed aside for ""male charismatic figures that are able to draw crowds,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The fight continues</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Stewart, Merritt and Crump have gained national attention, they've gotten more and more requests to take cases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In recent years, Stewart's office has gotten so many requests, he says he has had to turn down 90% of them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart now represents<strong> </strong>the family of Antwon Golatte, a black man who survived being shot by Chicago police during a traffic stop in 2015, according to <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/02/08/antwon-golatte-chicago-police-shooting-lawsuit/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WBBM-TV</a>. A police review board later ruled the shooting unjustified.

The 12 1/2 year <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentence</a> he received Friday for the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk is outrageous and disturbing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Police are seldom -- if ever -- indicted, much less convicted, for shooting African American men. Yet, where the victim here is a white woman and the police officer is black, he gets the book thrown at him. This sentence is lengthy and unjust,and shows a capitulation by the judge against her oath to administer justice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mohamed Noor, a 33-year-old Somali-American, who was serving as a police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) back on July 15, 2017, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/us/minneapolis-officer-noor-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">had been convicted</a> of murder and manslaughter. <a href=""https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/05/14/mohamed-noor-appeals-conviction-in-shooting-death/"" target=""_blank"">According to</a> local station WCCO, Noor has appealed the conviction. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I've thought and prayed about this for two years, since the time I took"" her life, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Noor said</a> before the sentencing. The state had asked for 150 months, while Noor's attorneys argued for a probationary sentence. During the hearing, Ruszczyk's fiancé, Don Damond, made an emotional statement: ""I'm not sure how such a thing could happen to you, to us."" Before announcing his fate, Judge Kathryn Quaintance said, ""Good people sometimes do bad things."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A court should never succumb to the desire for vengeance. Officer Noor is the first officer convicted in Minnesota in such a circumstance. And he happens to be black. Coincidence? He had <a href=""https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/05/before-sentencing-noor-supporters-speak-of-his-kindness-and-compassion"" target=""_blank"">44 letters</a> submitted to the Court which spoke to his character, gentle nature and community service. His ex-wife even weighed in to inform the court of his humanitarian efforts and kind demeanor -- all to no avail. Even a local legislator wrote a letter urging the court to spare him jail. Nope. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During Noor's trial, the jury of ten men and two women heard from 60 witnesses over the course of a month, whose testimony included prosecution and defense ""use of force"" experts. Not surprisingly, these experts offered completely different opinions as to whether Officer Noor acted ""reasonably"" in discharging a single round of his service revolver into the abdomen of Justine Ruszczyk, who had called 911 to report a possible assault happening in an alley near her home.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From the defense perspective, Officer Noor was ""startled"" in a dark alley and feared for his life. In that darkness, he perceived a deadly threat as he sat in the passenger seat of his police cruiser, and saw someone approaching him and his partner, Matthew Harrity, who was way too close for comfort.  Officer Noor's contention is that he fired upon the perceived threat in order to protect his life and that of his vulnerable partner, who was a sitting duck in the driver's seat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The prosecution countered with a critical question that seemingly said it all: ""What is threatening about blond hair and a pink T-Shirt?"" And with that said, we as a society must address the elephant in the room: Race. Officer Noor is an African American man. Ms. Ruszczyk, the victim, was a white woman from Australia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every police shooting, like other cases, turns on its own set of facts. Those facts are often varied and murky. But despite the factual inconsistencies in some police shooting cases, there is generally one constant: the lack of accountability for the officer firing the weapon. Not in this case. Here, there was an indictment, a prosecution and a guilty verdict. So here's the obvious question: did the race of the officer and the victim play a role in the outcome? What are the moral questions involved in the prosecutor's invoking the victim's ""blondeness"" to imply she posed no threat?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How and why is it that Noor was convicted? When a white officer shoots an African American male, the results too often seem like fait accompli. In those instances, the officers are generally not even indicted, much less found guilty at trial. Some may be quick to contradict this claim by pointing to Officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/us/jason-van-dyke-chicago-police-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Laquan McDonald</a> on October 14, 2014. They may also point to Officer Michael Slager in South Carolina, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Walter Scott </a>in April 4, 2015.  But both of these examples are false comparisons. And in fact, they are not even close.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Van Dyke's case, there was a stomach-turning video completely contradicting Van Dyke's narrative as to what occurred. His police report indicated that McDonald was lunging at him, but on camera, Van Dyke is shown firing repeatedly upon McDonald, even as he lies dying on the ground. In the absence of the video one wonders whether there would have even been a prosecution, much less a conviction? And for his crime, Van Dyke was only sentenced to six years and nine months in prison.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In South Carolina, Michael Slager shot Walter Scott in the back as he was running away. Thereafter, he planted evidence. Perhaps because the jurors could not believe their lying eyes, his case ended in a mistrial. It was not until the Justice Department intervened, and a sought a life sentence, that Slager <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">pled guilty and accepted 20 years</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Noor's situation, there is no video tape nor audio evidence. Both Noor and Garrity wore body cameras but they were not turned on and Noor did not provide a statement. In such a circumstance, the conviction of a police officer is unheard of. In fact, Mike Freeman, the prosecutor in Hennepin County, where Noor was tried and convicted, could not identify a single instance in Minnesota's history where a police officer was convicted in such a circumstance. Coincidence?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, a year before this incident, also in Minnesota, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Philando Castile was killed</a> by Officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop. He was shot seven times even though he specifically told the officer that he had a weapon when he was asked to produce his license and registration. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat, looked on in terror -- as did her four-year-old daughter.   Officer Yanez was tried on three felony counts and acquitted on each. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It seems the jury was persuaded that Officer Yanez legitimately feared for his life. The facts would not allow the prosecutor to ask the question that was asked in Noor's case, namely, ""What is so threatening about a blonde?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The uncomfortable questions about this case don't have good answers, but we must ask them nonetheless. Was Noor afforded the same deference by the jury as his counterparts of a different hue? Unlike other officer-involved shootings, this time, the person wearing a blue uniform was Somali, African American, and Muslim. Can't he be just as frightened as his fellow officers were when they discharged their weapons against unarmed black men?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And should a white suspect be viewed as putting a police officer at ease while a black suspect heightens an officer's fear and anxiety? How and why can a prosecutor argue so matter-of-factly that ""a blonde in a pink shirt"" is harmless, while a person with coarse hair, who happens to be black, represents a significant danger? How stereotypical is that? But that was the very argument made here -- and it was overwhelmingly successful.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Interestingly, the shooting also occurred in the district of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the first naturalized citizen from Africa, the first nonwhite woman from Minnesota, and one of the first two Muslim women, to serve in Congress. In that regard, society has come a long way. But it appears we have much further to go.    </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every life is precious and every questionable police-involved shooting is gut-wrenching. We grieve for the family -- no matter the color. Police shootings provide police departments across the country with an opportunity to learn and to improve. In this case, police procedures were re-evaluated and revamped -- as was officer training. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But while revamping police procedures and training, we need to also revamp our cultural attitudes. The sentencing of Mohamed Noor is not even close to the end of this story. Yes, police must be held accountable for their unlawful transgressions. No one can ever be above the law. But the law must apply with equal force to police officers of every color and origin. Similarly, the way in which jurors evaluate these tragic police shootings should never turn on the color of a victim's hair or skin. Instead, the critical inquiry must continue to be whether the officer reasonably perceived a legitimate threat to his or her life. And that must always be a color-blind assessment.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We need to do some soul searching as a society to see how this could happen. Courts should promote justice -- not propagate injustice. And that's exactly what happened here. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This article has been updated to clarify that Justine Ruszczyk was shot in the abdomen, not the chest.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">The announcement was a dramatic reversal of a sudden tariff threat that Trump himself announced last week in an attempt to put more pressure on the Mexican government to stem the flow of migrants into the US. Trump spent much of the intervening period out of the country, visiting with European leaders and attending a state dinner in the United Kingdom, while US and Mexican negotiators worked feverishly in Washington to avoid <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/tariffs-us-manufacturing-vietnam/index.html"" target=""_blank"">another escalation in his foreign trade wars.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump has leaned on tariffs as a favorite bargaining mechanism, including in his ongoing dispute with China, with mixed results, and his Mexico threats drew open opposition from top Republican senators as well as blowback from the business community.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His decision to back off three days of intense discussions in Washington between Mexican officials and the Trump administration, with talks between Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and State Department officials lasting for more than 11 hours Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods entering the US if Mexico did not limit the number of Central American migrants moving through the country to the US. He said late Friday, after he had returned to the White House from his <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/donald-trump-mexico-politics-dday-britain-immigration/index.html"" target=""_blank"">visit to Europe for D-Day commemorations</a>, that the Mexican officials had agreed to his demands.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's assertion was met with derision from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has crossed swords with the President repeatedly over immigration -- particularly over Trump's demands for money to build a border wall, which triggered a record-long government shutdown last fall.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late Friday, the New York Democrat tweeted: ""This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to 'greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.' Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A declaration amid a crisis</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The United States and Mexico signed onto a joint declaration as a result of the negotiations. The State Department said in a statement that as part of the agreement, Mexico will take ""unprecedented steps"" to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, including the deployment of its National Guard throughout the country -- giving priority to Mexico's southern border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The countries also agreed that individuals caught crossing into the US from Mexico seeking asylum will be ""rapidly returned"" to Mexico where they will await consideration of their asylum claims. Mexico, the declaration says, will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals. Mexico says it will offer jobs, health care and education to those people. In return, the US must expedite the asylum adjudication process.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The declaration also reiterates the countries' commitment from last year, which emphasizes US support for development in Central America and southern Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, the agreement does not include requiring asylum seekers to first apply for asylum in the US while in Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the US got what it wanted from Mexico in terms of border enforcement and breaking up trafficking networks, the US did not get Mexico to agree to have asylum seekers from Central America face asylum proceedings in Mexico or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Discussions will continue and the two countries may announce further efforts within the next 90 days if necessary, the statement said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The deal comes amid a surge in migrants crossing into the US, straining the resources of federal immigration and border authorities. More than 144,000 migrants were encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/southern-border-migrants/index.html"" target=""_blank"">US Customs and Border Protection said this week</a>, a roughly 32% increase from the previous month and the highest monthly total in more than a decade.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of those, nearly 133,000 crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, including more than 11,000 unaccompanied children.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexico has already pledged to send about 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a bid to cut off the flow of Central American migrants whose journey to the US's southern border has led to the steep spike in border crossings in recent months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But US officials demanded more.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US officials pressed Mexico to change its asylum policy by entering into a ""safe third country"" agreement with the US. Mexico had rejected those offers in the past, but US officials said Mexico was more open to some version of this idea in talks on Thursday. The goal was to require Central American migrants to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/trump-rule-asylum-change/index.html"" target=""_blank"">face asylum proceedings in Mexico</a> or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican officials, meanwhile, urged the US to address the root causes of Central American migration by investing in programs that would reduce poverty and violence in those countries. Trump, though, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/30/politics/state-department-aid-el-slavador-guatemala-honduras/index.html"" target=""_blank"">moved earlier this year to cut US foreign aid to those countries</a>, a move even US officials say is counterproductive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Diplomats celebrate avoiding tariff confrontation</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday night praised his counterpart in the Mexican Foreign Ministry, thanking Ebrard and his team for their hard work in negotiating a deal.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We would like to thank Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard for his hard work to negotiate a set of joint obligations that benefit both the United States and Mexico,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""The United States looks forward to working alongside Mexico to fulfill these commitments so that we can stem the tide of illegal migration across our southern border and to make our border strong and secure.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican Ambassador to the US Martha Barcena also praised Ebrard, and said the deal would address what she called a humanitarian crisis on the border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico will strengthen the measures for the implementation of its immigration law. Provide job, education and health opportunities for people who wait in Mexican territory for the end of their asylum process in the US,"" Barcena tweeted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a news conference following the announcement of the declaration, Ebrard told reporters that it was a fair deal. He said that the Mexican delegation had moderated some of the US' requests, such as a safe third country agreement, which would require asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to make their case for American asylum in Mexico. But Mexico did allow others, such as an expansion to Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would return asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think it is a fair balance because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point,"" he said. ""For instance, they accepted to support the program that Mexico proposed in Central America. They proposed in the first meeting to have (a) third safe state, which is not the case here, which is very important. And on the other hand, we accepted to have a more extended version of 235 and to accelerate the deployment of the national guard. So it's a fair play, I think.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Days of pressured negotiations</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Administration officials had said earlier Friday that they were prepared to move forward with the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">threatened tariffs on Mexico</a>, even as negotiations continued in Washington over addressing the immigration issues at the heart of the standoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration was expected to submit legal notification on Friday of its intention to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">implement tariffs Monday on Mexico</a>, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short said. But Short said Trump could ""turn that off"" over the weekend if negotiations ""continue to go well,"" which appeared to be the route Trump chose Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a legal notification that goes forward today with a plan to implement tariffs on Monday, but I think there is the ability -- if negotiations continue to go well -- that the President can turn that off at some point over the weekend,"" Short had told reporters at the White House on Friday morning.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump faced a Friday deadline to sign an executive order to ensure the tariffs go into effect by Monday, his deadline for Mexico to meet his immigration demands or face a 5% tariff on all exports to the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/white-house-mexico-tariff-immigration-talks/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump on Thursday</a> had said ""a lot of progress was made"" earlier this week in talks with Mexican officials, but repeatedly stood by his vow to impose the tariffs, despite criticism from some Republicans, who have urged him to delay the implementation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/mexico-tariffs-republican-senators-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Some Republican lawmakers had expressed concern</a> about the impact of tariffs on all goods that cross into the US from Mexico, a move that could ultimately lead to higher prices for US consumers and hurt US businesses as well as the Mexican economy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short hit back at the uneasy Republican lawmakers earlier Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We wish that members of Congress would spend as much time looking to fix the problem legislatively as they do bellyaching about what the President is doing trying to fix the problem,"" Short said when asked about Republican opposition to his tariffs.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short said specifically that the administration wants Congress to change US asylum laws that ""allow families to basically come across the border and be protected and let go into our United States until the adjudication process completes.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This story has been updated.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Greg Clary and Jenny Hansler contributed to this report.</p>]"

Maybe once every two years you'd see something like this, if even that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's absolutely no explanation as to how I contracted it,"" said Palma.

The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said.

Two of the three girls were 6-year-old Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, both daughters of Honeychurch.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was an answer to a question that had remained <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/new-hampshire-cold-case-homicides/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a mystery for decades</a>. Authorities on Thursday said the breakthrough was a result of information from relatives, DNA testing, genealogy research — and the diligent research of Heath. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her first lead didn't go anywhere</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In January 2017, investigators announced that a man named Bob Evans had likely killed the four female victims discovered in Bear Brook State Park. In August of that year, they announced that ""Bob Evans"" was an alias for Terrence ""Terry"" Rasmussen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasmussen went by many names over the years. He was linked to the 1981 disappearance of a woman in New Hampshire that he was thought to be dating and was serving time for the murder of his wife in California when he died of natural causes in 2010.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though investigators had identified Rasmussen as the man who likely killed the four Bear Brook victims in 2017, the victims' identities were still a mystery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For years, helping connect people to their missing loved ones had been a hobby of Heath's. Combined with her interest in the Rasmussen case, she got to work on trying to find potential matches for the victims in November 2017. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She scoured ancestry message boards for terms like ""California,"" where Rasmussen had been arrested, or ""missing sister"" in hopes of finding a relative of the victims. Then she began compiling a list of names. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would just go through that list and then I would start searching to see if they had public records, if the person was alive, see if I could find any record for their existence,"" Heath said. ""If not, then I would pursue it a little further and reach out to the person who had originally posted looking for the loved ones.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath said she found a posting from around 1999 about a relative looking for Sarah McWaters and her mother Marlyse McWaters. As she conducted further searches for Marlyse McWaters, Heath came across other relatives looking for the same woman. It turned out McWaters was also the mother of a girl named Marie Vaughn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a Facebook group about the Rasmussen case, Heath asked whether those missing people could be the victims found in Allenstown, but she didn't get much of a response. So, she dropped it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She followed up a year later</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About a year later, Heath, who lives in Connecticut, was listening to a New Hampshire Public Radio podcast about the Bear Brook murders when information about the victims reminded her again of the woman looking for Sarah McWaters on that ancestry message board. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At that point I was like, I need to reach out to this woman,"" Heath said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The listing contained an email address, so Heath said she tried to match the address to a Facebook profile. Heath reached out to one woman asking whether she was the same person who had made the ancestry posting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes, Heath received a response. It was her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath asked the relative if she had any more information about Sarah and Marlyse McWaters. The woman started sharing more details, including that Marlyse had married a man with the last name Rasmussen. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Right there, my stomach jumped,"" Heath said. ""It just rocked. I knew right away. There's no way that a woman goes missing with those children with a guy with that last name, Rasmussen. It's just way too coincidental.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath didn't say anything to the relative of Sarah McWaters about Rasmussen's criminal history just yet, but she said she began reaching out to relatives of Marie Vaughn. Vaughn's relatives told Heath that Vaughn's mother had left California with a man named Terry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>It all came together in the same week</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within two hours, Heath said she was on the phone with law enforcement in San Bernardino, California. Those authorities quickly turned the information over to investigators in New Hampshire who were already examining DNA research based on information from the family of Marie Vaughn and other genetic databases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through advances in DNA technology, investigators were able to obtain DNA profiles of the degraded remains from the barrels. Barbara Rae-Venter, a genetic genealogist who also helped crack the Golden State Killer case, was able to confirm the identities of the victims via searches through DNA databases, according to New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That, plus the information that came in from Heath and the DNA samples from Sarah McWaters' family, allowed them to make the final determination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Her work and our work converged, and it turns out that she was correct,"" Strelzin told CNN.

Amy Klobuchar) land at 2% each, the rest hold 1% support or less.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The poll is the first from CNN and the Des Moines Register since the Iowa Democratic Party formally proposed rules for its new virtual caucus. The rules allocate 90% of state delegate equivalents based on the results among those who caucus in-person, while 10% will be based on the results among those who caucus virtually, regardless of the actual number of people who choose to participate each way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the poll, 28% of those who say they are definitely or probably going to participate at this point say they are likely to do so virtually. Although Biden fares better among likely virtual participants (33%) than among likely in-person caucusgoers (23%), combining likely caucus participants' preferences according to the new rules does not move the numbers meaningfully for any candidate from what they would have been if the 90 to 10 ratio had not been applied. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But those rules could bring a slew of new people to the caucuses next February. Those who say they are likely to participate virtually are more likely to be first-time caucus attendees (52% vs. 17% of those who say they'll attend in-person), they are more apt to be registered as independents (31% vs. 11% among likely in-person attendees) and they are younger (63% under age 45 vs. 51% among in-person attendees).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Beyond Biden's lower overall support, the poll also suggests some warning signs for him beneath those numbers. His supporters are less apt than others to say they are ""extremely enthusiastic"" about him (29% vs. 39% for backers of all other candidates, and 43% among those backing his nearest competition in Sanders, Warren or Buttigieg). He also remains the best-known candidate in the field, suggesting he has less room to grow than other candidates who Iowa's Democratic caucusgoers are still getting to know.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The closer contest in Iowa also suggests a steeper challenge for 2016 runner-up Sanders than he faces elsewhere. In most national polling, he has held second place solo or been competitive with Biden, as he has in earlier Iowa surveys. In this poll, Sanders fares better with those who are less committed to showing up on caucus night. Among those who say they will probably attend in-person, he stands at 20%, while among those who say they are definite attenders, he's at 14%. That pattern holds among those who plan to attend virtually.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The results are also notable for the lack of traction by most of the 23-candidate field tested in the poll. The survey asked likely caucusgoers to name their first and second choice candidates, and then for each other candidate, asked whether the potential caucusgoer was ""actively considering"" that candidate, or not.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among likely in-person caucusgoers, only five candidates were in active consideration by a majority: Biden (61%), Warren (61%), Sanders (56%), Buttigieg (52%) and Harris (52%). The next closest candidates were under active consideration by about 4 in 10: Cory Booker at 43% and O'Rourke at 39%. Among potential virtual caucusgoers, the picture is similar. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's notable among both likely in-person and likely virtual caucusgoers is just how few are even considering some of the lower-tier candidates. Thirteen of the 23 tested candidates are under consideration by fewer than 2 in 10 in either group, that includes both candidates who have won election statewide (Jay Inslee, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock) as well as those who are making outsider bids for the nomination (Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Wayne Messam). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Outside of candidate preferences, about two-thirds of likely caucusgoers, regardless of how they plan to participate, say they would prefer that the winner in Iowa be someone with a strong chance of beating Trump over a candidate who shares their views on major issues. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when asked to choose among desirable qualities in a candidate, electability ranked fourth on a list of seven for both sets of possible caucus participants. A majority in both groups named integrity a top trait (56% among in-person, 61% among virtual), and 40% in each chose intelligence. Just over a third in each group picked leadership (34% in-person, 36% virtual) and about a quarter picked electability (25% in-person and 23% virtual). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likely Iowa caucusgoers are divided over how Democrats in Congress ought to handle the possibility of impeachment proceedings for Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About half of likely Iowa caucusgoers (48% regardless of how they plan to participate), say they think Democrats in Congress ought to continue investigating the President rather than move forward on formal impeachment proceedings now. Slightly fewer in each group say they think congressional Democrats would be shirking their constitutional duty if they do not move ahead on impeachment as soon as possible (42% among in-person, 45% among virtual).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, from June 2 through 5 among a random sample of 600 likely Democratic caucus participants reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. The sample included 433 who said they plan to attend the caucuses in-person and 167 who said they plan to attend virtually. Results for the combined sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is 4.7 points for those planning to attend in-person, 7.6 points for those who plan to attend virtually.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify Trump's event in Iowa.</p>]"

Two years after it launched, the group has gained a reputation, not as a financial powerhouse for a sitting president, but as an aimless operation struggling to deliver for Trump politically.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Interviews with six GOP operatives and donors reveal a deep frustration, not just over the group's spending habits, but also its lackluster fundraising. In the 2018 cycle, chairman and president Brian O. Walsh told CNN that America First and its affiliated non-profit together raised about $75 million, well short of its $100 million goal. About $39 million of that went to the super PAC, Federal Election Commission records show.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By comparison, the Republican National Committee raised more than $233 million in individual contributions in the same cycle. While America First's operating expenses appear to be within the normal realm for super PACs, critics say the money the group has raised has been misspent on large consulting contracts and high-cost events with little payoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last cycle, as Republicans were on their way to losing their House majority, America First was paying the equivalent of annual salaries to firms attached to Trump associates such as Sean Spicer, Katrina Pierson and Corey Lewandowski (a former CNN contributor), not to mention Clarke, fueling the perception that the group has become a safe harbor for various Trump cast-offs and family friends.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a perception that people who got fired from the administration or couldn't get administration jobs were just dumped there,"" says a Republican operative aligned with the President's re-election effort who has spoken with potential donors to America First. ""What fundraising they have done they've squandered on parties and other stupid things.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Trump prepares to officially kick off his re-election campaign this month, Republicans around Washington have started asking the same question: What, exactly, is the President's top super PAC doing? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New leadership</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After years of the President dismissing super PACs as a ""scam,"" the Trump campaign in a May 7 statement <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/politics/trump-2020-and-big-money/index.html"" target=""_blank"">endorsed America First</a> as the ""one approved outside, non-campaign group."" The embrace reflected the view among his political apparatus that Trump needed to point donors to a single independent vehicle, but some Republicans are questioning whether America First is up to the task. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been a disaster,"" said one GOP operative close to the Trump campaign. ""I mean, totally lackluster leadership.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brad Parscale, who helped launch America First's non-profit policy arm in late January 2017, left a year later <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/brad-parscale-donald-trump-2020/index.html"" target=""_blank"">to manage Trump's 2020 campaign</a>, taking Pierson with him as the campaign's senior adviser. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In February, America First's chairman, longtime Trump family friend Tommy Hicks, left to join the RNC as its co-chair. In April, Linda McMahon, the Small Business Administration chief, resigned her Cabinet post and came aboard as America First's chairwoman.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and a two-time Republican senate candidate, is viewed by some skeptics as an acknowledgment of its past troubles. But so far the move has been welcomed by a number of donors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda McMahon joining America First marked a reset for them as they reload from the disastrous midterms to be Trump's wingman for a successful 2020 campaign,"" said Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based oil investor, Republican donor, and Trump supporter who gave $5,000 to America First in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda was brought in to see how to build confidence with the donor community and also to build a war chest to re-elect the president,"" says one Republican source.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked how fundraising has been going since she came on board, McMahon was upbeat about her conversations with donors. ""You have conversations, then you have follow-ups, then people come to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But all the initial responses that I am getting is that they are very delighted."" The next fundraising report to the FEC is due next month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Limited influence</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a super PAC, America First cannot contribute directly to a candidate's campaign or a party committee. It is limited to making ""independent expenditures"" -- advertisements, polling, and get-out-the-vote infrastructure -- and cannot coordinate with those candidates or campaigns. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But America First can also accept donations of any size from individuals, corporations, and other non-political organizations. That's what gives groups like it the chance to be ""super,"" and why some Republicans fear America First is failing to live up to its potential.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an interview with CNN, Walsh acknowledged the criticism that's been leveled at the group, but he pushed back on the idea America First hasn't delivered for the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We were active in '17 during the health care debate, and then we were active during tax reform. We did a lot of polling,"" Walsh said, pointing to 26 events with Vice President Mike Pence promoting tax reform.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But its influence was limited. Trump's tax cuts remain underwater in public approval. And Congress was unable to pass the White House-backed health care proposals while Republicans controlled the House.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First also paid for ads during the 2018 midterm elections on behalf of GOP congressional candidates, some of whom were in likely 2020 battleground states and others that were what Walsh called ""Trump Champions,"" or candidates who were particularly supportive of the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The group had a winning record in 2018 -- four of the six Senate candidates and seven of the 13 House candidates it backed won their races, including two House seats that flipped to the GOP, according to America First. Still, for the super PAC of a sitting president, America First wasn't much of a factor, a point that Walsh acknowledged. ""We were a supporting entity in the midterms, we will be a principal entity in the presidential,"" he told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>""Branding mechanisms""</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The biggest concern among Republicans is the super PAC's ""warehousing"" (as one Republican donor to the group put it) of figures from the broader Trump orbit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""communications consulting"" to firms linked to people affiliated with Trump, including Lewandowski, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson, according to the group's public filing with the FEC. Spicer's public relations firm RigWil received more than $53,000 in the last six months of 2018, while Pierson's consulting firm was paid $60,000 between October 2017 and February 2018 before she left to join Trump's 2020 campaign.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two firms tied to Clarke, DAC Enterprises and Ranger Zuke, received a total of $120,000 from the super PAC between September 2017 and November 2018. Clarke had been turned down for multiple positions in the Trump administration before being named a senior advisor and spokesman for America First in September 2017. Clarke's association with the group ended last year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lewandowski's firm Green Monster Consulting, meanwhile, was paid $75,000 for ""strategy consulting"" over the nine months he was America First's senior advisor. He left in March 2018 to join Vice President Pence's Great America PAC. (""Let Trump Be Trump,"" the book Lewandowski wrote with fellow Trump campaign veteran David Bossie, is displayed behind the front desk of America First's 8th floor suite in a shiny new office building in Crystal City, Virginia.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked about their work for America First, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson referred CNN to the group's spokeswoman, Kelly Sadler.

It wasn't exactly unusual for Kan to share personal details about himself: He once livestreamed his life through the startup he co-founded in 2007 called Justin.tv, which ultimately became Twitch, the popular live streaming platform for gamers now owned by Amazon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The same day he tweeted, Kan launched a group on chat app Telegram to connect with others who were similarly deciding to get sober from alcohol. He didn't expect that more than 1,000 people would join. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New products for the sober — and 'sober curious'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Their <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/29/news/companies/bud-light-miller-lite-budweiser-coors-light/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sales of alcoholic beverages</a> have been <a href=""https://www.theiwsr.com/news-and-comment-worldwide-alcohol-consumption-declines/"" target=""_blank"">declining</a>, big alcohol companies, ranging from Heineken to AB InBev (the owner of popular beer brands such as Budweiser), see an opportunity: They're<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/business/heineken-no-alcohol-beer/index.html"" target=""_blank""> investing in non-</a>, or low-alcohol drinks. So too, startup investors and entrepreneurs are hoping to cater to the ""sober curious,"" people who for the sake of wellness are reevaluating their relationships with alcohol and how often they drink. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The emergence of sober bars is one of the signals that investor Anu Duggal points to when talking about the trend of not drinking. Duggal, who is based in New York City, said that like Kan, she is noticing ""a number of people who are choosing not to drink."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Duggal's firm, Female Founders Fund — which has backed popular consumer startups such as Rent The Runway — is a recent investor in <a href=""https://www.kineuphorics.com/"" target=""_blank"">Kin Euphorics</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kin's first product is a non-alcoholic beverage called ""High Rhode."" It is part adaptogen (a nontoxic plant that is claimed to have de-stressing effects), part nootropics (a supplement said to help with cognitive functions), and part botanics. On its <a href=""https://www.kineuphorics.com/"" target=""_blank"">website,</a> the company notes that its statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration and that its product is not intended to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure any disease. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rather than an indulgence, Kin reasons that the consumption of its product is more for ""self care after dark."" It wants to create a new market of products that don't contain alcohol but also aren't laden with sugar. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kin is co-founded by Matthew Cauble, cofounder of Silicon Valley meal replacement startup Soylent and Jen Batchelor, who serves as CEO. It has already attracted venture capital firms including Canaan Partners, Refactor Capital, Weekend Fund, and Fifty Years, which aims to invest in companies using business to solve the world's biggest problems. The company declined to disclose how much funding it has received.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Sober curiosity is a real thing,"" Batchelor told CNN Business.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Batchelor says Kin is trying to create more options for consumers. A lot of people feel their choices are to either go out and drink alcohol, or stay home alone. ""If those are the two choices, then something is broken,"" she said. ""You can do the 'feel good' thing and still be out at a bar, still take a client out.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The company is slated to release its second product later this month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Tech's complicated relationship with alcohol</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While it's investing in new alcohol-free companies, Silicon Valley is also reexamining its own relationship with alcohol. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alcohol has been <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/31/tech/wework-beer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">one of the perks</a> associated with tech and startup cultures over the years, with young companies embracing the idea of hustling hard, but also bonding over a drink, or several, with colleagues. Inevitably, the availability of alcohol in offices has come under scrutiny when companies run into unflattering alcohol-fueled incidents. One of the more memorable ones: When HR services startup Zenefits <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2016/02/26/technology/zenefits-layoffs/index.html"" target=""_blank"">banned alcohol consumption</a> after reportedly finding cigarettes, beer cups and used condoms in the company's stairwell.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After coordinated walkouts by employees and contractors in November over its handling of sexual harassment accusations, Google announced a number of changes to its work culture, including cutting down on excessive drinking. ""Harassment is never acceptable and alcohol is never an excuse. But one of the most common factors among the harassment complaints made today at Google is that the perpetrator had been drinking (~20% of cases),"" the company said, <a href=""http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/november_announcement.pdf"" target=""_blank"">adding that leaders</a> will be charged with discouraging workers from excessive drinking. Some teams limit workers to two drinks per event.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">WeWork, the co-working community behemoth, said <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/31/tech/wework-beer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">last October </a>that it was exploring curbing beer consumption in some of its New York City locations, limiting members to four 12-ounce glasses of beer per day. WeWork previously offered an unlimited beer on tap as a perk to people renting its co-working spaces. The company's own corporate culture and the prevalence of alcohol at company events has been called into question by an ongoing lawsuit from a former employee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Making not drinking hip</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kin isn't the only new brand trying to lessen the stigma of drinking a non-alcoholic beverage that is getting attention from startup investors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last month, <a href=""https://liquiddeath.com/"" target=""_blank"">Liquid Death</a> made waves when it launched. The startup applies the bold marketing of energy drinks to a water-in-a-can beverage. Its tagline is ""Murder Your Thirst.""  Like an alcohol brand, it has an age gate on its website that says, ""This water may give nightmares to persons under 18 years of age."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The idea is to make consumers look cool while they keep hydrated, and to the unsuspecting eye, one may never know they're downing simple H2O.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The original impetus, according to CEO and co-founder Mike Cessario, was to cater to heavy metal and punk rock fans. But the ability to drink water out of a can (which is more ecofriendly than plastic) and look like you're drinking a beer or an energy drink, has broader appeal.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It has already raised $1.6 million dollars from investors including Science, an incubator and tech studio that's <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/interactive/technology/15-questions-with-mike-jones/index.html"" target=""_blank"">backed</a> companies like Dollar Shave Club.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Science partner Mike Jones, who lives in Los Angeles, told CNN Business that he made a choice many years ago not to drink alcohol. ""There's many people in my circle that have chosen to not drink and chosen to be selective about what they put in their bodies,"" said Jones. ""We're seeing a consciousness around it more and more."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As for Kan, he says its difficult for him to unpack why now he is seeing a growing number of people similarly giving up on drinking.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Is it part of aging (Kan is now 35 — in a very different life stage than his early years in Silicon Valley more than a decade ago)? A tech industry thing where engineers are constantly tweaking and iterating on themselves? Or, is it something broader, he mused on a recent phone call. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Whatever it is, Kan, who also invests in startups, says he's not particularly bullish that no-alcohol alternatives will takeover. He said it's ""very unlikely"" alcohol will get replaced on a broad scale. ""I have a hard time seeing it disappear from the American zeitgeist.""  </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Sam Walton stationed Walmart's headquarters in Bentonville nearly five decades ago and the retailer's footprint is on display throughout the town.

Plastic and paper bags are available only for a fee. And at checkout, cashiers hurry shoppers away, expecting them to bag their own groceries in a separate location away from the cash register. These tactics help Aldi drive labor costs down. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Despite those minor inconveniences for customers, Aldi seems to be gaining traction in Bentonville. ""The store is in a very convenient location with high foot-traffic volume in a part of northwest Arkansas that is growing considerably. It is very strategic,"" said Sodero.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walmart executives are taking Aldi seriously and have lowered prices in some markets to counter Aldi.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On a visit inside Walmart headquarters this week, Aldi was one of the brands listed on a sign about where budget-conscious customers shop, along with Walmart, Family Dollar and Dollar General. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Aldi is not only winning low-income customers. Aldi has attracted wealthier shoppers looking to save on their grocery bills. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I never underestimate them,"" Walmart US chief Greg Foran said at a retail industry conference in March. ""I've been competing against Aldi for 20-plus years.

""We track them closely.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About 40 people — including one woman carrying a blue Walmart Museum tote bag— were shopping for groceries on a visit to Aldi in Bentonville Thursday evening in the middle of Walmart's annual shareholder week.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Vegetables and fruit greet customers when they enter the low-ceiling store with tiled gray floors. From there, Aldi has a few wide aisles stocked with packaged foods and canned soups displayed in their original cardboard shipping boxes to save employees time stocking shelves.

And on this week's episode I go to a bunch of Black People Meetings (and one ""people of color"" meeting) in a place that has been designed and governed to have a lot of them: Milwaukee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why Milwaukee? Because Milwaukee regularly comes up No. 1 on lists of America's most segregated cities.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If that surprises you, you are not alone. Most people who don't know Milwaukee have no idea it is one of America's blackest major cities. Milwaukee <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/03/05/390723644/why-is-milwaukee-so-bad-for-black-people"" target=""_blank"">is 40% black</a>, which makes it blacker than <a href=""http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/chicago-population/"" target=""_blank"">Chicago</a>, <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-blacks-latinos-south-la-20170228-story.html"" target=""_blank"">Compton</a>, and <a href=""http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/oakland-population/"" target=""_blank"">Oakland, California</a>, where I live. And as I learned from the people I met there, the racism felt in Milwaukee extends into the suburbs and throughout the entire state of Wisconsin.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Imagine being a black person, living in Wisconsin (a state that is so racist that you refer to it as <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/television-radio/2019/05/07/cnns-united-shades-america-w-kamau-bell-air-show-race-milwaukee/3662625002/"" target=""_blank"">""Wississippi""</a>), and when you tell people who live outside of the state they often say, ""THERE ARE BLACK PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN?"" It's something like screaming, ""HELP MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE!"" and the fire department says, ""You own a house?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Milwaukee is often noted as the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/12/17/black-white-segregation-edges-downward-since-2000-census-shows/"" target=""_blank"">most segregated city in the country</a> because it has the highest number of neighborhoods that are clearly separated by race. Milwaukee also has all of the issues that come along with segregation, including <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/01/24/milwaukee-police-officers-accused-brutality-cover-up/2657080002/"" target=""_blank"">police violence</a>, high rates of <a href=""https://www.wuwm.com/topic/project-milwaukee-black-men-prison#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">incarceration</a> and <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/tv/2019/06/07/usoa-405-ron-1.cnn.html"" target=""_blank"">disproportionate</a> <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2018/04/11/school-to-prison-pipeline-milwaukee/"" target=""_blank"">disciplinary action against students of color</a>. The setting of the TV show ""Happy Days"" and the home of the American institution of Harley Davidson is also home to a lot of structural and institutional racism.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To learn more about all this, I started by meeting with two experts: historian <a href=""https://www.wuwm.com/post/reggie-jackson-milwaukee-segregation-americas-black-holocaust-museum#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">Reggie Jackson</a> in Sherman Park and professor <a href=""https://syreetamcfadden.com/"" target=""_blank"">Syreeta McFadden</a> at the best-named coffee shop ever, ""Coffee Makes You Black.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reggie shares the story of the 2016 killing of 23-year-old <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/21/us/milwaukee-heaggan-brown-shooting-trial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Sylville Smith</a> and the protest that erupted in Sherman Park near the site of the shooting. (We also rolled up to our meeting with Reggie <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/television-radio/2019/05/07/cnns-united-shades-america-w-kamau-bell-air-show-race-milwaukee/3662625002/"" target=""_blank"">as the cops were rolling up on a group of black people</a>. A white woman had called the cops because the black people were handing out Halloween candy in late October without a permit ... and no, you don't need a permit for that.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Syreeta breaks down the effects of the discriminatory home loan practices known as <a href=""https://www.wiscontext.org/how-redlining-continues-shape-racial-segregation-milwaukee"" target=""_blank"">redlining</a>, which drew lines and zones on city maps where black people could and couldn't live. We did a deep dive about racism in our brief time together. And as we were editing the show, I realized that we had never actually defined racism on previous episodes. So this time, we did.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In my experience, most people define racism as simply hating someone because of their skin color.  Occasionally, I -- incorrectly -- use that definition, too. But every anti-racist activist and academic I know believes that treating someone poorly because of their skin color is actually just prejudice. Racism requires prejudice plus power.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because this country was founded in large part through the genocide of the indigenous people of this land and then largely built on the free labor of enslaved Africans, prejudice is embedded in all of America's structures and institutions. That's how prejudice gets its power and becomes racism. That's why you can't just hire black police officers and expect the whole institution of policing not to be still packed with racism. And white folks, if that's making your head swim right now, imagine all of that going through your head every time you apply for a job, talk to a police officer or simply walk outdoors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While undoing all of this might seem way too big and daunting a task, there are still lots of people in Milwaukee working hard to dismantle structural racism. <a href=""https://uwm.edu/sce/instructors/monique-liston-ph-d/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Monique Liston</a>, for example, is teaching anti-racist workshops through her learning organization, Ubuntu Research and Evaluation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Harvard-educated entrepreneur <a href=""https://www.biztimes.com/2019/industries/arts-entertainment-sports/lisa-caesar/"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Caesar</a> and her brother, John Ridley -- yup, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""12 Years a Slave"" -- are fighting brain drain in Milwaukee through an artist's collective they have founded called No Studios.  It aims to help people's showbiz dreams come true without people having to leave Milwaukee. I also had some pizza with young activists from L.I.T., which stands for <a href=""https://www.litmke.org/"" target=""_blank"">Leaders Igniting Transformation</a>. They are a group who help students of color navigate a school system that too often sees them as statistics and not individuals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One of my meetings in Milwaukee was an inside job. Since I am what I like to call the ACLU's Celebrity Ambassador of Racial Justice, the ACLU set me up with their Wisconsin chapter, where I talked with <a href=""http://aclu-wi.org/sites/default/files/issue/pdf/CollinsVMilwaukeeComplaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">plaintiffs</a> Gregory Chambers, Stephen Jansen and Wisconsin state representative <a href=""https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1811"" target=""_blank"">David Crowley</a>. Chambers and Jansen recently <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/07/11/628020991/milwaukee-council-oks-3-4-million-settlement-of-police-stop-and-frisk-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">won</a> an important case against the Milwaukee Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I was even lucky enough to speak with Maria Hamilton about her powerful work with <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/united-by-death-mothers-of-the-movement-breathes-new-l-1833791229"" target=""_blank"">Mothers of the Movement</a> and <a href=""https://www.mothersforjusticeunited.org/"" target=""_blank"">Mothers for Justice United</a>. In 2014 Maria's son, <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2019/04/27/hundreds-gather-celebrate-life-dontre-hamilton/3602139002/"" target=""_blank"">Dontre Hamilton</a>, was waiting for his brother on a park bench when he was killed by Milwaukee police officer <a href=""https://www.wisn.com/article/raw-chief-flynn-terminates-officer-who-shot-dontre-hamilton/5971830"" target=""_blank"">Christopher Manney</a>, after a manager at the nearby Starbucks called the cops.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the wake of Dontre's death, Maria joined forces with the mothers of Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Michael Brown, Hadiya Pendleton, Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice to form Mothers of the Movement as a way to support each other and fight for police reform. Maria also started her own group, Mothers for Justice United, to help all of the moms whose families have been devastated by police violence. The fact that we even need these groups is an indictment of our country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I ended my series of black people meetings and POC meetings in Milwaukee with a special lesson from professor <a href=""https://www.johnbdiamond.com/about.html"" target=""_blank"">John Diamond</a>, an expert on implicit bias. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/tv/2019/06/07/usoa-405-ron-4.cnn.html"" target=""_blank"">Implicit bias</a> is a term that describes the way our brains are affected by growing up within systems that enact oppression. You'll learn all about it if you watch the show and you'll get to see me take a test that measures how biased I am.  You'll also see that I give everyone in the audience a homework assignment -- to take an implicit bias test, easily available online thanks to <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html"" target=""_blank"">Project Implicit</a>, an international research collaboration founded in 1998 by scientists at Harvard, UVA and University of Washington. Everyone should take one. Whether you think you're biased or not, racism is a part of your life. It's in the air we breathe. But if we measure our bias, hopefully we can dismantle it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So this week, welcome to the Black People meeting! But white folks, please don't bring <a href=""https://variety.com/video/chadwick-boseman-snl-potato-salad-joke/"" target=""_blank"">your potato salad with the raisins in it</a>.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""Questions about her death and the care she has received are understandable, but can only be answered once the facts have been established.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So why did so many media outlets get it wrong?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Media's misreporting</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Much has already been written about the failure of the media to do its due diligence in telling Pothoven's story.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Politico Europe reporter Naomi O'Leary, one of the first English-language journalists to get the facts straight, laid out the details of Pothoven's case in a Twitter thread on Wednesday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A 17-year-old rape victim was NOT euthanised in the Netherlands"" O'Leary tweeted. ""It took me about 10 mins to check with the reporter who wrote the original Dutch story.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After she called out the outlets who had misreported the story, many began to tweak headlines and change copy, some without issuing corrections.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2019/06/why-international-newspapers-reported-the-death-of-noa-pothoven-as-euthanasia-when-it-wasnt/"" target=""_blank"">According to a Dutch news report</a>, many British news outlets were initially alerted to the story by Central European News (CEN), a newswire service that specializes in foreign tabloid stories. CEN has previously been accused of providing unreliable information to clients, an accusation CEN fervently denies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Michael Leidig, who runs the agency, told CNN that when it became clear CEN's original report mischaracterized Pothoven's death, they published a new story describing the way she ended her life as a ""legal gray zone.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Dyck Bosscher, a spokesman for the Dutch Voluntary Termination of Life Association (NVVE), which established Levenseinde, the end-of-life clinic where Pothoven sought out assisted suicide, said this case was clear-cut -- she did not die by euthanasia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is a lot of misunderstanding about our legislation around euthanasia,"" Bosscher told CNN. ""The media reports make it seem as if it is easy to get euthanasia in the Netherlands, but it's not the truth.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are strictly defined as ""the active termination of life at a patient's voluntary and well-informed request,"" according to <a href=""https://www.knmg.nl/actualiteit-opinie/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/euthanasia-in-the-netherlands.htm"" target=""_blank"">the Royal Dutch Medical Association</a>; both were legalized in the country in 2002. <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/euthanasia/euthanasia-assisted-suicide-and-non-resuscitation-on-request"" target=""_blank"">According to Dutch law</a>, patients as young as 12 may request and receive euthanasia with parental consent. For those age 16 and 17, parents must be aware of the request.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bosscher explained that gaining approval was a complex, lengthy process under the criteria set out by Dutch law. Over the course of multiple interviews, those seeking euthanasia must convince a doctor that their request is voluntary, they are suffering unbearably, have exhausted all alternative options and are capable of understanding the weight of their decision, he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, in cases like Pothoven's, when the patient is living with mental illness, the application is even more difficult, because the burden of proof is so high.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of the patients who are approved to receive euthanasia by the Levenseinde clinic, <a href=""https://www.levenseindekliniek.nl/en/facts-figures/"" target=""_blank"">only 9% are psychiatric patients</a>. The rest are living with cancer or another disease.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last December, Pothoven told Dutch newspaper <a href=""https://www.gelderlander.nl/home/noa-16-uit-arnhem-is-nu-al-klaar-met-haar-verwoeste-leven~a01a7bd1/"" target=""_blank"">the Gelderlander</a> that she was devastated to be denied euthanasia by the clinic. ""They are of the opinion that I am too young to die. They believe I need to receive trauma focused treatment first and wait until my brain is fully developed. That won't happen until I am 21. I am devastated because I cannot wait that long,"" she said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Ethics of euthanasia</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While inaccurate reports about Pothoven's death spread from Australia to the United States, the story also fueled a long-running debate over the ethics of euthanasia -- particularly in Italy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">#NoaPothoven began trending on Italian Twitter and even grabbed the attention of the Pope, who appeared to refer to the case in a subtweet.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all,"" Pope Francis posted on Twitter. ""We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And after major Italian outlets like la Repubblica, Corriere della Sera, ANSA and AGI misreported that Pothaven was euthanised, far-right politician Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy party declared that Pothoven's death was ""a defeat of an entire civilization that has stopped defending life.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was only after Italian politician Marco Cappato, a former member of European Parliament who has campaigned for legal euthanasia in Italy, cited local Dutch media to debunk the reports, that some Italian media outlets issued a correction.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bioethicists say confusion around the definition of euthanasia helps fuel misinformation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is genuine confusion about what constitutes euthanasia and it's quite tempting to conflate it with the withdrawal of treatment,"" Iain Brassington, a bioethicist and senior lecturer at the University of Manchester in northern England, told CNN. ""What's crucial is the intention.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brassington, whose research centers on autonomy and euthanasia, said reporting on assisted dying can quickly become emotive and polarized. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those two things together -- polarizing content that elicits an emotional response -- are key ingredients in the spread of misinformation.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And the consequences of false reporting in places like Italy can have wide-ranging effects on passing end-of-life care legislation elsewhere.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NVVE's spokesman Dyck Bosscher told CNN, in Italy false stories like this regarding euthanasia serve to, ""warn people that they should never have this liberal legislation ... to underline that this is a slippery slope.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Philip Nitschke, an Australian activist and founder of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, said that while the false story was being touted by the religious right, and others who are against euthanasia, it had also provided a rare opportunity to discuss the issue on a global level.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What you see is a whole spectrum of opinions from those who believe it is never right to give away your life, and I imagine the Pope falls into that category, through to those who see it as a human right, to be able to decide when and how to give away your life,"" Nitschke, whose offices are based in Amsterdam, told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's quite a good thing to open up the debate.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>For support outside of the US, a worldwide directory of resources and international hotlines is provided by the </em><a href=""https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/"" target=""_blank""><em>International Association for Suicide Prevention</em></a><em>.

She had studied Arabic in Egypt, worked with abandoned children in Yemen and traveled to remote villages in Indonesia to advocate for indigenous women. Her family said she had always dreamed of visiting Peru, but she hadn't gotten the chance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When her friend, Alicia Garcia Steele, told her she was going to travel to Lima to be the maid of honor at a wedding, Carla jumped at the opportunity to go with her. Carla's mom helped her pick out a navy blue dress and a pair of beige ballerina flats for the wedding.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After taking a bus and two plane rides from Detroit, Carla and Garcia Steele arrived in the bustling capital of Lima just in time to help with last-minute wedding details. They would later dance all night at the reception and celebrate Carla's birthday on the beach. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the last stretch of their two-week trip, Carla planned to travel alone to hike Machu Picchu, even after her friend advised her not to go by herself.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The day Carla left for her Machu Picchu trip, Garcia Steele grew nervous and kept texting her as the hours passed. She provided CNN with screengrabs of the messages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla are you there?""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla I'm so worried and have not heard anything from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Is everything ok?!?!""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Please please please write me when you can.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla. How are you. I'm dying to hear from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla replied -- more than 12 hours later -- she apologized, blaming the lack of Wi-Fi and her packed travel itinerary. Garcia Steele was glad to hear that Carla was OK, but something else in that text alarmed her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""I had a big issue that I need to resolve that I'll do it before I get home,""</em> Carla wrote. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This was one of the last times Garcia Steele would hear from her.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her friends and relatives were unable to reach her for a few days. They didn't panic until Carla missed her flight back to the United States.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her mom had just moved cross-country for her</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria, 66, had been living in Detroit for only a few months when Carla traveled to Peru. When Maria retired from her job as a victims' advocate for the Kendall County District Attorney in Texas, Carla asked her mom to move in with her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria suspected her daughter's eyesight was worsening. Carla suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that causes a person's vision to deteriorate over time. After she was diagnosed at age 10, her mother pushed her to learn Braille and other skills that would prepare her to be fully blind. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla became very independent, living by herself, walking and biking around the city. She rarely talked about her blindness, and it was even more unusual for her to ask her mom for help. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within weeks of moving to Detroit to be with her daughter, Maria had learned all aspects of Carla's busy schedule: Her 6 a.m. trips to the gym, her work shift as a docent at the Arab American National Museum, the English as a Second Language classes she taught at a community center. Carla would write her plans on a whiteboard hanging in the entryway of their home, and if something changed, Carla would call her mom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's excitement about visiting Machu Picchu was palpable in her texts and the sound of her voice.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'll be thinking about you when I'm there,"" Maria remembered her daughter telling her during their last phone call on December 10.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A seasoned traveler quietly vanishes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After the wedding, Carla joined a group of Spanish and Argentinian travelers to hike Huayna Picchu, the steep mountain overlooking the famed ruins, and they returned together to Cusco a few hours later. The group -- still feeling the adrenaline rush -- had dinner together and danced for hours at a club before finally settling at a hostel for the night. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I can't wait to tell you all about it. It was absolutely worth 100%,"" she wrote to Garcia Steele in her last message to her on the night of December 11.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While her newfound friends were still asleep the next morning, her family said, a surveillance camera caught Carla taking a cab by herself outside the hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She didn't share her plans with anyone, her family said, but there is no doubt that she planned to come back. Before leaving, she sent a message to a friend saying she would be back in a few hours to hopefully visit some museums. She also left behind two bags with souvenirs, her medicine and her jacket.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later police would learn that she had taken two cabs. The first driver dropped Carla off at a Cusco street where people ride shared taxis headed to the Sacred Valley. The other driver said Carla was in his collective taxi and that she got off in the valley's first village -- Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>He left Texas behind to search the Peruvian Andes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father had been replacing the windows of an old home in Comfort, Texas, when he learned his daughter was missing -- three days after she was last seen. He booked a flight to Peru and drove 40 miles to the San Antonio airport to catch an eight-hour flight to Lima. From there, he flew over an hour to Cusco, and a police escort drove him for 40 minutes to Pisac through the curvy mountain roads of the Sacred Valley.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When he arrived in Pisac, he quickly learned that locals don't trust police. He spent days getting to know the residents of the town, and the people who regularly sell handcrafts in the main square and outside the park's entrance. They were and are still cordial with him, but he's not sure if they will ever trust him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has really been a nightmare since the beginning, a total nightmare,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He walked through the narrow cobbled streets of the colonial village looking for surveillance cameras, only to find a handful. Magnifying his exasperation, most of those cameras erase their footage every five days or so. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It had taken police more than a week to track down the information about the cab drivers who had taken her on the journey to Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What happened to Carla?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A camera outside a drugstore in Pisac captured the last known image of Carla. It shows her walking quickly with her green daypack and her silver folding cane for 14 seconds, about an hour after she left her hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She was heading in the direction of the Pisac Archaeological Park, a 9,063-hectare (22,395 acre) mountainside historic site known for its Incan ruins, tunnels, and massive agricultural terraces. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla's dad walked around the village's main square asking about his daughter, a woman selling traditional clothing and an employee of the local tourism information office said Carla had asked them for directions to the park. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A park employee later told police he saw Carla walking toward the entrance, but the park's ticket-taker couldn't confirm that. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, police pursued the theory that something had happened to Carla in the park, and that someone had hidden her body, or wild animals had devoured it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They flew drones over the park, sent in cadaver dogs and rescue teams, but they found nothing, said Peru National Police Colonel Carlos Manuel Valer Cruces, the man leading the investigation into Carla's disappearance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A team of Peruvian police detectives that handle missing persons and homicide cases are currently working together to find Carla, along with a special prosecutor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police now believe that Carla never made it into the park. They believe someone took or lured her to one of the many ritual sites in the region where tourists try an intensely hallucinogenic -- and sometimes deadly -- potion known as ayahuasca. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's family disputes that she would have wanted to take drugs. They believe Carla was sexually assaulted, kidnapped or was the victim of either human or organ trafficking. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I have no doubt in my mind that my sister was the victim of a crime,"" her brother said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Looking for his sister became his second job</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. and Carla -- born 11 months apart -- had the same friends growing up, went to the same schools in Texas and spent hours tubing on the Guadalupe River, talking about their future.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As his dad flew to Peru to search for his sister, Carlos studied maps of the Cusco region and answered dozens of phone calls from people reporting sightings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are not sleeping, you are not eating, you are not showering. You are just working constantly,"" Carlos Jr., 34, said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He can't leave his wife and months-old son -- or his job at a design fabrication studio -- indefinitely, but he has traveled to Peru from his home in Brooklyn, New York, at least three times, staying for weeks at a time to help his dad. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It just never feels like it's enough,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It makes you feel rotten inside that you can't grieve, you can't cry, you can't--"" he said, sobbing. ""You can't be there for your son, for your wife, because you have to do the job of the police.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She's not the only one missing</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An ocean away from the Valpeoz family, a woman heard about Carla's disappearance and burst into tears. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alexandra Ayala Leon, who lives in Seville, Spain, had never met Carla or anyone who knew her. But her own daughter had vanished in the same region of Peru, nearly a year before. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two men were arrested a few weeks after 28-year-old Nathaly Salazar Ayala went missing. They claimed she had died in a zip line accident and that they dumped her body in a river, yet her body has never been located.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ayala Leon felt helpless knowing another family was living through the same nightmare.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would not want them to suffer the same pain. Unfortunately, they're going through the same (situations) we experienced,"" said Ayala Leon, 49.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In long phone conversations with the Valpeoz family, Ayala Leon has guided them while they navigate through red tape, deal with calls from shamans looking to take advantage of them and look for experts to help in Carla's search. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She and Alisa Clamen of Canada, whose 22-year-old son, Jesse Galganov, disappeared while backpacking in the Peruvian mountains in 2017, have become like a second family for Carla's brother. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The pain is the same, different circumstances, but the pain is still there,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""I could never repay them for the amount of love, support and information that they've given me.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her family feels abandoned</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. has spent countless hours asking US politicians and the State Department to get more involved in finding his sister.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A lot of times it's really, really tough to get somebody on the other side of the line,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""Sometimes I have to wait days to get a phone call back.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""My family feels like we are just being abandoned,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US Embassy officials continue telling the family they don't have jurisdiction in Peru to search for Carla. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A State Department spokesperson declined to discuss Carla's case, citing privacy considerations, and said the agency was ""aware of media reports of a US citizen missing in Cusco."" The spokesperson also referred all inquiries on the investigation to Peruvian authorities. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When a US citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts. The US Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater responsibility than the protection of US citizens overseas,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father walks every other day to the police station in Cusco, trying to make sure Peruvian authorities are actively searching for his daughter. He's shared potential sightings and other tips from locals, but he can't be sure if detectives will act on them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Valer Cruces, the man leading the police investigation, said that US authorities have not offered local police any specific assistance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Their lives are changed forever</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Soon after Carla disappeared, Maria realized she couldn't stay in Detroit. She started to notice that everywhere she went -- the bank, the supermarket -- people recognized her and they stared at her with sadness. And she imagined she saw her daughter everywhere -- standing at every bus stop, walking on the streets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A few days after Christmas, she packed a small bag and traveled to Brooklyn. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, Maria fell asleep every night on the pink couch in her son's apartment, holding her daughter's grey knit sweater. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She can't find Carla herself, she said, but she can support her son and her husband while they look for her. She spends her days making baby purees from scratch and playing with her grandson. She has been paying off Carla's student loans and other bills, and recently had to go through Carla's possessions alone in preparation for selling her house.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now she's waiting for Carla in a small Brooklyn apartment that her son secured for her. Near her bed, she keeps a pocket-sized velvet picture frame with childhood photos of her children, alongside an image of the Virgin Mary.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since Carla disappeared, Carlos Jr. has celebrated his wife's birthday, takes any chance he gets to play with his son, and has started a new tradition with his mom: they'll stop by their neighborhood diner to eat cheeseburgers once a week.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm really trying to fill my life with things to do with my family,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""But at the end, I'm always thinking about Carla, the investigation, my dad, my mom. I can't escape it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands of miles away, Carlos Sr. wakes up every morning before sunrise ready to keep searching for Carla. He doesn't mind wearing the same few changes of clothes for weeks, the sickening altitude or the brutal sun. He'll be right there, far from home and alone, whether someone breaks their silence and calls police, whether his daughter's remains are found, or his prayers are answered and he is able to hug his daughter one more time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I need to take my daughter back,"" Valpeoz said. ""I need to find her somehow.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Two of the three girls were 6-year-old Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, both daughters of Honeychurch.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was an answer to a question that had remained <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/new-hampshire-cold-case-homicides/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a mystery for decades</a>. Authorities on Thursday said the breakthrough was a result of information from relatives, DNA testing, genealogy research — and the diligent research of Heath. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her first lead didn't go anywhere</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In January 2017, investigators announced that a man named Bob Evans had likely killed the four female victims discovered in Bear Brook State Park. In August of that year, they announced that ""Bob Evans"" was an alias for Terrence ""Terry"" Rasmussen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasmussen went by many names over the years. He was linked to the 1981 disappearance of a woman in New Hampshire that he was thought to be dating and was serving time for the murder of his wife in California when he died of natural causes in 2010.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though investigators had identified Rasmussen as the man who likely killed the four Bear Brook victims in 2017, the victims' identities were still a mystery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For years, helping connect people to their missing loved ones had been a hobby of Heath's. Combined with her interest in the Rasmussen case, she got to work on trying to find potential matches for the victims in November 2017. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She scoured ancestry message boards for terms like ""California,"" where Rasmussen had been arrested, or ""missing sister"" in hopes of finding a relative of the victims. Then she began compiling a list of names. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would just go through that list and then I would start searching to see if they had public records, if the person was alive, see if I could find any record for their existence,"" Heath said. ""If not, then I would pursue it a little further and reach out to the person who had originally posted looking for the loved ones.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath said she found a posting from around 1999 about a relative looking for Sarah McWaters and her mother Marlyse McWaters. As she conducted further searches for Marlyse McWaters, Heath came across other relatives looking for the same woman. It turned out McWaters was also the mother of a girl named Marie Vaughn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a Facebook group about the Rasmussen case, Heath asked whether those missing people could be the victims found in Allenstown, but she didn't get much of a response. So, she dropped it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She followed up a year later</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About a year later, Heath, who lives in Connecticut, was listening to a New Hampshire Public Radio podcast about the Bear Brook murders when information about the victims reminded her again of the woman looking for Sarah McWaters on that ancestry message board. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At that point I was like, I need to reach out to this woman,"" Heath said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The listing contained an email address, so Heath said she tried to match the address to a Facebook profile. Heath reached out to one woman asking whether she was the same person who had made the ancestry posting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes, Heath received a response. It was her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath asked the relative if she had any more information about Sarah and Marlyse McWaters. The woman started sharing more details, including that Marlyse had married a man with the last name Rasmussen. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Right there, my stomach jumped,"" Heath said. ""It just rocked. I knew right away. There's no way that a woman goes missing with those children with a guy with that last name, Rasmussen. It's just way too coincidental.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath didn't say anything to the relative of Sarah McWaters about Rasmussen's criminal history just yet, but she said she began reaching out to relatives of Marie Vaughn. Vaughn's relatives told Heath that Vaughn's mother had left California with a man named Terry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>It all came together in the same week</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within two hours, Heath said she was on the phone with law enforcement in San Bernardino, California. Those authorities quickly turned the information over to investigators in New Hampshire who were already examining DNA research based on information from the family of Marie Vaughn and other genetic databases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through advances in DNA technology, investigators were able to obtain DNA profiles of the degraded remains from the barrels. Barbara Rae-Venter, a genetic genealogist who also helped crack the Golden State Killer case, was able to confirm the identities of the victims via searches through DNA databases, according to New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That, plus the information that came in from Heath and the DNA samples from Sarah McWaters' family, allowed them to make the final determination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Her work and our work converged, and it turns out that she was correct,"" Strelzin told CNN.

158,How a Utah assault case upended the DNA website that caught the Golden State Killer,"Curtis Rogers, the founder of the free DNA website GEDMatch, wanted to do all he could to help police solve a disturbing assault case out of Utah.",/2019/05/27/us/genetic-genealogy-gedmatch-privacy/index.html,,,//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170628093754-cnn-world-rugby-bryan-habana-dnafit-rugby-spc-00013322-small-11.jpg,2019-06-09,2019,6,9,9,50,6,us,"[<div class=""el__leafmedia el__leafmedia--sourced-paragraph""><p class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""><cite class=""el-editorial-source""> (CNN)</cite>Curtis Rogers, the founder of the free DNA website GEDMatch, wanted to do all he could to help police solve a disturbing assault case out of Utah.</p></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""><cite class=""el-editorial-source""> (CNN)</cite>Curtis Rogers, the founder of the free DNA website GEDMatch, wanted to do all he could to help police solve a disturbing assault case out of Utah.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">He knew his website, full of more than 1.2 million completed<strong> </strong>DNA kits, could help. After all, it had helped solve the so-called Golden State Killer case last April through a new forensic technique known as genetic genealogy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">But there was one problem: GEDMatch's own terms of service didn't allow police to use the site for this Utah assault case. The terms assured users who submitted DNA kits that police would only use their information to solve violent crimes of murder and rape. But not assaults.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, Rogers decided to make an exception in this case, given its severity, and help police. That exception led to an arrest in the case, yes, but it also sparked a fierce privacy backlash. And that criticism, in turn, led GEDMatch to make changes to the site that have sharply curtailed police ability to catch criminals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We can be sure there are hundreds of cases that would have been solved in the coming months or year that very well won't be now,"" CeCe Moore, a leading investigative genetic genealogist who worked on the Utah assault case, told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People will die,"" she added. ""It sounds dramatic but it's actually true.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The issue highlights the privacy concerns around home DNA technology and its use by police to solve cold cases, a field that has exploded since <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/us/golden-state-killer-development/index.html"" target=""_blank"">GEDMatch was used to catch the alleged Golden State Killer </a>last year. With the technology, police work with genetic genealogists to put a suspect's DNA into GEDMatch in hopes of finding the suspect's family members.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But that work will be more difficult on GEDMatch now. In the wake of the backlash, Rogers and his partner John Olson made it so that all GEDMatch users are automatically made to be unsearchable by law enforcement. Users can choose to opt-in to law enforcement searches if they consent, or they can remain unsearchable.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rogers, an 81-year-old genealogy hobbyist, said that was the best balance between helping police arrest criminals and protecting privacy rights.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Certainly there was a short-term loss but I think this is going to make us stronger,"" he told CNN. ""Stronger ethically (and) stronger for support among people who put their information on our site. I think it's the right step to make.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The rise of GEDMatch in solving cases</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Led by companies like Ancestry and 23AndMe, direct-to-consumer DNA technology spread as a way to learn about one's family history by spitting into a tube. More than 1.2 million DNA kits have been uploaded to GEDMatch, a free website, by people who want to better learn about their genetics or connect with family members.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The power of genetic genealogy in the hands of police was made clear when it was used to arrest Joseph James DeAngelo, an elderly ex-cop, as the<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/25/us/golden-state-killer-development/index.html"" target=""_blank""> Golden State Killer</a> last April. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Typically in these cases, police work with a trained genetic genealogist to put an unknown suspect's DNA into GEDMatch, which then produces a list of people related to the suspect. Genetic genealogists then build out a family tree from this information to try to identify possible people who fit the suspect profile, and police use those as leads.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The technique has helped police identify serial killers, murderers and rapists from decades ago. Parabon NanoLabs, the DNA technology company leading the way in working with police, <a href=""https://parabon-nanolabs.com/news-events/2019/05/parabon-customers-net-55-solved-cases-in-first-year-of-snapshot-genetic-genealogy-service.html"" target=""_blank"">touted earlier this month</a> that its genetic genealogy services have helped law enforcement solve 55 cases in the past year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moore, chief genetic genealogist at Parabon, told CNN last year that GEDMatch was vital to this work.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""GEDMatch is absolutely the key, and had (the founders) decided that they didn't want law enforcement to use their database, we wouldn't have been able to do this,"" she told CNN at the time.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/11/health/genetic-privacy-study/index.html"" target=""_blank"">study released in October found</a> that more than 60% of people with European ancestry can be identified by an anonymous DNA sample, simply by using data from consumer genetic databases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>Utah assault case solved with milk container</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This fierce debate stems from an attack last November in Centerville, Utah. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There, an unknown suspect broke into a locked church and strangled a 71-year-old woman who was alone practicing the organ, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cpd.ut/photos/a.396583827058941/2412696985447605/?type=1&amp;theater"" target=""_blank"">Centerville Police said</a>. The woman survived but was left with a webbing of broken blood vessels in her neck, and her eyes were black and blue, according to an affidavit for a search warrant. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The suspect had broken into the church by breaking a window, and detectives collected blood from the suspect left at the scene, the affidavit said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But that DNA had no matches in the FBI's national database, so the detectives contacted Parabon NanoLabs and Moore to take on the case, the warrant states.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moore said she initially declined to help because using GEDMatch to solve an assault case would violate the terms of service. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The police detective then made a personal plea to Rogers to make an exception in this case because of its seriousness, and Rogers agreed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I felt people's lives were in danger,"" he explained.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With Rogers' express permission, Moore and Parabon then carried out the genetic genealogy analysis through GEDMatch. The analysis found that a person's DNA kit on GEDMatch was likely a great uncle of the suspect, the affidavit said. That man had a nephew who lived in Centerville who had a 17-year-old son, so police began to investigate the teenager.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On April 11, a high school resource officer collected the teen's used juice box and plastic milk container from the garbage, the affidavit said. DNA testing on the milk container proved to be an exact match for the suspect's DNA, the affidavit said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The 17-year-old, who was not named, was booked into Farmington Bay Juvenile Detention Center on first degree aggravated burglary and second degree aggravated assault, police said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>Critics slam lack of informed consent</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Judy G. Russell, a trained genealogist with a legal degree who writes on her website about legal issues in genealogy, learned that GEDMatch had broken the terms of service, she wrote a fiery post revoking her recommendation for GEDMatch. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">GEDMatch's founders ""made a decision, on their own, without consulting their users, to expose the data of those users to the police because the police made a compelling argument,"" <a href=""https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/05/15/withdrawing-a-recommendation/"" target=""_blank"">she wrote</a>. ""Now it may very well be that the vast majority of those users would have agreed with that decision — if they had been asked. But they weren't asked.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She also said the site did not have the informed consent of its users to make an exception to the terms of service.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Bottom line: nobody but nobody can give informed consent for someone else,"" <a href=""https://www.legalgenealogist.com/2019/05/15/withdrawing-a-recommendation/"" target=""_blank"">Russell wrote</a>. ""Nobody but nobody has the right to make decisions for DNA testers other than the DNA testers.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Blaine Bettinger, a professional genealogist specializing in DNA evidence and author of the book ""Genetic Genealogy in Practice,"" wrote that informed consent of the users was necessary for an ethical and trustworthy DNA database.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We have a system in place that has spent the past 200-plus years in thousands of legal proceedings upholding the principal that the end does not justify the means if it exceeds the power of the government or erodes the privacy of the individual,"" <a href=""https://thegeneticgenealogist.com/2019/05/22/facing-dna-privacy-concerns-head-on/"" target=""_blank"">Bettinger wrote</a> on his blog ""The Genetic Genealogist."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, Moore, who has appeared as an expert on the PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" and is the chief genetic genealogist at Parabon NanoLabs, said this backlash was from a ""few very vocal influencers"" who blew this situation out of proportion.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I know we can't trample on people's civil liberties, but I don't think this rose to this level of seriousness,"" said Moore.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>Users now must opt-in to law enforcement searches</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rogers said he was convinced he saved people's lives with the exception in the assault case. But in considering the thorny ethical issue -- and the possibility of a damaging lawsuit -- he decided to make it so that everyone would have to opt-in to being searched by police.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We felt it was the right thing to do, the most ethical thing to do,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the same time, GEDMatch updated its terms of service to say that police are now allowed to use its DNA database to solve all violent crimes, including non-negligent manslaughter, aggravated assault and robbery cases. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We realized that our terms of service were too narrow. We have since expanded them so they basically are the same thing as FBI requirements for violent crimes,"" he said. ""We had to turn down other cases that were also violent crimes, but it was apparent that we really needed to expand somehow the terms of service.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">GEDMatch was useful partly because so many people were already in the database. Moore said that the opt-in change has ""crippled"" her team's ability to use GEDMatch and catch these killers and rapists.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This is shocking, it was so fast,"" Moore said. ""It was very much a rash decision in my opinion. (It was) not fully thought through.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For now, Parabon will continue to solve the cases in which they already completed the DNA analysis. But she said she was devastated for those families who might not get closure or who are still worried that a rapist or murderer won't be brought to justice.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's just incredibly sad for the victims, the families and society as a whole,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rogers said he wishes he had given more warning before the sudden change to the terms of service. He said about 20,000 people have opted in to being searched by police, and he encouraged more people to do so.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're the good guys,"" he said.

The rules allocate 90% of state delegate equivalents based on the results among those who caucus in-person, while 10% will be based on the results among those who caucus virtually, regardless of the actual number of people who choose to participate each way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the poll, 28% of those who say they are definitely or probably going to participate at this point say they are likely to do so virtually. Although Biden fares better among likely virtual participants (33%) than among likely in-person caucusgoers (23%), combining likely caucus participants' preferences according to the new rules does not move the numbers meaningfully for any candidate from what they would have been if the 90 to 10 ratio had not been applied. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But those rules could bring a slew of new people to the caucuses next February. Those who say they are likely to participate virtually are more likely to be first-time caucus attendees (52% vs. 17% of those who say they'll attend in-person), they are more apt to be registered as independents (31% vs. 11% among likely in-person attendees) and they are younger (63% under age 45 vs. 51% among in-person attendees).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Beyond Biden's lower overall support, the poll also suggests some warning signs for him beneath those numbers. His supporters are less apt than others to say they are ""extremely enthusiastic"" about him (29% vs. 39% for backers of all other candidates, and 43% among those backing his nearest competition in Sanders, Warren or Buttigieg). He also remains the best-known candidate in the field, suggesting he has less room to grow than other candidates who Iowa's Democratic caucusgoers are still getting to know.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The closer contest in Iowa also suggests a steeper challenge for 2016 runner-up Sanders than he faces elsewhere. In most national polling, he has held second place solo or been competitive with Biden, as he has in earlier Iowa surveys. In this poll, Sanders fares better with those who are less committed to showing up on caucus night. Among those who say they will probably attend in-person, he stands at 20%, while among those who say they are definite attenders, he's at 14%. That pattern holds among those who plan to attend virtually.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The results are also notable for the lack of traction by most of the 23-candidate field tested in the poll. The survey asked likely caucusgoers to name their first and second choice candidates, and then for each other candidate, asked whether the potential caucusgoer was ""actively considering"" that candidate, or not.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among likely in-person caucusgoers, only five candidates were in active consideration by a majority: Biden (61%), Warren (61%), Sanders (56%), Buttigieg (52%) and Harris (52%). The next closest candidates were under active consideration by about 4 in 10: Cory Booker at 43% and O'Rourke at 39%. Among potential virtual caucusgoers, the picture is similar. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's notable among both likely in-person and likely virtual caucusgoers is just how few are even considering some of the lower-tier candidates. Thirteen of the 23 tested candidates are under consideration by fewer than 2 in 10 in either group, that includes both candidates who have won election statewide (Jay Inslee, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock) as well as those who are making outsider bids for the nomination (Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Wayne Messam). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Outside of candidate preferences, about two-thirds of likely caucusgoers, regardless of how they plan to participate, say they would prefer that the winner in Iowa be someone with a strong chance of beating Trump over a candidate who shares their views on major issues. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when asked to choose among desirable qualities in a candidate, electability ranked fourth on a list of seven for both sets of possible caucus participants. A majority in both groups named integrity a top trait (56% among in-person, 61% among virtual), and 40% in each chose intelligence. Just over a third in each group picked leadership (34% in-person, 36% virtual) and about a quarter picked electability (25% in-person and 23% virtual). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likely Iowa caucusgoers are divided over how Democrats in Congress ought to handle the possibility of impeachment proceedings for Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About half of likely Iowa caucusgoers (48% regardless of how they plan to participate), say they think Democrats in Congress ought to continue investigating the President rather than move forward on formal impeachment proceedings now. Slightly fewer in each group say they think congressional Democrats would be shirking their constitutional duty if they do not move ahead on impeachment as soon as possible (42% among in-person, 45% among virtual).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When asked by reporters in Iowa Saturday night about the poll's numbers, Buttigieg said it was ""encouraging,"" but still ""early"" in the race.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Well, I'd say it's very encouraging. It shows a lot of momentum and it shows that campaigning works. We've invested a lot of time and a lot of effort, not just nationally, but getting to be known in Iowa and obviously that's led to some growth,"" he said. ""But it's very early. As you can see, it's a big field, a lot of jostling. There will be a lot of ups and downs. So one more encouraging data point, but a part of a very, very long road.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pete d'Alessandro, a senior Iowa adviser to Sanders' campaign, said his candidate's push was happening due to their appeal to new, young voters.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're going to win here and we are successful because we can grow the electorate. We can grow the type of people that go to caucus,"" he said. ""That's where the strength is. It's also -- that anyone who's 21 to 17, because you can caucus at 17 in Iowa if you're going to be 18 by November. Those are both young people, which we appeal to, but there they're also new caucusgoers, because they didn't caucus last time. So they're part of the new people that we're bringing into it and, since we do well with them, that's part of expanding the universe because they'll be brand new caucusgoers."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, from June 2 through 5 among a random sample of 600 likely Democratic caucus participants reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer. The sample included 433 who said they plan to attend the caucuses in-person and 167 who said they plan to attend virtually. Results for the combined sample of likely caucusgoers have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points; it is 4.7 points for those planning to attend in-person, 7.6 points for those who plan to attend virtually.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly identify Trump's event in Iowa.</p>]"

Ireland is a beautiful place and I enjoyed the opportunity to experience these unique Irish traditions. Thank you to Shannon Heritage for hosting this lovely event,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In lieu of the speeches and the public remarks -- and perhaps because she has become known as one of the most fashionable women in the world -- for Melania Trump, the visuals are even more acute. This may be especially so because she is less publicly verbose than most of her immediate predecessors -- for the curious public, sometimes there's just a visual to chew over.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reading the tea leaves of her brand of fashion diplomacy was a buzzy pastime this week, both in the headlines of British tabloids and in the background of chats between royal- and Trump-watchers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She doesn't pay attention to headlines,"" her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN of the scrutiny.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady herself said last fall during a solo trip to Africa when she was criticized for wearing a pith helmet: ""I wish people would focus on what I do, and not what I wear."" A wish, perhaps unfortunately for her, not likely to come true anytime soon, at least while on the global stage.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Regardless, questions remain.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Was the Gucci print dress emblazoned with drawings of iconic London landmarks like Buckingham Palace and the London Bridge too obvious a sartorial symbol? Did the red, cape-sleeve Givenchy gown at Winfield House in London serve as a silent symbol of support to Meghan Markle? (The President referred the duchess as ""nasty,"" but Givenchy was also the designer of Markle's wedding gown?) And how about the big black sunglasses she kept on for most of the day in Normandy, France, while honoring the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- should she have shown her eyes instead? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They're the sorts of questions that, remarkably, hover about a first lady, particularly Melania Trump, whose stealthy maneuvers and mysterious demeanor have earned her the nickname ""the Slovenian Sphinx"" by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Sartorial choices</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is the ongoing discussion over a first lady's choices -- should she pay homage to the host country by wearing designs by a homegrown designer? Michelle Obama was a big proponent of going that route, and would frequently travel globally with outfits specifically culled based on the label's association with the spots she would visit. Other first ladies, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush among them, would go the route of wearing iconic American designers on foreign soil, to represent the United States abroad.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump does neither the former, nor the latter, with consistency. Yet, as with most things one might expect from the first lady, she -- like her husband -- hardly abides by a standard playbook. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So while many fashion critics may have drawn in their breath at the sight of Trump getting off Marine One at Buckingham Palace on Monday wearing a fitted white dress with navy accents and a chic matching hat -- tilted just-so on top of her head -- they were not surprised to learn the designer of the ensemble was neither British nor American. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For her most iconic moment, an audience with the Queen of England and her family, Trump had chosen to wear a custom-designed Dolce &amp; Gabbana, an Italian fashion house with a longstanding relationship with the first lady. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Dolce &amp; Gabbana have also been in the headlines several times in recent months for their controversial comments surrounding race and sexuality; in November they canceled a runway show in China after cries of racial insensitivity following a marketing campaign that featured a video of a Chinese model attempting to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Yet the brand has been exceedingly loyal to Trump, who has worn them repeatedly since her husband took office, including for her official portrait, in which she sports a Dolce &amp; Gabbana black suit. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump, like the President, is prone to doing business with those who have her back and Stefano Gabbana has gone so far as to champion on his social media accounts how honored he is for her to wear the label. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's as many in the fashion world have been vocally opposed to dressing Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hat, which was a custom addition, was made by Trump's personal style adviser, Hervé Pierre, a frequent collaborator of the first lady. Pierre was born in France but is now a United States citizen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And while the dress and hat were not made by a British designer, it was quickly apparent the look resembled the silhouette and style of some of the dresses worn by the late Princess Diana. Or, the character Eliza Doolittle, played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 film version of ""My Fair Lady,"" also decidedly British.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>An evening with royalty</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the evening State Banquet at Buckingham Palace, Trump stuck with white, and she also kept to a non-UK designer, this time a sleeveless Dior Haute Couture gown with detail on the bodice. It was perhaps less imaginative than one might have hoped for the pomp and circumstance of the occasion, but Trump also ensured she wouldn't steal the spotlight from the Queen. The dress was elegant, but simple. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, also wore white that evening, as did Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who chose a tiered gown by British design house Alexander McQueen. The Queen wore white, too, and accessorized with the Burmese Ruby and Diamond Tiara, which she had made in 1973. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Photos of the day and evening of interactions between Trump and the Queen and Camilla showcased smiles and growing familiarity, a burgeoning friendship between the US first lady and two of Great Britain's centerpiece royals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She enjoyed chatting with both the Queen and Duchess of Cornwall,"" said Grisham to CNN. ""They are very warm and strong women.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President wore white tails to the white tie event, but his tuxedo, from head to toe, was lambasted for being remarkably ill-fitted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The banquet was another chance for the first lady to showcase a British or American designer, something Ivanka Trump did that evening, wearing a voluminous baby blue shirt-dress gown with embellishments by designer Carolina Herrera. It retails for $11,000. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike her stepmother, the Herrera would be the only outfit Ivanka wore in public during the London leg of the trip that was not British-made. Earlier that day she sported a feminine, flouncy-skirt Alessandra Rich suit with a white Philip Treacy hat; on Tuesday, for meetings and a tour at 10 Downing Street, Ivanka wore a polka-dot Burberry ensemble, and that evening, for the dinner at Winfield House, she was in a white gown by London-based designer Safiyaa.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Hostess abroad</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later in the trip, Melania Trump served as hostess for the reciprocal dinner at Winfield House, something she had been planning in Washington for weeks. Her duties included picking everything from the china to the color palette, menu, guest list and seating chart. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the event, the first lady chose a favored silhouette: the cape-sleeve dress. If you've paid attention to Trump's style at all over the past three to four years, it's clear she does love to have coats, jackets and, yes, dresses draped in cape-style over her shoulders. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, she's worn cape-style dresses for many formal occasions prior to Tuesday, once in Japan in 2017 to a state dinner there, and a short, black tuxedo version by Givenchy during a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House in 2018. The Tuesday night Winfield House dinner dress was also by Givenchy, though it was long and bright red and flowy, with sequins on the bodice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of Givenchy was as mysterious as most things Melania -- an iconic French brand, but now designed by British stylist Clare Waight Keller. Was the first lady wearing French, or British, or a dash of both? What was notable was the dress was not specially made for the occasion, nor was it customized in any way. In fact, you or I could go online and buy it in a few clicks ourselves, if we had a spare $8,340.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Honoring veterans</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Wednesday, it was another Trump repeat, to attend a ceremony in Portsmouth, England, honoring the 75th D-Day anniversary. Trump emerged from Marine One to take her seat with the President wearing a cream-colored coat by The Row (the label helmed by former child actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Unlike earlier iterations, this hat was decidedly British, by famed milliner Philip Treacy, whose designs are favored by members of the Royal Family, especially Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Trump's was more flying saucer-shaped than the vertical creations that Treacy hats often take, but it was no less fashionable on Trump, whose hair was swept up into a bun.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And just when one might start to think the white was a running sartorial theme, the first lady stepped out the following day for commemorative ceremonies in Normandy, France, in head-to-toe black. It marked what is by this reporter's count, at least her 8th public outing in a black coat as first lady. This one was by Dior, again, French and, again, unclear if the nod was purposeful to being on France's shores for the day, or whether it was simply what she wanted to wear, when she wanted to wear it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Trump departed Ireland on Friday, en route back home to Washington, she was wearing her oft-seen Burberry trench coat, belted tightly at the waist, with a light-blue silk headscarf looped over her head, tucked beneath her chin. While the scarf was an accessory she has never worn in public before that day, it is a look frequently favored by someone the first lady had just spent a good deal of time with on her trip ... Queen Elizabeth.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

In the 2018 cycle, chairman and president Brian O. Walsh told CNN that America First and its affiliated non-profit together raised about $75 million, well short of its $100 million goal.

While America First's operating expenses appear to be within the normal realm for super PACs, critics say the money the group has raised has been misspent on large consulting contracts and high-cost events with little payoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last cycle, as Republicans were on their way to losing their House majority, America First was paying the equivalent of annual salaries to firms attached to Trump associates such as Sean Spicer, Katrina Pierson and Corey Lewandowski (a former CNN contributor), not to mention Clarke, fueling the perception that the group has become a safe harbor for various Trump cast-offs and family friends.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a perception that people who got fired from the administration or couldn't get administration jobs were just dumped there,"" says a Republican operative aligned with the President's re-election effort who has spoken with potential donors to America First. ""What fundraising they have done they've squandered on parties and other stupid things.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Trump prepares to officially kick off his re-election campaign this month, Republicans around Washington have started asking the same question: What, exactly, is the President's top super PAC doing? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New leadership</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After years of the President dismissing super PACs as a ""scam,"" the Trump campaign in a May 7 statement <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/politics/trump-2020-and-big-money/index.html"" target=""_blank"">endorsed America First</a> as the ""one approved outside, non-campaign group."" The embrace reflected the view among his political apparatus that Trump needed to point donors to a single independent vehicle, but some Republicans are questioning whether America First is up to the task. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been a disaster,"" said one GOP operative close to the Trump campaign. ""I mean, totally lackluster leadership.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brad Parscale, who helped launch America First's non-profit policy arm in late January 2017, left a year later <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/brad-parscale-donald-trump-2020/index.html"" target=""_blank"">to manage Trump's 2020 campaign</a>, taking Pierson with him as the campaign's senior adviser. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In February, America First's chairman, longtime Trump family friend Tommy Hicks, left to join the RNC as its co-chair. In April, Linda McMahon, the Small Business Administration chief, resigned her Cabinet post and came aboard as America First's chairwoman.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and a two-time Republican senate candidate, is viewed by some skeptics as an acknowledgment of its past troubles. But so far the move has been welcomed by a number of donors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda McMahon joining America First marked a reset for them as they reload from the disastrous midterms to be Trump's wingman for a successful 2020 campaign,"" said Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based oil investor, Republican donor, and Trump supporter who gave $5,000 to America First in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda was brought in to see how to build confidence with the donor community and also to build a war chest to re-elect the president,"" says one Republican source.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked how fundraising has been going since she came on board, McMahon was upbeat about her conversations with donors. ""You have conversations, then you have follow-ups, then people come to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But all the initial responses that I am getting is that they are very delighted."" The next fundraising report to the FEC is due next month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Limited influence</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a super PAC, America First cannot contribute directly to a candidate's campaign or a party committee. It is limited to making ""independent expenditures"" -- advertisements, polling, and get-out-the-vote infrastructure -- and cannot coordinate with those candidates or campaigns. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But America First can also accept donations of any size from individuals, corporations, and other non-political organizations. That's what gives groups like it the chance to be ""super,"" and why some Republicans fear America First is failing to live up to its potential.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an interview with CNN, Walsh acknowledged the criticism that's been leveled at the group, but he pushed back on the idea America First hasn't delivered for the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We were active in '17 during the health care debate, and then we were active during tax reform. We did a lot of polling,"" Walsh said, pointing to 26 events with Vice President Mike Pence promoting tax reform.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But its influence was limited. Trump's tax cuts remain underwater in public approval. And Congress was unable to pass the White House-backed health care proposals while Republicans controlled the House.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First also paid for ads during the 2018 midterm elections on behalf of GOP congressional candidates, some of whom were in likely 2020 battleground states and others that were what Walsh called ""Trump Champions,"" or candidates who were particularly supportive of the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The group had a winning record in 2018 -- four of the six Senate candidates and seven of the 13 House candidates it backed won their races, including two House seats that flipped to the GOP, according to America First. Still, for the super PAC of a sitting president, America First wasn't much of a factor, a point that Walsh acknowledged. ""We were a supporting entity in the midterms, we will be a principal entity in the presidential,"" he told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>""Branding mechanisms""</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The biggest concern among Republicans is the super PAC's ""warehousing"" (as one Republican donor to the group put it) of figures from the broader Trump orbit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""communications consulting"" to firms linked to people affiliated with Trump, including Lewandowski, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson, according to the group's public filing with the FEC. Spicer's public relations firm RigWil received more than $53,000 in the last six months of 2018, while Pierson's consulting firm was paid $60,000 between October 2017 and February 2018 before she left to join Trump's 2020 campaign.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two firms tied to Clarke, DAC Enterprises and Ranger Zuke, received a total of $120,000 from the super PAC between September 2017 and November 2018. Clarke had been turned down for multiple positions in the Trump administration before being named a senior advisor and spokesman for America First in September 2017. Clarke's association with the group ended last year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lewandowski's firm Green Monster Consulting, meanwhile, was paid $75,000 for ""strategy consulting"" over the nine months he was America First's senior advisor. He left in March 2018 to join Vice President Pence's Great America PAC. (""Let Trump Be Trump,"" the book Lewandowski wrote with fellow Trump campaign veteran David Bossie, is displayed behind the front desk of America First's 8th floor suite in a shiny new office building in Crystal City, Virginia.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked about their work for America First, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson referred CNN to the group's spokeswoman, Kelly Sadler. Sadler said these associates of the President were employed as ""branding mechanisms"" to help ""establish ourselves as the Trump official PAC"" by making media appearances, signing small-dollar donor letters, and appearing at events.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walsh told CNN the super PAC does not plan on signing on any new surrogates. ""Now we only have Spicer,"" Walsh said. ""Spicer's kind of our principal person.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lewandowski did not respond to a request for comment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What have they been doing?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A month before McMahon took over, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/america-first-policies-mark-meadows-jim-jordan/index.html"" target=""_blank"">America First spent $100,000 on television ads</a> defending two stalwart Trump allies, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Both hail from strongly Republican districts and are in no danger of losing in 2020.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It's this kind of spending on safe candidates that has some Republicans around Washington scratching their heads. The GOP operative close with the Trump campaign called it ""general incompetence"" and a signal that a change in focus was necessary. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Republicans are hopeful that under McMahon, America First can transform from an open joke in GOP circles to the juggernaut it will need to be to help Trump win reelection. ""It's just been a real junior varsity operation, and the President sorely needs the help,"" said the operative.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

But not everyone is buying it. <strong>Ross Garber</strong>, who has defended four governors in impeachment proceedings, wrote that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/opinions/nancy-pelosis-weird-and-wrong-views-about-impeachment-garber/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Pelosi's focus on an eventual criminal case is an abdication of the House's constitutional responsibility</a>, and is just one of what he called her ""weird (and wrong)"" views on the topic.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""><strong>Michael Zeldin</strong> and <strong>Julian Zelizer</strong> pointed to three prime instances where Mueller's report lays out evidence of potential obstruction of justice that the House could consider in deciding whether to launch an impeachment inquiry. If Mueller had had the sweeping power granted by the now-defunct independent counsel law to Kenneth Starr, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/opinions/mueller-option-zeldin-zelizer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">he might well have already referred such evidence to Congress</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some Democrats argue that impeachment would give them a powerful weapon to crack the White House's stonewall, which has blocked testimony from key Trump aides. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on Mueller's findings. But instead of those who can answer questions about their experience in the Trump orbit, the featured witness is John Dean, the former White House counsel whose testimony helped end Richard Nixon's presidency and who is now a CNN contributor. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has been nearly seven weeks since the Mueller report became public,"" <strong>Elie Honig </strong>noted. ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/opinions/hope-hicks-testimony-critical-house-judiciary-committee-honig/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Congress has obtained exactly zero testimony from firsthand witnesses</a> about the facts set forth in the report. That won't change unless and until Congress takes a stand."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But is it really a good idea for Democrats to spurn Pelosi's advice? <strong>Anne-Marie Slaughter</strong> wrote in the Financial Times that the speaker's record as a Washington infighter is second to none.

The President's fascination with the royals and his decision to bring his adult children along for the ride flies in the face of centuries of American skepticism about hereditary monarchs, <strong>Kate Maltby </strong>wrote. Trump told interviewers he wanted to see a ""next generation"" meeting between his children and the younger British royals. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If Donald Trump really wanted his children to become like British royals,"" Maltby wrote, ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/opinions/trump-royal-family-state-visit-maltby/index.html"" target=""_blank"">he'd need to teach them the distinctly Windsor art of giving up power gracefully.</a> British royals never comment on politics -- and they don't even run their own Twitter accounts. The prospect seems, well, distinctly unTrumpish.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The tone was altogether different from the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/opinions/trump-queen-elizabeth-reagan/index.html"" target=""_blank"">more personal connection President Ronald Reagan made in a series of visits with Queen Elizabeth II</a>, former Reagan aide <strong>Mark Weinberg</strong> recalled.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As the Trump visit was beginning, it was a presidential son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, who briefly captured the spotlight, in an interview with Axios. <strong>Jill Filipovic</strong> was not impressed: ""Kushner sputtered and spun, looking like a little boy dressed up in his father's suit, unable to give a definitive or direct answer to nearly every question asked of him.

I hope she is OK. ..."" he said.) Trump later responded to Pelosi's prison comment by saying, ""She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why do Trump's remarks about women deserve the scrutiny they get? ""His comments set the tone for our national discourse and <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/opinions/trumps-meghan-markle-nasty-proves-her-point-alaimo/index.html"" target=""_blank"">for the way others -- including ordinary citizens and the federal government -- treat women in every realm of life</a>,"" <strong>Kara Alaimo </strong>wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump also clashed with London Mayor <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong>, who described the President in an Observer op-ed as ""one of the most egregious examples"" of the rise of far-right leaders: ""Rather than bestowing Trump with a grand platform of acceptability to the world, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/01/donald-trump-state-visit-red-carpet-unbritish"" target=""_blank"">we should be speaking out and saying that this (behavior) is unacceptable</a> -- and that it poses a grave threat to the values and principles we have fought hard to defend -- often together -- for decades."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fighting to defend those principles was what the D-Day invasion was all about. Richard Carter was a 20-year-old American serving as a radio operator aboard<strong> </strong>Madame X, a B-17 bomber based in Britain and part of a wave of US aircraft that helped prepare the way for the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Carter and his comrades, his son,<strong> Bill Carter</strong>, wrote for CNN Opinion, ""had signed up to serve their country in what they understood was a war for the survival of freedom. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/opinions/d-day-anniversary-dad-hero-carter/index.html"" target=""_blank"">It wasn't a sophisticated or complicated choice they were making; it wasn't even really a choice.

Then he met his match: It was librarian Emma Boettcher. She  knew that the ""North American city of Beverwyck had changed its name to Albany in 1664,"" <strong>David Perry</strong> recounted. ""She stayed in the category 'Capital 'A',' got the chance to double up, and bet her full sum of $7,600. She knew that Annapolis was the home to the annual United States sailboat show. ..."" It was a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/opinions/jeopardy-emma-boettcher-beat-james-holzauer-perry/index.html"" target=""_blank"">vindication of the value of ""a well-rounded liberal arts and sciences education.""</a> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Danger in the 'middle of the road'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Joe Biden maintained a strong lead in the still-early polls for the Democratic nomination for president, but it was far from a smooth week for the former vice president's campaign. The biggest flashpoint was over the Hyde Amendment, which generally prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within the space of a few days, Biden said he would favor repeal, then his campaign backpedaled, asserting that he maintained his longstanding support for the amendment. And finally, he told a roomful of Democrats in a speech in Atlanta that he would indeed favor getting rid of it. <strong>SE Cupp</strong> warned that changing his stance was a mistake for a candidate who once described his position on abortion as ""middle of the road."" She added, ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/opinions/biden-hyde-amendment-se-cupp/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Wasn't that the point of his candidacy?

A decade ago, the union made concessions to help keep GM, Ford and Chrysler alive in the face of lower-cost competition from foreign automakers. And it has never fully recovered. Gaining a foothold in a transplant factory would give the UAW an edge.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If all the plants were UAW represented, they'd have more power over the automakers,"" she said. But that hasn't been the case for the US auto industry since the early 1980s when the transplants first started opening.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The VW plant in Chattanooga would seem to be one of the UAW's better opportunities to win a vote.

At least seven people were arrested, the police <a href=""https://twitter.com/hkpoliceforce"" target=""_blank"">posted to Twitter</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At around 7:30 p.m. HK time (7:30 a.m. ET), five to six men with masks planned to occupy a main road in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Police said on Twitter.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police said they used pepper spray on the protesters before they escaped the area. Officers urged protesters to disperse. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands also gathered to protest against the extradition bill in cities across Australia Sunday. Similar marches are planned in other cities around the world, Hong Kong political group Demosisto said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Murder of tourist </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A grisly murder case in Taiwan, where a 20-year-old Hong Kong woman was allegedly killed by her boyfriend while on holiday there, expedited the case for the bill. Currently, the suspect cannot be sent from Hong Kong to face justice in Taiwan.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, Taipei has already said it will refuse to cooperate with the new law if it puts Taiwanese citizens at risk of being extradited to China. The self-ruled island has previously seen citizens accused of crimes in countries that do not recognize Taiwan diplomatically being <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/asia/taiwan-kenya-deportations/index.html"" target=""_blank"">handed to Chinese custody</a>, despite objections of Taipei.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this week, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, slammed the bill.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People have known exactly why there shouldn't be an extradition agreement with China for years,"" Patten said in a <a href=""https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/06/video-last-colonial-governor-hong-kong-chris-patten-says-govt-defence-extradition-bill-absolute-nonsense/"" target=""_blank"">video</a> message Thursday. ""The argument that it's better to have an extradition treaty than to abduct people illegally from Hong Kong -- are people really supposed to believe that?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last month, representatives from the European Union met with Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, during which they expressed concern over the bill. Members of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) have also <a href=""https://www.cecc.gov/media-center/press-releases/cecc-commissioners-send-letter-to-hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam"" target=""_blank"">spoken out</a> against the bill, warning Lam it could ""negatively impact the relationship between the United States and Hong Kong.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Unwanted and unneeded? </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Business groups in Hong Kong usually take a neutral stance on contentious political issues. But this time they have also spoken out against the bill. In a bid to secure their support, the government has limited the scope of extraditable offenses -- but for some that is still not enough. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong <a href=""https://www.amcham.org.hk/news/press-release-proposed-fugitive-offenders-ordinance"" target=""_blank"">warned</a> last week that there were ""too many uncertainties in fundamental sections of the proposed legislation"" for it to be passed in its current form. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hong Kong is not ready to see this bill passed and we do not see why it should be rushed through when the loophole it seeks to address has existed for 20 years,"" AmCham said in a statement. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But government spokesman Matthew Cheung said the move was time sensitive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The suspect in the Taiwan murder case is serving sentences for other criminal offenses in Hong Kong but is expected to be released this October,"" Cheung said. ""There is thus a pressing need to provide a legal basis for the assistance that we want to render to Taiwan, before the (legislature) goes into summer recess from mid-July to October."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cheung did not address Taipei's concerns over the bill. Separately, Lam <a href=""https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2019/06/20190604/20190604_103434_978.html"" target=""_blank"">said</a> it was ""unfounded"" to suggest the Hong Kong government ""will just follow the instructions given by the Central Government and surrender whatever fugitives that the Central Government wants."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Fierce opposition </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The extradition bill, particularly an attempt to fast track it through Hong Kong's semi-democratic legislature, has reinvigorated the city's flagging opposition movement after numerous setbacks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Organizers claimed 130,000 people took part in a protest against the bill <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/asia/hk-protest-extradition-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">in April</a>. While police gave the lower figure of 22,800, it was still the biggest protest since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, an ultimately unsuccessful protest over political reform which shut down parts of the city for months. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fears over the bill -- and criticism from a broad swath of Hong Kong society -- echo 2003 when half a million people took to the streets to oppose the passage of an anti-sedition law. That legislation was shelved but the issue has become such a hot button topic in Hong Kong that -- despite promising to do so -- no governments since have attempted to introduce it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sunday's protest comes after the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/asia/tiananmen-june-4-china-censorship-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre</a> on June 4, a pivotal moment which dashed hopes that China would democratize before it took control of Hong Kong in 1997. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hong Kong has commemorated the massacre with a candlelit vigil ever since, the only place on Chinese soil where mass remembrances are held. Organizers said more than 180,000 people joined a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/asia/gallery/tiananmen-square-30th-anniversary-hong-kong-vigil/index.html"" target=""_blank"">vigil in the city's Victoria Park on Tuesday</a>, the largest such event since the 25th anniversary in 2014, which came in the politically fraught run-up to the Umbrella protests. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Eric Cheung contributed to this story from Hong Kong.</p>]"

And on this week's episode I go to a bunch of Black People Meetings (and one ""people of color"" meeting) in a place that has been designed and governed to have a lot of them: Milwaukee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why Milwaukee? Because Milwaukee regularly comes up No. 1 on lists of America's most segregated cities.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If that surprises you, you are not alone. Most people who don't know Milwaukee have no idea it is one of America's blackest major cities. Milwaukee <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/03/05/390723644/why-is-milwaukee-so-bad-for-black-people"" target=""_blank"">is 40% black</a>, which makes it blacker than <a href=""http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/chicago-population/"" target=""_blank"">Chicago</a>, <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-blacks-latinos-south-la-20170228-story.html"" target=""_blank"">Compton</a>, and <a href=""http://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/oakland-population/"" target=""_blank"">Oakland, California</a>, where I live. And as I learned from the people I met there, the racism felt in Milwaukee extends into the suburbs and throughout the entire state of Wisconsin.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Imagine being a black person, living in Wisconsin (a state that is so racist that you refer to it as <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/television-radio/2019/05/07/cnns-united-shades-america-w-kamau-bell-air-show-race-milwaukee/3662625002/"" target=""_blank"">""Wississippi""</a>), and when you tell people who live outside of the state they often say, ""THERE ARE BLACK PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN?"" It's something like screaming, ""HELP MY HOUSE IS ON FIRE!"" and the fire department says, ""You own a house?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Milwaukee is often noted as the <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/12/17/black-white-segregation-edges-downward-since-2000-census-shows/"" target=""_blank"">most segregated city in the country</a> because it has the highest number of neighborhoods that are clearly separated by race. Milwaukee also has all of the issues that come along with segregation, including <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/crime/2019/01/24/milwaukee-police-officers-accused-brutality-cover-up/2657080002/"" target=""_blank"">police violence</a>, high rates of <a href=""https://www.wuwm.com/topic/project-milwaukee-black-men-prison#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">incarceration</a> and <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/tv/2019/06/07/usoa-405-ron-1.cnn.html"" target=""_blank"">disproportionate</a> <a href=""https://theintercept.com/2018/04/11/school-to-prison-pipeline-milwaukee/"" target=""_blank"">disciplinary action against students of color</a>. The setting of the TV show ""Happy Days"" and the home of the American institution of Harley Davidson is also home to a lot of structural and institutional racism.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To learn more about all this, I started by meeting with two experts: historian <a href=""https://www.wuwm.com/post/reggie-jackson-milwaukee-segregation-americas-black-holocaust-museum#stream/0"" target=""_blank"">Reggie Jackson</a> in Sherman Park and professor <a href=""https://syreetamcfadden.com/"" target=""_blank"">Syreeta McFadden</a> at the best-named coffee shop ever, ""Coffee Makes You Black.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reggie shares the story of the 2016 killing of 23-year-old <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/21/us/milwaukee-heaggan-brown-shooting-trial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Sylville Smith</a> and the protest that erupted in Sherman Park near the site of the shooting. (We also rolled up to our meeting with Reggie <a href=""https://www.jsonline.com/story/entertainment/television-radio/2019/05/07/cnns-united-shades-america-w-kamau-bell-air-show-race-milwaukee/3662625002/"" target=""_blank"">as the cops were rolling up on a group of black people</a>. A white woman had called the cops because the black people were handing out Halloween candy in late October without a permit ... and no, you don't need a permit for that.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Syreeta breaks down the effects of the discriminatory home loan practices known as <a href=""https://www.wiscontext.org/how-redlining-continues-shape-racial-segregation-milwaukee"" target=""_blank"">redlining</a>, which drew lines and zones on city maps where black people could and couldn't live. We did a deep dive about racism in our brief time together. And as we were editing the show, I realized that we had never actually defined racism on previous episodes. So this time, we did.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In my experience, most people define racism as simply hating someone because of their skin color.  Occasionally, I -- incorrectly -- use that definition, too. But every anti-racist activist and academic I know believes that treating someone poorly because of their skin color is actually just prejudice. Racism requires prejudice plus power.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because this country was founded in large part through the genocide of the indigenous people of this land and then largely built on the free labor of enslaved Africans, prejudice is embedded in all of America's structures and institutions. That's how prejudice gets its power and becomes racism. That's why you can't just hire black police officers and expect the whole institution of policing not to be still packed with racism. And white folks, if that's making your head swim right now, imagine all of that going through your head every time you apply for a job, talk to a police officer or simply walk outdoors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While undoing all of this might seem way too big and daunting a task, there are still lots of people in Milwaukee working hard to dismantle structural racism. <a href=""https://uwm.edu/sce/instructors/monique-liston-ph-d/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Monique Liston</a>, for example, is teaching anti-racist workshops through her learning organization, Ubuntu Research and Evaluation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Harvard-educated entrepreneur <a href=""https://www.biztimes.com/2019/industries/arts-entertainment-sports/lisa-caesar/"" target=""_blank"">Lisa Caesar</a> and her brother, John Ridley -- yup, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""12 Years a Slave"" -- are fighting brain drain in Milwaukee through an artist's collective they have founded called No Studios.  It aims to help people's showbiz dreams come true without people having to leave Milwaukee. I also had some pizza with young activists from L.I.T., which stands for <a href=""https://www.litmke.org/"" target=""_blank"">Leaders Igniting Transformation</a>. They are a group who help students of color navigate a school system that too often sees them as statistics and not individuals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One of my meetings in Milwaukee was an inside job. Since I am what I like to call the ACLU's Celebrity Ambassador of Racial Justice, the ACLU set me up with their Wisconsin chapter, where I talked with <a href=""http://aclu-wi.org/sites/default/files/issue/pdf/CollinsVMilwaukeeComplaint.pdf"" target=""_blank"">plaintiffs</a> Gregory Chambers, Stephen Jansen and Wisconsin state representative <a href=""https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2019/legislators/assembly/1811"" target=""_blank"">David Crowley</a>. Chambers and Jansen recently <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/07/11/628020991/milwaukee-council-oks-3-4-million-settlement-of-police-stop-and-frisk-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">won</a> an important case against the Milwaukee Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I was even lucky enough to speak with Maria Hamilton about her powerful work with <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/united-by-death-mothers-of-the-movement-breathes-new-l-1833791229"" target=""_blank"">Mothers of the Movement</a> and <a href=""https://www.mothersforjusticeunited.org/"" target=""_blank"">Mothers for Justice United</a>.

Maria also started her own group, Mothers for Justice United, to help all of the moms whose families have been devastated by police violence. The fact that we even need these groups is an indictment of our country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I ended my series of black people meetings and POC meetings in Milwaukee with a special lesson from professor <a href=""https://www.johnbdiamond.com/about.html"" target=""_blank"">John Diamond</a>, an expert on implicit bias. <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/tv/2019/06/07/usoa-405-ron-4.cnn.html"" target=""_blank"">Implicit bias</a> is a term that describes the way our brains are affected by growing up within systems that enact oppression. You'll learn all about it if you watch the show and you'll get to see me take a test that measures how biased I am.  You'll also see that I give everyone in the audience a homework assignment -- to take an implicit bias test, easily available online thanks to <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html"" target=""_blank"">Project Implicit</a>, an international research collaboration founded in 1998 by scientists at Harvard, UVA and University of Washington. Everyone should take one. Whether you think you're biased or not, racism is a part of your life. It's in the air we breathe. But if we measure our bias, hopefully we can dismantle it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So this week, welcome to the Black People meeting! But white folks, please don't bring <a href=""https://variety.com/video/chadwick-boseman-snl-potato-salad-joke/"" target=""_blank"">your potato salad with the raisins in it</a>.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

We think so. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">McCarthy has proved her political comedy chops on the show with <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/16/entertainment/snl-jimmy-fallon-jared-kushner-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">her performance</a> as former White House press secretary Sean Spicer.

Can you say Emmy bait, anyone?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>Dana Carvey</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carvey is an ""SNL"" legend. His <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHyW0N5f7zQ"" target=""_blank"">Church Lady character</a> is one of the greats, plus he's already nailed another former president with his portrayal of George H.W.

Why would we deny ourselves that treat? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>James Corden</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sure, hosting the ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" on CBS puts the eponymous star at a slight disadvantage to star on NBC's ""SNL.""  But come on, Corden is in <em>everything</em> right now. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If Kate McKinnon can play multiple European leaders, then surely a Brit can take aim at Trump.

Fourteen months later, the Palmers say they still don't know what really happened. But they are suspicious because when Palmer's body was returned to them, his throat, heart and brain were missing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This entire case smacks of a cover-up,"" civil rights attorney Lee Merritt told CNN by phone.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/12/us/beneath-the-skin/"" target=""_blank"">Beneath the Skin: Horrific cuts cover her son's body after he's shot dead by police</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family hired Merritt to help find answers because so far, they have been unable to get them on their own, they say. Merritt says prison and county officials have not been cooperative with providing an official manner of death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But York County Coroner Pam Gay said those organs were actually retained as part of the forensic autopsy for additional testing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There were never any missing organs,"" Gay told CNN on Saturday. ""The lab that does our autopsies has the organs. Coroner's offices don't always have a morgue or a forensic pathologist. We contract those services out. We utilize a team in Allentown. That's who retains the specimens. They don't always tell us what they retain. We made that clear to the family from the beginning.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She noted that removing the throat is typical in this kind of investigation because ""we have to make sure there wasn't any kind of component that caused asphyxia.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gay also said local authorities have been cooperative.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We were in communications with them directly and through their attorney,"" she said. ""I understand their need and desire for answers. We are working to do that. The truth will come out. I can't comment on the active investigation.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Representatives for the prison could not be reached for comment Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An initial autopsy by the York County Coroner's Office stated Palmer died after an incident ""following an excited state"" during which he ""began hitting his head against the inside of his cell door"" and was restrained. The report says Palmer became agitated as a result of ""methamphetamine toxicity."" A probable ""sickling red cell disorder"" as listed as a contributing factor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to his family, Palmer never had any health problems leading up to his death. They also say the autopsy report of him hitting himself is completely out of character.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The York County Coroner's Office updated its autopsy results on July 28, 2018, to include a manner of death, which it listed as ""undetermined."" The autopsy report says details of the autopsy may be corrected as more information becomes available.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gay said investigations into possible drug-related deaths can take one to three years. She ruled out one cause of death, saying it wasn't suicide.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says Palmer did have ""some history of drug use,"" but never meth. Prison processing reports made available to the family provided no indication that Palmer was under the influence or had any drug paraphernalia listed in his items when he arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He would have had to receive (the meth) in the jail itself. We don't believe that happened,"" Merritt said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer's body was returned to his family, but it was only after the family hired their own independent forensic pathologist that they discovered Palmer's body was missing three body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's not unusual to take organs out of a body during an autopsy, especially if you believe they were subject to trauma. The highly unusual part is to misplace them,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For seven months, the family could not track down Palmer's brain, heart or throat. They say they were told by the York County Coroner to check with the funeral home for the body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The funeral home says they hadn't touched the body,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says they were later told by the coroner that the body parts were at an independent lab. However, the lab, Merritt says, has refused to hand over the parts, citing an ongoing investigation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt says the family believes the body parts will reveal details of how Palmer died. ""But we haven't been able to get them back yet,"" Merritt said. ""His constitutional rights are being violated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">CNN reached out to the York County District Attorney's Office for comment. Kyle King, the chief administrator and spokesman for the district attorney, told CNN by phone, ""The office of the district attorney does not comment on pending or ongoing investigations.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When asked how long an investigation into a case like this typically takes, King said, ""Every investigation is unique."" He did not answer when asked why, more than one year after Palmer's death, there is still no official determination about his cause of death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Multiple calls to the Pennsylvania State Police, which is listed as the investigating police agency on the autopsy, were not returned. A voicemail message left with the York County Coroner's Office also went unanswered.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of the five children in the Palmer family, Everett Palmer Jr. was like the glue that kept the family bond strong, his brother Dwayne said. He was a ""gentle giant,"" tall and muscular, and served as a US Army paratrooper. An avid sports fan, especially of basketball, Palmer was often found working out in the gym or helping others achieve their goals as a personal trainer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer also enjoyed being a DJ and had a very ""eclectic taste in music,"" preferring heavy metal, according to his brother, Dwayne. He may have looked imposing, his brother says, but he loved to smile.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He joked around a lot. He was the life of the family,"" Dwayne Palmer said. ""He wasn't a perfect person, but certainly not somebody that's a rabble-rouser, fighting, starting trouble or anything like that. He was a loving person.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Speaking from his home in New York, Dwayne says the family just wants to know what happened. He says the information they have been given so far is scant. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We don't believe anything (officials) are telling us at this point,"" he said. ""It's a tremendous loss for our family. We are devastated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the autopsy report, on the morning of his death, Everett Palmer Jr. was taken to a medical clinic where he was noted to be unresponsive. He was transferred to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If he was being processed for something that he did wrong in terms of the DUI -- he should be held accountable for that -- but it shouldn't be a death sentence, certainly inside of a jail,"" his brother added. ""We know that there are good people in that prison system. We appeal to them to come forward and share what they know.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Palmer family has put in a Freedom of Information Act request for any video recordings from the York County Prison while Palmer was in their custody.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been over a year and we want some answers. He was delivered back to us without organs. We want closure,"" Palmer said. ""If something criminal happened, and I believe something criminal did happen, we want the people that was involved in that to be held accountable.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The major problem in this case is what happened to Everett Palmer Jr. in a holding cell in police custody,"" Merritt said Saturday on CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Was a chokehold applied to Palmer? he asked. Why haven't other reports or video shot in the cell been released to the family? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We expect for York County and for the district attorney ... to do a thorough, complete investigation, which includes the autopsy, but it also includes gathering any reports about physical contact that was required in that cell, and releasing the videos to the family,"" Merritt said.

Five years later, with the passage of my bill by both houses of the legislature Tuesday, New York is poised to become <a href=""https://nyassembly.gov/leg/?default_fld=&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A01303&amp;term=0&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Floor%26nbspVotes=Y&amp;Memo=Y&amp;Text=Y"" target=""_blank"">the first state in the nation to ban cat declawing</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why did we do this? The reason is simple.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Declawing a cat is not like getting a mani-pedi at a day spa. Whether it is performed by laser or the old-fashioned way, it's a surgery during which nearly all of the cat's first-toe bones, along with the tendons and ligaments, are removed. This brutal, permanent disfigurement leaves many cats with <a href=""https://www.drmartybecker.com/veterinary-medicine/the-tragedy-of-post-declaw-pain-syndrome-and-how-to-help-cats-who-suffer-from-it/"" target=""_blank"">chronic, lifelong pain</a>, much like amputees who experience phantom pain associated with their lost limbs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike human amputation, which is most often performed to save a life, cats are declawed to save a couch or the curtains.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cats scratch things. Like purring and meowing, scratching is an instinct, something cats are born to do. Denying cats the ability to satisfy one of their most basic behaviors is cruel. It also causes many cats to experience a variety of <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523124130.htm"" target=""_blank"">negative side effects</a>, including aggression and depression. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many declawed cats resort to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098612X17705044"" target=""_blank"">biting and litter box avoidance or both</a>. Imagine coming home from 10 toe bone amputations and then having to dig in the litter box gravel or being robbed of your first line of defense, your nails, and having to use your teeth instead. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biting is much more likely than scratching to <a href=""https://admin.avma.org/News/Journals/Collections/Documents/javma_234_3_336.pdf"" target=""_blank"">transmit dangerous bacteria</a> to immuno-compromised cat lovers, which is why health <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/bartonella/cat-scratch/index.html"" target=""_blank"">authorities don't recommend</a> cat declawing to protect people with compromised immune systems. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The behavioral issues that result from declawing cause families to surrender their cats to shelters. If people can't tolerate a little bit of cat scratching, they certainly won't tolerate aggression, biting, depression and litter box avoidance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though the law in most states, including New York, still <a href=""https://aldf.org/issue/animals-legal-status/"" target=""_blank"">considers animals property</a>, we know better. Our cats are part of our families.

The function of the 911 system is to summon the police to serve and protect. Recently, however, some people have been using 911 to make the police complicit in their racial bias. </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">In April 2018, for instance, 911 was used<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/04/14/starbucks-apologizes-after-employee-calls-police-on-black-men-waiting-at-a-table/?utm_term=.44b6d4136d44"" target=""_blank""> to call police to a Philadelphia Starbucks</a> because two African-American men did not order anything while waiting for a friend to show up.

The Oregon state Senate approved a bill to enable victims of bias-motivated 911 calls ""to sue the caller for up to $250 in small-claims court. In Michigan, the city of Grand Rapids is considering enacting an ordinance that would make it a ""<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-living-while-black-police-20190527-story.html"" target=""_blank"">criminal misdemeanor to racially profile people of color for participating in their lives</a>."" The ordinance would subject those who make racially biased 911 calls to a $500 fine. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I am absolutely convinced that the legislators and city commissioners behind this bill and proposed ordinance have their hearts in the right place. It is a good, just and compassionate place. Nevertheless, the legislation promises to be more problematic than effective. The Oregon law would give victims of bias-motivated 911 calls standing to file suit -- at $250, a token suit -- which would prevail only if the plaintiff can ""prove the caller had racist intent, and that the caller summoned a police officer to purposefully discriminate or damage a person's reputation."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Speaking as someone who has devoted most of a 40-year career to law enforcement, serving as everything from deputy sheriff to police chief and director of public safety, here are the relevant facts as I see them. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">First, bias-motivated 911 calls are real -- common, in fact. Second, bias-motivated 911 calls are wrong -- hurtful and just plain wrong. Third, they are dangerous, putting lives in jeopardy by sending officers on unnecessary calls, thus making them unavailable for real emergencies. Worse, bias-motivated calls pit the police against the public in potentially dangerous confrontations. Although officers are trained to think before they act, they also respond to every call with a heightened awareness of imminent danger. People don't call 911 because they feel safe, secure and happy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Worst of all, responding to a bias-motivated call makes officers unwilling actors in a bias-driven drama. This has the potential of damaging police-community relations, eroding the community's trust in law enforcement and the law itself, calling into question the legitimacy of the individual officers responding to the call. Nowhere is this truer than in communities of color.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> As well-intentioned as the Grand Rapids and Oregon proposals are, establishing<em> mens rea</em> -- the accused person's consciousness of wrongdoing -- is a complex and solemn task that often consumes days or even weeks of trial time, involving attorneys, juries and judges. Practically speaking, I don't see many suits being brought under these laws, and I imagine far fewer such suits would succeed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> As for the Grand Rapids proposal, it exists only as a <a href=""http://grandrapidscitymi.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&amp;MeetingID=5340&amp;MediaPosition=&amp;ID=8560&amp;CssClass="" target=""_blank"">proposed amendment</a> to the city code, but speaking as a former street cop, I have to say that the city's lawyers will have their work cut out for them trying to translate the fuzzy concept of ""racially profil(ing) people of color for participating in their lives"" into an arrestable offense. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ultimately, the risks inherent in these measures outweigh any good they might do, such as raising a community's consciousness. The danger here is that fear of a lawsuit or misdemeanor criminal charge will discourage citizens from making legitimate 911 calls regarding legitimately suspicious activity or even actual crimes. We want people to use 911. We instruct the public that if they see something, they should say something. Better to make a 911 call that proves unwarranted than to avoid making a call that might save a life, prevent a crime or help to solve a case.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bias-motivated 911 calls are real, they are common, and they are both hurtful and wrong. They are also already against the law. I can't think of any jurisdiction that does not have a law against falsely reporting a crime. Surely, at least some bias-motivated 911 calls can be prosecuted under these existing laws. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But we need something more effective than threatening people with vague laws and lawsuits. Our communities would be better served if their police departments and their schools would do something to educate people on how bias distorts perceptions, produces fear and raises suspicions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Laws and lawsuits are afterthoughts and moral bandages. They do not address the systemic social, economic, political and personal drivers of racism, xenophobia and irrational fear of otherness. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The strength of the United States is and has always been its diversity. Democracy, a form of government built on and for diversity, demands that each of us overcome our biases, and neither a $250 lawsuit nor a $500 misdemeanor fine is going to help us in this most vital, rewarding and unifying enterprise. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Ireland is a beautiful place and I enjoyed the opportunity to experience these unique Irish traditions. Thank you to Shannon Heritage for hosting this lovely event,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In lieu of the speeches and the public remarks -- and perhaps because she has become known as one of the most fashionable women in the world -- for Melania Trump, the visuals are even more acute. This may be especially so because she is less publicly verbose than most of her immediate predecessors -- for the curious public, sometimes there's just a visual to chew over.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reading the tea leaves of her brand of fashion diplomacy was a buzzy pastime this week, both in the headlines of British tabloids and in the background of chats between royal- and Trump-watchers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She doesn't pay attention to headlines,"" her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN of the scrutiny.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady herself said last fall during a solo trip to Africa when she was criticized for wearing a pith helmet: ""I wish people would focus on what I do, and not what I wear."" A wish, perhaps unfortunately for her, not likely to come true anytime soon, at least while on the global stage.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Regardless, questions remain.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Was the Gucci print dress emblazoned with drawings of iconic London landmarks like Buckingham Palace and the London Bridge too obvious a sartorial symbol? Did the red, cape-sleeve Givenchy gown at Winfield House in London serve as a silent symbol of support to Meghan Markle? (The President referred the duchess as ""nasty,"" but Givenchy was also the designer of Markle's wedding gown?) And how about the big black sunglasses she kept on for most of the day in Normandy, France, while honoring the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- should she have shown her eyes instead? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They're the sorts of questions that, remarkably, hover about a first lady, particularly Melania Trump, whose stealthy maneuvers and mysterious demeanor have earned her the nickname ""the Slovenian Sphinx"" by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Sartorial choices</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is the ongoing discussion over a first lady's choices -- should she pay homage to the host country by wearing designs by a homegrown designer? Michelle Obama was a big proponent of going that route, and would frequently travel globally with outfits specifically culled based on the label's association with the spots she would visit. Other first ladies, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush among them, would go the route of wearing iconic American designers on foreign soil, to represent the United States abroad.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump does neither the former, nor the latter, with consistency. Yet, as with most things one might expect from the first lady, she -- like her husband -- hardly abides by a standard playbook. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So while many fashion critics may have drawn in their breath at the sight of Trump getting off Marine One at Buckingham Palace on Monday wearing a fitted white dress with navy accents and a chic matching hat -- tilted just-so on top of her head -- they were not surprised to learn the designer of the ensemble was neither British nor American. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For her most iconic moment, an audience with the Queen of England and her family, Trump had chosen to wear a custom-designed Dolce &amp; Gabbana, an Italian fashion house with a longstanding relationship with the first lady. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Dolce &amp; Gabbana have also been in the headlines several times in recent months for their controversial comments surrounding race and sexuality; in November they canceled a runway show in China after cries of racial insensitivity following a marketing campaign that featured a video of a Chinese model attempting to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Yet the brand has been exceedingly loyal to Trump, who has worn them repeatedly since her husband took office, including for her official portrait, in which she sports a Dolce &amp; Gabbana black suit. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump, like the President, is prone to doing business with those who have her back and Stefano Gabbana has gone so far as to champion on his social media accounts how honored he is for her to wear the label. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's as many in the fashion world have been vocally opposed to dressing Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hat, which was a custom addition, was made by Trump's personal style adviser, Hervé Pierre, a frequent collaborator of the first lady. Pierre was born in France but is now a United States citizen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And while the dress and hat were not made by a British designer, it was quickly apparent the look resembled the silhouette and style of some of the dresses worn by the late Princess Diana. Or, the character Eliza Doolittle, played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 film version of ""My Fair Lady,"" also decidedly British.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>An evening with royalty</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the evening State Banquet at Buckingham Palace, Trump stuck with white, and she also kept to a non-UK designer, this time a sleeveless Dior Haute Couture gown with detail on the bodice. It was perhaps less imaginative than one might have hoped for the pomp and circumstance of the occasion, but Trump also ensured she wouldn't steal the spotlight from the Queen. The dress was elegant, but simple. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, also wore white that evening, as did Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who chose a tiered gown by British design house Alexander McQueen. The Queen wore white, too, and accessorized with the Burmese Ruby and Diamond Tiara, which she had made in 1973. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Photos of the day and evening of interactions between Trump and the Queen and Camilla showcased smiles and growing familiarity, a burgeoning friendship between the US first lady and two of Great Britain's centerpiece royals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She enjoyed chatting with both the Queen and Duchess of Cornwall,"" said Grisham to CNN. ""They are very warm and strong women.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President wore white tails to the white tie event, but his tuxedo, from head to toe, was lambasted for being remarkably ill-fitted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The banquet was another chance for the first lady to showcase a British or American designer, something Ivanka Trump did that evening, wearing a voluminous baby blue shirt-dress gown with embellishments by designer Carolina Herrera. It retails for $11,000. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike her stepmother, the Herrera would be the only outfit Ivanka wore in public during the London leg of the trip that was not British-made. Earlier that day she sported a feminine, flouncy-skirt Alessandra Rich suit with a white Philip Treacy hat; on Tuesday, for meetings and a tour at 10 Downing Street, Ivanka wore a polka-dot Burberry ensemble, and that evening, for the dinner at Winfield House, she was in a white gown by London-based designer Safiyaa.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Hostess abroad</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later in the trip, Melania Trump served as hostess for the reciprocal dinner at Winfield House, something she had been planning in Washington for weeks. Her duties included picking everything from the china to the color palette, menu, guest list and seating chart. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the event, the first lady chose a favored silhouette: the cape-sleeve dress. If you've paid attention to Trump's style at all over the past three to four years, it's clear she does love to have coats, jackets and, yes, dresses draped in cape-style over her shoulders. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, she's worn cape-style dresses for many formal occasions prior to Tuesday, once in Japan in 2017 to a state dinner there, and a short, black tuxedo version by Givenchy during a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House in 2018. The Tuesday night Winfield House dinner dress was also by Givenchy, though it was long and bright red and flowy, with sequins on the bodice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of Givenchy was as mysterious as most things Melania -- an iconic French brand, but now designed by British stylist Clare Waight Keller. Was the first lady wearing French, or British, or a dash of both? What was notable was the dress was not specially made for the occasion, nor was it customized in any way. In fact, you or I could go online and buy it in a few clicks ourselves, if we had a spare $8,340.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Honoring veterans</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Wednesday, it was another Trump repeat, to attend a ceremony in Portsmouth, England, honoring the 75th D-Day anniversary. Trump emerged from Marine One to take her seat with the President wearing a cream-colored coat by The Row (the label helmed by former child actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Unlike earlier iterations, this hat was decidedly British, by famed milliner Philip Treacy, whose designs are favored by members of the Royal Family, especially Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Trump's was more flying saucer-shaped than the vertical creations that Treacy hats often take, but it was no less fashionable on Trump, whose hair was swept up into a bun.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And just when one might start to think the white was a running sartorial theme, the first lady stepped out the following day for commemorative ceremonies in Normandy, France, in head-to-toe black. It marked what is by this reporter's count, at least her 8th public outing in a black coat as first lady. This one was by Dior, again, French and, again, unclear if the nod was purposeful to being on France's shores for the day, or whether it was simply what she wanted to wear, when she wanted to wear it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Trump departed Ireland on Friday, en route back home to Washington, she was wearing her oft-seen Burberry trench coat, belted tightly at the waist, with a light-blue silk headscarf looped over her head, tucked beneath her chin. While the scarf was an accessory she has never worn in public before that day, it is a look frequently favored by someone the first lady had just spent a good deal of time with on her trip ... Queen Elizabeth.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Amy Klobuchar) land at 2% each, the rest hold 1% support or less.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The poll is the first from CNN and the Des Moines Register since the Iowa Democratic Party formally proposed rules for its new virtual caucus. The rules allocate 90% of state delegate equivalents based on the results among those who caucus in-person, while 10% will be based on the results among those who caucus virtually, regardless of the actual number of people who choose to participate each way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the poll, 28% of those who say they are definitely or probably going to participate at this point say they are likely to do so virtually. Although Biden fares better among likely virtual participants (33%) than among likely in-person caucusgoers (23%), combining likely caucus participants' preferences according to the new rules does not move the numbers meaningfully for any candidate from what they would have been if the 90 to 10 ratio had not been applied. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But those rules could bring a slew of new people to the caucuses next February. Those who say they are likely to participate virtually are more likely to be first-time caucus attendees (52% vs. 17% of those who say they'll attend in-person), they are more apt to be registered as independents (31% vs. 11% among likely in-person attendees) and they are younger (63% under age 45 vs. 51% among in-person attendees).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Beyond Biden's lower overall support, the poll also suggests some warning signs for him beneath those numbers. His supporters are less apt than others to say they are ""extremely enthusiastic"" about him (29% vs. 39% for backers of all other candidates, and 43% among those backing his nearest competition in Sanders, Warren or Buttigieg). He also remains the best-known candidate in the field, suggesting he has less room to grow than other candidates who Iowa's Democratic caucusgoers are still getting to know.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The closer contest in Iowa also suggests a steeper challenge for 2016 runner-up Sanders than he faces elsewhere. In most national polling, he has held second place solo or been competitive with Biden, as he has in earlier Iowa surveys. In this poll, Sanders fares better with those who are less committed to showing up on caucus night. Among those who say they will probably attend in-person, he stands at 20%, while among those who say they are definite attenders, he's at 14%. That pattern holds among those who plan to attend virtually.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The results are also notable for the lack of traction by most of the 23-candidate field tested in the poll. The survey asked likely caucusgoers to name their first and second choice candidates, and then for each other candidate, asked whether the potential caucusgoer was ""actively considering"" that candidate, or not.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among likely in-person caucusgoers, only five candidates were in active consideration by a majority: Biden (61%), Warren (61%), Sanders (56%), Buttigieg (52%) and Harris (52%). The next closest candidates were under active consideration by about 4 in 10: Cory Booker at 43% and O'Rourke at 39%. Among potential virtual caucusgoers, the picture is similar. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's notable among both likely in-person and likely virtual caucusgoers is just how few are even considering some of the lower-tier candidates. Thirteen of the 23 tested candidates are under consideration by fewer than 2 in 10 in either group, that includes both candidates who have won election statewide (Jay Inslee, John Hickenlooper, Michael Bennet, Steve Bullock) as well as those who are making outsider bids for the nomination (Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Wayne Messam). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Outside of candidate preferences, about two-thirds of likely caucusgoers, regardless of how they plan to participate, say they would prefer that the winner in Iowa be someone with a strong chance of beating Trump over a candidate who shares their views on major issues. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when asked to choose among desirable qualities in a candidate, electability ranked fourth on a list of seven for both sets of possible caucus participants. A majority in both groups named integrity a top trait (56% among in-person, 61% among virtual), and 40% in each chose intelligence. Just over a third in each group picked leadership (34% in-person, 36% virtual) and about a quarter picked electability (25% in-person and 23% virtual). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likely Iowa caucusgoers are divided over how Democrats in Congress ought to handle the possibility of impeachment proceedings for Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About half of likely Iowa caucusgoers (48% regardless of how they plan to participate), say they think Democrats in Congress ought to continue investigating the President rather than move forward on formal impeachment proceedings now. Slightly fewer in each group say they think congressional Democrats would be shirking their constitutional duty if they do not move ahead on impeachment as soon as possible (42% among in-person, 45% among virtual).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When asked by reporters in Iowa Saturday night about the poll's numbers, Buttigieg said it was ""encouraging,"" but still ""early"" in the race.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Well, I'd say it's very encouraging. It shows a lot of momentum and it shows that campaigning works. We've invested a lot of time and a lot of effort, not just nationally, but getting to be known in Iowa and obviously that's led to some growth,"" he said. ""But it's very early. As you can see, it's a big field, a lot of jostling. There will be a lot of ups and downs. So one more encouraging data point, but a part of a very, very long road.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pete d'Alessandro, a senior Iowa adviser to Sanders' campaign, said his candidate's push was happening due to their appeal to new, young voters.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're going to win here and we are successful because we can grow the electorate. We can grow the type of people that go to caucus,"" he said. ""That's where the strength is. It's also -- that anyone who's 21 to 17, because you can caucus at 17 in Iowa if you're going to be 18 by November. Those are both young people, which we appeal to, but there they're also new caucusgoers, because they didn't caucus last time. So they're part of the new people that we're bringing into it and, since we do well with them, that's part of expanding the universe because they'll be brand new caucusgoers."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll was conducted by Selzer &amp; Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, from June 2 through 5 among a random sample of 600 likely Democratic caucus participants reached on landlines or cell phones by a live interviewer.

The national press started to treat him seriously, and voters were then willing to give him a serious look. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The caucus has continued to demonstrate its potential to provide the much-vaunted momentum early on. In 2008, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama used his victory to undercut the inevitability of Sen. Hillary Clinton on his path to winning the nomination. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Carter and Obama aren't unique. Among Democrats, seven party nominees<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2016/01/31/465016222/how-predictive-are-iowa-and-new-hampshire"" target=""_blank""> have won</a> in Iowa since 1976. Meanwhile, candidates who have ignored Iowa, such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani in 2008, have sometimes suffered the consequences. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But does Iowa really matter as much as it used to? And can it provide the same kind of momentum that some underdog candidates have experienced?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The answer: probably not .</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And the truth is Iowa<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2016/01/31/465016222/how-predictive-are-iowa-and-new-hampshire"" target=""_blank""> has never been</a> the kingmaker it is believed to be. Presidents Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan won the presidency despite losing in Iowa.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The massive news media industrial complex has also been changing the importance of Iowa. Since the time that Carter won the state, the structure of the media has been altered dramatically. The era of three dominant television networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) and major metro newspapers has been replaced by 24-hour cable news, ongoing and instantaneous social media and a world of online journalism that is constantly updated and refreshed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With a massive infrastructure of news media covering stories and producing shows about the campaign, there will be many more opportunities than there were in 1976 for candidates to discover breakout moments. Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook and other forms of social media also provide ongoing windows to build momentum at any given moment (or for candidates to suddenly implode).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In short, Iowa has lost its monopoly. We have seen elements of this new dynamic with the town halls the cable networks have been airing. Take Buttigieg, who after participating in CNN and Fox News town halls and doing multiple television interviews, was able to take his candidacy from relative obscurity to political significance. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, in 2020, the potential momentum for an underdog from Iowa could potentially be checked by the pervasive and powerful sentiment that seems to be running through much of the Democratic electorate --<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/05/politics/democrats-2020-defeating-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank""> their first preference</a> as candidate is the person who has the best chance to defeat Trump. A come-from-behind underdog in the Iowa caucus still might not be as ""electable"" as Biden in the general election.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But a more immediate threat to Iowa's role comes from California, which has <a href=""https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/upcoming-elections/presidential-primary-election-march-3-2020/"" target=""_blank"">moved up its primary</a> to March 3 -- Super Tuesday -- with early voting starting on February 3, the same day of the Iowa caucus. Unlike Iowa, California looms large in the Democratic convention with<a href=""https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-california-primary-rules-story.html"" target=""_blank""> more than 400 Democratic delegates</a>. Given the dates and percentage of delegate differentials, it might be more interesting for candidates to shift their resources to the delegate-rich state for a bigger bounce. And to complicate matters further, Texas, <a href=""https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/13/beto-orourkes-texas-delegate-fight-shapes-hard-fought-democratic-race-president"" target=""_blank"">with its 262 delegates</a>, has also moved its primary to Super Tuesday. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, while the data out of Iowa is important, and a poor showing by Biden or extremely strong showing by one of the second-tier candidates could change the dynamics in the race, voters should remember that the times have changed dramatically since 1976 -- and it isn't clear that we are living in Carter's world anymore.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

They are largely wrong. In many cases, foreign leaders and citizens of the world alike have likely ""priced in"" Trump's erratic behavior and sidelined his pronouncements. If so, the result is a neutered presidency and an America that is safer because Trump is often not taken seriously.  </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">For decades, Presidents have played critical roles in international affairs -- from Richard Nixon's détente with China to Ronald Reagan's force of will that toppled communism to Jimmy Carter's brokered peace between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. In these and countless other examples, past Presidents advanced American interests and inspired the world by wielding both formal constitutional powers, as well as the authority granted by foreign leaders who accepted their statements as US policy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">This isn't the case with Trump, whose words foreign leaders can no longer take at face value. Fortunately, President Trump's incompetence in foreign relations, while not a cure-all, can moderate the damage that he might otherwise cause. The more exposure the world has to this President, the less he matters. After all, communication is a two-way street, and the audience plays a significant role in determining whether someone's words are accurate, meaningful, and safe to rely on.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Take, for example, Trump's rhetoric on North Korea. While the President recently said he is <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/trump-not-bothered-by-north-korea-s-recent-missile-test-launches"" target=""_blank"">not bothered by new North Korean missile tests</a> -- conflicting with the view of intelligence agencies -- he previously threatened nuclear attack (in his own way of course, by <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/03/trump-north-korea-nuclear-button-tweet-himes-reax-bts-ac.cnn"" target=""_blank"">claiming that his button is bigger than Kim's</a>).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In any prior administration, words such as these from the American President would place us at the precipice of war. But as norm-busting as they may be, we have become conditioned to view them as just the latest in an unbroken string of overheated comments. His words aren't newsworthy because they will all have real world consequences but because in many instances they won't -- despite being uttered by the leader of the free world, they are heavily discounted by the world just the same.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, how should foreign nations react if Trump renews his threats to pull out of NATO, makes further statements that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit/index.html"" target=""_blank"">praise leaders of corrupt regimes</a>, such as Russia's Vladimir Putin, or makes some other jaw-dropping pronouncement? Unless these leaders haven't been paying attention, they should temper any initial alarm by weighing these statements against often-contradictory commentary from other senior American officials, the State Department and the CIA. His track record shows that impulsive words may not result in action. Ultimately, despite Trump's rhetoric, the US has not pulled out of NATO, and it has levied sanctions on Russia. Moreover, routine rebukes of Trump's comments from foreign leaders reveal an international band of adults who are ready to sideline the US President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, as oddly comforting as Trump's lack of global credibility may be, it reflects a sorry state of affairs. This administration has luckily not faced an acute national security crisis, such as a 9/11-style terrorist attack or an imminent threat of war. As has been the case throughout our history, when such circumstances arise, America needs a reliable and respected leader to guide the nation. And the way in which the President acts in moments such as these could determine the course of human history.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">President John F. Kennedy's approach to the Cuban missile crisis likely averted war. Conversely, President George W. Bush's fixation on weapons of mass destruction (which were never found) led to war with Iraq, resulting in the deaths of thousands of US service members and a power vacuum filled by al Qaeda, the group from which<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html"" target=""_blank""> ISIS</a> was later formed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If faced with a national security crisis, Trump's incompetence could pose serious problems. The void of US leadership could also damage the US' global standing and push fledgling nations, such as Libya, to take their cues from Russia and China rather than from the United States. And then there's Trump's command over the nuclear arsenal, which is scary, given his penchant for tantrums. In a crisis, it's hard to know where Trump's impulses would lead the nation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's more, there have been instances when President Trump's words have foretold real policy movements with real-world consequences, such as his use of tariffs as an international trade tool with China and his threats of tariffs on Mexican goods in an effort to advance immigration-related ends. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But recognizing that he can cause damage does not mean that every oddball comment he makes will have a lasting impact. We are, for the time being, stuck with Trump and, fortunately, his incompetence has helped moderate what could otherwise be calamitous by spurring foreign leaders to ignore him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What if foreign leaders are inclined to take him seriously and react as if his words had meaning? It is both my belief and continued hope that President Trump's journey to irrelevancy on the world stage advances by the tweet, continuing to take further root so that we will soon see the day when it will not only be reasonable for world leaders to ignore Trump but it will be the only rational thing for them to do.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the international stage, the one constant in modern history is that the American President is taken seriously. This is one norm that we should all be thankful Trump has broken. And hopefully, it is a norm that can be quickly restored once he is out of office.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Two years after it launched, the group has gained a reputation, not as a financial powerhouse for a sitting president, but as an aimless operation struggling to deliver for Trump politically.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Interviews with six GOP operatives and donors reveal a deep frustration, not just over the group's spending habits, but also its lackluster fundraising. In the 2018 cycle, chairman and president Brian O. Walsh told CNN that America First and its affiliated non-profit together raised about $75 million, well short of its $100 million goal. About $39 million of that went to the super PAC, Federal Election Commission records show.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By comparison, the Republican National Committee raised more than $233 million in individual contributions in the same cycle. While America First's operating expenses appear to be within the normal realm for super PACs, critics say the money the group has raised has been misspent on large consulting contracts and high-cost events with little payoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last cycle, as Republicans were on their way to losing their House majority, America First was paying the equivalent of annual salaries to firms attached to Trump associates such as Sean Spicer, Katrina Pierson and Corey Lewandowski (a former CNN contributor), not to mention Clarke, fueling the perception that the group has become a safe harbor for various Trump cast-offs and family friends.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a perception that people who got fired from the administration or couldn't get administration jobs were just dumped there,"" says a Republican operative aligned with the President's re-election effort who has spoken with potential donors to America First. ""What fundraising they have done they've squandered on parties and other stupid things.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Trump prepares to officially kick off his re-election campaign this month, Republicans around Washington have started asking the same question: What, exactly, is the President's top super PAC doing? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New leadership</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After years of the President dismissing super PACs as a ""scam,"" the Trump campaign in a May 7 statement <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/politics/trump-2020-and-big-money/index.html"" target=""_blank"">endorsed America First</a> as the ""one approved outside, non-campaign group."" The embrace reflected the view among his political apparatus that Trump needed to point donors to a single independent vehicle, but some Republicans are questioning whether America First is up to the task. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been a disaster,"" said one GOP operative close to the Trump campaign. ""I mean, totally lackluster leadership.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brad Parscale, who helped launch America First's non-profit policy arm in late January 2017, left a year later <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/brad-parscale-donald-trump-2020/index.html"" target=""_blank"">to manage Trump's 2020 campaign</a>, taking Pierson with him as the campaign's senior adviser. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In February, America First's chairman, longtime Trump family friend Tommy Hicks, left to join the RNC as its co-chair. In April, Linda McMahon, the Small Business Administration chief, resigned her Cabinet post and came aboard as America First's chairwoman.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of McMahon, the former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and a two-time Republican senate candidate, is viewed by some skeptics as an acknowledgment of its past troubles. But so far the move has been welcomed by a number of donors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda McMahon joining America First marked a reset for them as they reload from the disastrous midterms to be Trump's wingman for a successful 2020 campaign,"" said Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based oil investor, Republican donor, and Trump supporter who gave $5,000 to America First in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Linda was brought in to see how to build confidence with the donor community and also to build a war chest to re-elect the president,"" says one Republican source.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked how fundraising has been going since she came on board, McMahon was upbeat about her conversations with donors. ""You have conversations, then you have follow-ups, then people come to the table,"" she told CNN. ""But all the initial responses that I am getting is that they are very delighted."" The next fundraising report to the FEC is due next month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Limited influence</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a super PAC, America First cannot contribute directly to a candidate's campaign or a party committee. It is limited to making ""independent expenditures"" -- advertisements, polling, and get-out-the-vote infrastructure -- and cannot coordinate with those candidates or campaigns. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But America First can also accept donations of any size from individuals, corporations, and other non-political organizations. That's what gives groups like it the chance to be ""super,"" and why some Republicans fear America First is failing to live up to its potential.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an interview with CNN, Walsh acknowledged the criticism that's been leveled at the group, but he pushed back on the idea America First hasn't delivered for the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We were active in '17 during the health care debate, and then we were active during tax reform. We did a lot of polling,"" Walsh said, pointing to 26 events with Vice President Mike Pence promoting tax reform.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But its influence was limited. Trump's tax cuts remain underwater in public approval. And Congress was unable to pass the White House-backed health care proposals while Republicans controlled the House.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First also paid for ads during the 2018 midterm elections on behalf of GOP congressional candidates, some of whom were in likely 2020 battleground states and others that were what Walsh called ""Trump Champions,"" or candidates who were particularly supportive of the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The group had a winning record in 2018 -- four of the six Senate candidates and seven of the 13 House candidates it backed won their races, including two House seats that flipped to the GOP, according to America First. Still, for the super PAC of a sitting president, America First wasn't much of a factor, a point that Walsh acknowledged. ""We were a supporting entity in the midterms, we will be a principal entity in the presidential,"" he told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>""Branding mechanisms""</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The biggest concern among Republicans is the super PAC's ""warehousing"" (as one Republican donor to the group put it) of figures from the broader Trump orbit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">America First has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""communications consulting"" to firms linked to people affiliated with Trump, including Lewandowski, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson, according to the group's public filing with the FEC. Spicer's public relations firm RigWil received more than $53,000 in the last six months of 2018, while Pierson's consulting firm was paid $60,000 between October 2017 and February 2018 before she left to join Trump's 2020 campaign.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two firms tied to Clarke, DAC Enterprises and Ranger Zuke, received a total of $120,000 from the super PAC between September 2017 and November 2018. Clarke had been turned down for multiple positions in the Trump administration before being named a senior advisor and spokesman for America First in September 2017. Clarke's association with the group ended last year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lewandowski's firm Green Monster Consulting, meanwhile, was paid $75,000 for ""strategy consulting"" over the nine months he was America First's senior advisor. He left in March 2018 to join Vice President Pence's Great America PAC. (""Let Trump Be Trump,"" the book Lewandowski wrote with fellow Trump campaign veteran David Bossie, is displayed behind the front desk of America First's 8th floor suite in a shiny new office building in Crystal City, Virginia.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked about their work for America First, Spicer, Clarke, and Pierson referred CNN to the group's spokeswoman, Kelly Sadler. Sadler said these associates of the President were employed as ""branding mechanisms"" to help ""establish ourselves as the Trump official PAC"" by making media appearances, signing small-dollar donor letters, and appearing at events.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walsh told CNN the super PAC does not plan on signing on any new surrogates. ""Now we only have Spicer,"" Walsh said. ""Spicer's kind of our principal person.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lewandowski did not respond to a request for comment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What have they been doing?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A month before McMahon took over, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/america-first-policies-mark-meadows-jim-jordan/index.html"" target=""_blank"">America First spent $100,000 on television ads</a> defending two stalwart Trump allies, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina. Both hail from strongly Republican districts and are in no danger of losing in 2020.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It's this kind of spending on safe candidates that has some Republicans around Washington scratching their heads. The GOP operative close with the Trump campaign called it ""general incompetence"" and a signal that a change in focus was necessary. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Republicans are hopeful that under McMahon, America First can transform from an open joke in GOP circles to the juggernaut it will need to be to help Trump win reelection.

Despite the anger of Trump's tweet, Baldwin again<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/trump-alec-baldwin-snl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> responded with humor</a>, tweeting, ""Agony though it may be, I'd like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But, recently, Baldwin's responses turned much more serious, expressing concern that Trump was trying to inspire someone to attack him or his family. In February 2019, Trump took to Twitter<a href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097116612279316480"" target=""_blank""> calling for ""retribution""</a> against ""SNL"" for mocking him: ""Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution?""  Trump then <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553"" target=""_blank"">added a tweet</a> minutes later, ""THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a reminder, this was just four months after self-professed Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc -- known as the ""MAGA bomber"" -- had <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/us/cesar-sayoc-guilty-plea/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sent explosive devices</a> to a variety of critics of Trump, from Hillary Clinton to CNN. Perhaps that (and Trump's tweets) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/1097319232151449600"" target=""_blank"">explain Baldwin's response</a>: ""I wonder if a sitting President exhorting his followers that my role in a TV comedy qualifies me as an enemy of the people constitutes a threat to my safety and that of my family?"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, just because Baldwin won't play Trump anymore does not mean that ""SNL"" will stop mocking the President. But has Trump succeeded in diminishing the visibility of the show by possibly driving out an award-winning actor who will be replaced by someone less known -- given that ""SNL"" is typically a platform for up-and-coming talent?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another apparent victory for Trump in his war on comedy involves the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) annual dinner, which for years featured a comedian who roasted the President. That is, until this year's dinner in April, when instead they <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-is-the-white-house-correspondents-association-doing-trumps-bidding"" target=""_blank"">featured historian Ron Chernow</a>. To many, it appeared the WHCA had yielded to Trump's demands after he took to Twitter to not only lash out at comedian Michelle Wolf,  who had mocked his administration at last year's dinner, but also called for the WHCA to change the dinner's format of featuring a comic: ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/990782291667488768"" target=""_blank"">Put Dinner to rest, or start over!</a>"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To be clear, Trump's war on comedy predates his run for president. For example, in 2013, Trump<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675"" target=""_blank""> sued Bill Maher</a> for $5 million for making a joke that Trump is ""the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan."" (He later withdrew the lawsuit.) And over the years, Trump has<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/opinions/trump-losing-war-on-comedy-obeidallah/index.html"" target=""_blank""> angrily lashed out</a> against comedians Jon Stewart and Seth Meyers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But never before has Trump appeared to have won even one skirmish in this war on comedy -- until now. We can debate the role Trump played in Baldwin ending his ""SNL"" run or the WHCA no longer featuring a comedian. But clearly these are developments Trump wanted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hope is that Trump never wins another battle in this war. Comedy has long been used in America to expose the faults of people in power, especially presidents. We cannot allow comedy to be silenced or infringed upon in any way simply because Trump is too thin skinned to take a joke.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

But not everyone is buying it. <strong>Ross Garber</strong>, who has defended four governors in impeachment proceedings, wrote that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/opinions/nancy-pelosis-weird-and-wrong-views-about-impeachment-garber/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Pelosi's focus on an eventual criminal case is an abdication of the House's constitutional responsibility</a>, and is just one of what he called her ""weird (and wrong)"" views on the topic.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""><strong>Michael Zeldin</strong> and <strong>Julian Zelizer</strong> pointed to three prime instances where Mueller's report lays out evidence of potential obstruction of justice that the House could consider in deciding whether to launch an impeachment inquiry. If Mueller had had the sweeping power granted by the now-defunct independent counsel law to Kenneth Starr, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/opinions/mueller-option-zeldin-zelizer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">he might well have already referred such evidence to Congress</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some Democrats argue that impeachment would give them a powerful weapon to crack the White House's stonewall, which has blocked testimony from key Trump aides. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Monday, the House Judiciary Committee is holding a hearing on Mueller's findings. But instead of those who can answer questions about their experience in the Trump orbit, the featured witness is John Dean, the former White House counsel whose testimony helped end Richard Nixon's presidency and who is now a CNN contributor. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has been nearly seven weeks since the Mueller report became public,"" <strong>Elie Honig </strong>noted. ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/opinions/hope-hicks-testimony-critical-house-judiciary-committee-honig/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Congress has obtained exactly zero testimony from firsthand witnesses</a> about the facts set forth in the report.

The President's fascination with the royals and his decision to bring his adult children along for the ride flies in the face of centuries of American skepticism about hereditary monarchs, <strong>Kate Maltby </strong>wrote. Trump told interviewers he wanted to see a ""next generation"" meeting between his children and the younger British royals. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If Donald Trump really wanted his children to become like British royals,"" Maltby wrote, ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/opinions/trump-royal-family-state-visit-maltby/index.html"" target=""_blank"">he'd need to teach them the distinctly Windsor art of giving up power gracefully.</a> British royals never comment on politics -- and they don't even run their own Twitter accounts.

I hope she is OK. ..."" he said.) Trump later responded to Pelosi's prison comment by saying, ""She's a nasty, vindictive, horrible person.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why do Trump's remarks about women deserve the scrutiny they get?

Richard Carter was a 20-year-old American serving as a radio operator aboard<strong> </strong>Madame X, a B-17 bomber based in Britain and part of a wave of US aircraft that helped prepare the way for the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Carter and his comrades, his son,<strong> Bill Carter</strong>, wrote for CNN Opinion, ""had signed up to serve their country in what they understood was a war for the survival of freedom. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/opinions/d-day-anniversary-dad-hero-carter/index.html"" target=""_blank"">It wasn't a sophisticated or complicated choice they were making; it wasn't even really a choice.

And finally, he told a roomful of Democrats in a speech in Atlanta that he would indeed favor getting rid of it. <strong>SE Cupp</strong> warned that changing his stance was a mistake for a candidate who once described his position on abortion as ""middle of the road.""

Lawmakers have said the <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3012611/no-guarantee-fair-trial-hong-kong-extradition-bill"" target=""_blank"">guarantee</a> of a fair trial will not be written into the bill.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sunday afternoon, protesters gathered at Victoria Park in central Hong Kong, waving placards and wearing white -- the designated color of the rally.

Officers urged protesters to disperse. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The protest was mostly peaceful during the day, but it turned violent overnight, with police trying to clear protesters with batons.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands also gathered to protest the extradition bill in cities across Australia on Sunday. Similar marches were planned in other cities around the world, Hong Kong political group Demosisto said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At about 10.30 p.m. (10.30 a.m. ET), organizers announced that the protest had ended. CNN journalists on the ground said the bulk of the protesters had dispersed by then, leaving a number of people milling around the Legislative Council. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late Sunday, the government of Hong Kong released a statement acknowledging the ongoing protests across the island but reiterating the contested bill is still scheduled to resume debate June 12.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We urge the Legislative Council to scrutinize the Bill in a calm, reasonable and respectful manner to help ensure Hong Kong remains a safe city for residents and business,"" it said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Murder of tourist </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The case for the bill was expedited by a grisly murder case in Taiwan, where a 20-year-old Hong Kong woman was allegedly killed by her boyfriend while on holiday there. Currently, the suspect cannot be sent from Hong Kong to face justice in Taiwan.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, Taipei has already said it will refuse to cooperate with the new law if it puts Taiwanese citizens at risk of being extradited to China. The self-ruled island has previously seen citizens accused of crimes in countries that do not recognize Taiwan diplomatically being <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/asia/taiwan-kenya-deportations/index.html"" target=""_blank"">handed to Chinese custody</a>, despite objections of Taipei.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this week, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, slammed the bill.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People have known exactly why there shouldn't be an extradition agreement with China for years,"" Patten said in a <a href=""https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/06/video-last-colonial-governor-hong-kong-chris-patten-says-govt-defence-extradition-bill-absolute-nonsense/"" target=""_blank"">video</a> message Thursday.

Members of the US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) have also <a href=""https://www.cecc.gov/media-center/press-releases/cecc-commissioners-send-letter-to-hong-kong-chief-executive-carrie-lam"" target=""_blank"">spoken out</a> against the bill, warning Lam it could ""negatively impact the relationship between the United States and Hong Kong.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Unwanted and unneeded? </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Business groups in Hong Kong usually take a neutral stance on contentious political issues. But this time they, too, have spoken out against the bill. In a bid to secure their support, the government has limited the scope of extraditable offenses -- but for some that is still not enough. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong <a href=""https://www.amcham.org.hk/news/press-release-proposed-fugitive-offenders-ordinance"" target=""_blank"">warned</a> last week there were ""too many uncertainties in fundamental sections of the proposed legislation"" for it to be passed in its current form. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hong Kong is not ready to see this bill passed and we do not see why it should be rushed through when the loophole it seeks to address has existed for 20 years,"" the chamber said in a statement. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But government spokesman Matthew Cheung said the move was time sensitive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The suspect in the Taiwan murder case is serving sentences for other criminal offenses in Hong Kong but is expected to be released this October,"" Cheung said. ""There is thus a pressing need to provide a legal basis for the assistance that we want to render to Taiwan, before the (legislature) goes into summer recess from mid-July to October."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cheung did not address Taipei's concerns over the bill. Separately, Lam <a href=""https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2019/06/20190604/20190604_103434_978.html"" target=""_blank"">said</a> it was ""unfounded"" to suggest the Hong Kong government ""will just follow the instructions given by the Central Government and surrender whatever fugitives that the Central Government wants."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A US State Department spokesperson said Washington is ""concerned by the Hong Kong government's proposed amendments to its Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, which would allow for individuals to be transferred to mainland China at the request of Communist Party authorities, and is closely monitoring the situation.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Societies are best served when diverse political views are respected and can be freely expressed,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""Continued erosion of the 'One country, Two systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Fierce opposition </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The extradition bill, particularly an attempt to fast-track it through Hong Kong's semi-democratic Legislature, has reinvigorated the city's flagging opposition movement after numerous setbacks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Organizers claimed 130,000 people took part in a protest against the bill <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/asia/hk-protest-extradition-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">in April</a>. While police gave the lower figure of 22,800, it was still the biggest protest since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, an ultimately unsuccessful protest over political reform which shut down parts of the city for months. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fears over the bill -- and criticism from a broad swath of Hong Kong society -- echo 2003, when half a million people took to the streets to oppose the passage of an anti-sedition law. That legislation was shelved, but the issue has become such a hot-button topic in Hong Kong that -- despite promising to do so -- no governments since have attempted to introduce it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sunday's protest comes days after the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/asia/tiananmen-june-4-china-censorship-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre</a>, a pivotal moment that dashed hopes China would democratize before it took control of Hong Kong in 1997. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hong Kong has commemorated the massacre with a candlelit vigil ever since, the only place on Chinese soil where mass remembrances are held. Organizers said more than 180,000 people joined a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/asia/gallery/tiananmen-square-30th-anniversary-hong-kong-vigil/index.html"" target=""_blank"">vigil in the city's Victoria Park on Tuesday</a>, the largest such event since the 25th anniversary in 2014, which came in the politically fraught run-up to the Umbrella protests. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the number of people who participated in protests in Hong Kong on Sunday.

News outlets have covered the last known moments of a<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/us/missing-americans-dominican-republic-identification/index.html"" target=""_blank""> New York couple</a> that vanished and was later found dead in the Dominican Republic, detailed the final conversations that a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/06/us/carla-stefaniak-costa-rica-tourist-death/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Florida woman</a> who was murdered in Costa Rica had with her family, and published the travel photos of a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/18/world/north-carolina-teacher-killed-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">North Carolina teacher</a> who was murdered while backpacking in Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the quiet struggles of the families of travelers who go missing have gotten less attention. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Chasing her dream in Peru</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At 35 years old, Carla is a legally blind woman who has traveled extensively -- in part to show that she couldn't be defined by her disability, and in part to see as much of the world as she could before completely losing her sight. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By December 2018, Carla had traveled to about 20 countries by herself. She had studied Arabic in Egypt, worked with abandoned children in Yemen and traveled to remote villages in Indonesia to advocate for indigenous women. Her family said she had always dreamed of visiting Peru, but she hadn't gotten the chance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When her friend, Alicia Garcia Steele, told her she was going to travel to Lima to be the maid of honor at a wedding, Carla jumped at the opportunity to go with her. Carla's mom helped her pick out a navy blue dress and a pair of beige ballerina flats for the wedding.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After taking a bus and two plane rides from Detroit, Carla and Garcia Steele arrived in the bustling capital of Lima just in time to help with last-minute wedding details. They would later dance all night at the reception and celebrate Carla's birthday on the beach. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the last stretch of their two-week trip, Carla planned to travel alone to hike Machu Picchu, even after her friend advised her not to go by herself.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The day Carla left for her Machu Picchu trip, Garcia Steele grew nervous and kept texting her as the hours passed. She provided CNN with screengrabs of the messages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla are you there?""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla I'm so worried and have not heard anything from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Is everything ok?!?!""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Please please please write me when you can.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla. How are you. I'm dying to hear from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla replied -- more than 12 hours later -- she apologized, blaming the lack of Wi-Fi and her packed travel itinerary. Garcia Steele was glad to hear that Carla was OK, but something else in that text alarmed her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""I had a big issue that I need to resolve that I'll do it before I get home,""</em> Carla wrote. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This was one of the last times Garcia Steele would hear from her.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her friends and relatives were unable to reach her for a few days. They didn't panic until Carla missed her flight back to the United States.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her mom had just moved cross-country for her</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria, 66, had been living in Detroit for only a few months when Carla traveled to Peru. When Maria retired from her job as a victims' advocate for the Kendall County District Attorney in Texas, Carla asked her mom to move in with her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria suspected her daughter's eyesight was worsening. Carla suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that causes a person's vision to deteriorate over time. After she was diagnosed at age 10, her mother pushed her to learn Braille and other skills that would prepare her to be fully blind. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla became very independent, living by herself, walking and biking around the city. She rarely talked about her blindness, and it was even more unusual for her to ask her mom for help. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within weeks of moving to Detroit to be with her daughter, Maria had learned all aspects of Carla's busy schedule: Her 6 a.m. trips to the gym, her work shift as a docent at the Arab American National Museum, the English as a Second Language classes she taught at a community center. Carla would write her plans on a whiteboard hanging in the entryway of their home, and if something changed, Carla would call her mom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's excitement about visiting Machu Picchu was palpable in her texts and the sound of her voice.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'll be thinking about you when I'm there,"" Maria remembered her daughter telling her during their last phone call on December 10.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A seasoned traveler quietly vanishes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After the wedding, Carla joined a group of Spanish and Argentinian travelers to hike Huayna Picchu, the steep mountain overlooking the famed ruins, and they returned together to Cusco a few hours later. The group -- still feeling the adrenaline rush -- had dinner together and danced for hours at a club before finally settling at a hostel for the night. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I can't wait to tell you all about it. It was absolutely worth 100%,"" she wrote to Garcia Steele in her last message to her on the night of December 11.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While her newfound friends were still asleep the next morning, her family said, a surveillance camera caught Carla taking a cab by herself outside the hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She didn't share her plans with anyone, her family said, but there is no doubt that she planned to come back. Before leaving, she sent a message to a friend saying she would be back in a few hours to hopefully visit some museums. She also left behind two bags with souvenirs, her medicine and her jacket.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later police would learn that she had taken two cabs. The first driver dropped Carla off at a Cusco street where people ride shared taxis headed to the Sacred Valley. The other driver said Carla was in his collective taxi and that she got off in the valley's first village -- Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>He left Texas behind to search the Peruvian Andes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father had been replacing the windows of an old home in Comfort, Texas, when he learned his daughter was missing -- three days after she was last seen. He booked a flight to Peru and drove 40 miles to the San Antonio airport to catch an eight-hour flight to Lima. From there, he flew over an hour to Cusco, and a police escort drove him for 40 minutes to Pisac through the curvy mountain roads of the Sacred Valley.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When he arrived in Pisac, he quickly learned that locals don't trust police. He spent days getting to know the residents of the town, and the people who regularly sell handcrafts in the main square and outside the park's entrance. They were and are still cordial with him, but he's not sure if they will ever trust him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has really been a nightmare since the beginning, a total nightmare,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He walked through the narrow cobbled streets of the colonial village looking for surveillance cameras, only to find a handful. Magnifying his exasperation, most of those cameras erase their footage every five days or so. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It had taken police more than a week to track down the information about the cab drivers who had taken her on the journey to Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What happened to Carla?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A camera outside a drugstore in Pisac captured the last known image of Carla. It shows her walking quickly with her green daypack and her silver folding cane for 14 seconds, about an hour after she left her hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She was heading in the direction of the Pisac Archaeological Park, a 9,063-hectare (22,395 acre) mountainside historic site known for its Incan ruins, tunnels, and massive agricultural terraces. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla's dad walked around the village's main square asking about his daughter, a woman selling traditional clothing and an employee of the local tourism information office said Carla had asked them for directions to the park. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A park employee later told police he saw Carla walking toward the entrance, but the park's ticket-taker couldn't confirm that. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, police pursued the theory that something had happened to Carla in the park, and that someone had hidden her body, or wild animals had devoured it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They flew drones over the park, sent in cadaver dogs and rescue teams, but they found nothing, said Peru National Police Colonel Carlos Manuel Valer Cruces, the man leading the investigation into Carla's disappearance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A team of Peruvian police detectives that handle missing persons and homicide cases are currently working together to find Carla, along with a special prosecutor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police now believe that Carla never made it into the park. They believe someone took or lured her to one of the many ritual sites in the region where tourists try an intensely hallucinogenic -- and sometimes deadly -- potion known as ayahuasca. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's family disputes that she would have wanted to take drugs. They believe Carla was sexually assaulted, kidnapped or was the victim of either human or organ trafficking. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I have no doubt in my mind that my sister was the victim of a crime,"" her brother said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Looking for his sister became his second job</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. and Carla -- born 11 months apart -- had the same friends growing up, went to the same schools in Texas and spent hours tubing on the Guadalupe River, talking about their future.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As his dad flew to Peru to search for his sister, Carlos studied maps of the Cusco region and answered dozens of phone calls from people reporting sightings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are not sleeping, you are not eating, you are not showering. You are just working constantly,"" Carlos Jr., 34, said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He can't leave his wife and months-old son -- or his job at a design fabrication studio -- indefinitely, but he has traveled to Peru from his home in Brooklyn, New York, at least three times, staying for weeks at a time to help his dad. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It just never feels like it's enough,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It makes you feel rotten inside that you can't grieve, you can't cry, you can't--"" he said, sobbing. ""You can't be there for your son, for your wife, because you have to do the job of the police.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She's not the only one missing</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An ocean away from the Valpeoz family, a woman heard about Carla's disappearance and burst into tears. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alexandra Ayala Leon, who lives in Seville, Spain, had never met Carla or anyone who knew her. But her own daughter had vanished in the same region of Peru, nearly a year before. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two men were arrested a few weeks after 28-year-old Nathaly Salazar Ayala went missing. They claimed she had died in a zip line accident and that they dumped her body in a river, yet her body has never been located.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ayala Leon felt helpless knowing another family was living through the same nightmare.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would not want them to suffer the same pain. Unfortunately, they're going through the same (situations) we experienced,"" said Ayala Leon, 49.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In long phone conversations with the Valpeoz family, Ayala Leon has guided them while they navigate through red tape, deal with calls from shamans looking to take advantage of them and look for experts to help in Carla's search. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She and Alisa Clamen of Canada, whose 22-year-old son, Jesse Galganov, disappeared while backpacking in the Peruvian mountains in 2017, have become like a second family for Carla's brother. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The pain is the same, different circumstances, but the pain is still there,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""I could never repay them for the amount of love, support and information that they've given me.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her family feels abandoned</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. has spent countless hours asking US politicians and the State Department to get more involved in finding his sister.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A lot of times it's really, really tough to get somebody on the other side of the line,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""Sometimes I have to wait days to get a phone call back.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""My family feels like we are just being abandoned,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US Embassy officials continue telling the family they don't have jurisdiction in Peru to search for Carla. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A State Department spokesperson declined to discuss Carla's case, citing privacy considerations, and said the agency was ""aware of media reports of a US citizen missing in Cusco."" The spokesperson also referred all inquiries on the investigation to Peruvian authorities. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When a US citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts. The US Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater responsibility than the protection of US citizens overseas,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father walks every other day to the police station in Cusco, trying to make sure Peruvian authorities are actively searching for his daughter. He's shared potential sightings and other tips from locals, but he can't be sure if detectives will act on them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Valer Cruces, the man leading the police investigation, said that US authorities have not offered local police any specific assistance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Their lives are changed forever</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Soon after Carla disappeared, Maria realized she couldn't stay in Detroit. She started to notice that everywhere she went -- the bank, the supermarket -- people recognized her and they stared at her with sadness. And she imagined she saw her daughter everywhere -- standing at every bus stop, walking on the streets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A few days after Christmas, she packed a small bag and traveled to Brooklyn. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, Maria fell asleep every night on the pink couch in her son's apartment, holding her daughter's grey knit sweater. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She can't find Carla herself, she said, but she can support her son and her husband while they look for her. She spends her days making baby purees from scratch and playing with her grandson. She has been paying off Carla's student loans and other bills, and recently had to go through Carla's possessions alone in preparation for selling her house.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now she's waiting for Carla in a small Brooklyn apartment that her son secured for her. Near her bed, she keeps a pocket-sized velvet picture frame with childhood photos of her children, alongside an image of the Virgin Mary.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since Carla disappeared, Carlos Jr. has celebrated his wife's birthday, takes any chance he gets to play with his son, and has started a new tradition with his mom: they'll stop by their neighborhood diner to eat cheeseburgers once a week.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm really trying to fill my life with things to do with my family,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""But at the end, I'm always thinking about Carla, the investigation, my dad, my mom. I can't escape it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands of miles away, Carlos Sr. wakes up every morning before sunrise ready to keep searching for Carla. He doesn't mind wearing the same few changes of clothes for weeks, the sickening altitude or the brutal sun. He'll be right there, far from home and alone, whether someone breaks their silence and calls police, whether his daughter's remains are found, or his prayers are answered and he is able to hug his daughter one more time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I need to take my daughter back,"" Valpeoz said. ""I need to find her somehow.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Her captor allowed her to leave the apartment once every six months. Attempts to escape had failed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Lee's story is shared by thousands of North Korean girls and women, some as young as nine years old, who are being abducted or trafficked to work in China's multimillion-dollar sex trade, according to a <a href=""https://www.koreafuture.org/report/sex-slaves"" target=""_blank"">report</a> by the London-based non-profit organization Korea Future Initiative (KFI). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">North Korean women are often enslaved in brothels, sold into repressive marriages or made to perform graphic acts in front of webcams in satellite towns near cities close to China's border with North Korea, the KFI found. If caught by the Chinese authorities, they face repatriation to North Korea where defectors are often tortured. CNN was not able to independently verify claims made in the report.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee, however, had just found a lifeline. The stranger the 28-year-old was talking to online was not a cybersex customer.

I'm afraid.""   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Escape from North Korea</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are no official statistics showing exactly how many North Koreans have fled their country, which is home to about 25 million <a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kn.html"" target=""_blank"">people</a>.

""They are in charge of the household and can thus slip away unnoticed.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee grew up in a family of low-level party cadres in North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We had enough food,"" she said. ""We even had rice and wheat stored in the garage."" But Lee felt her parents were too strict. ""I had to be home before sundown and they didn't allow me to study medicine.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One day, after getting into a fight with them, she decided to cross the border into China. Lee said she found a broker to facilitate the dangerous move who promised her a job in a restaurant.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That promise turned out to be a lie. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Usually, women like Lee pay brokers $500 to $1,000 to organize their safe passage to China, according to NGOs and defector accounts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To reach China, many defectors cross the Tumen River that separates North Korea from China on foot at night, sometimes in freezing weather with the water coming up to their shoulders.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, border security was tightened to avoid the bad publicity associated with defections and prevent information about North Korea trickling into the country, according to Tim Peters, an American pastor who co-founded an NGO called Helping Hands that helps defectors flee. An electric fence was added, as well as cameras at the border.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""On the Chinese side, patrols were also increased because Beijing is afraid an influx of refugees could destabilize its own regime,"" he added.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>North Korea is visible from Yanji in China. </em> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two huge portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hang at the entrance of a bridge linking the two countries.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once on Chinese soil, defectors must reach the city of Tumen that sits right up against the icy river, in a lunar landscape of barren hills. North Korea is visible from the town -- farmers in a village there can be seen ploughing their fields with antique machinery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee crossed the Tumen River in a group of eight girls.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When she arrived in China, Lee said she was taken to a flat on the fourth floor of a pale yellow building in Yanji, a city in Jilin province about 50 kilometers from Tumen, where most signs are written in Korean and Chinese and scores of restaurants sell bibimbap and kimchi, due to the large population of ethnic Koreans.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the apartment, she realized there was no restaurant job.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Instead, Lee said her broker had sold her for 30,000 yuan (about $4,500) to the operator of a cybersex chatroom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When I found out, I felt so humiliated,"" she whispered. ""I started crying and asked to leave, but the boss said he had paid a lot of money for me and I now had a debt towards him.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Korean NGOs estimate that 70% to 80% of North Korean women who make it to China are trafficked, for between 6,000 and 30,000 yuan ($890 to $4,500), depending on their age and beauty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some are sold as brides to Chinese farmers; more recently, girls have increasingly been trafficked into the cybersex industry, according to the KFI.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rising wages in northern China cities have led to a greater demand for prostitutes among the male population, according to the KFI report. In southern China, trafficked women from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has typically met that demand. But in northeastern provinces, men have turned to North Korean refugees.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A spokesperson for the Chinese government said in a statement to CNN: ""I want to stress that the Chinese government pays high attention to foreign citizens' legitimate rights according to law, also combat activities of human trafficking women and child.""   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Michael Glendinning, director of the KFI, said the Chinese government was ""not doing enough to protect North Korean women and girls in its territory at all.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""China must work to crack down on the networks and individuals -- including Chinese public officials -- responsible for the trafficking of North Korean women and girls, he said. ""But it must do so in a way that ensures that these women and girls are not repatriated to North Korea where they would face torture, imprisonment, and possibly extrajudicial killing.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two other North Korean women already lived in the two-bedroom apartment Lee was delivered to. One was 27 years old, had her own bedroom and seemed close to the chatroom boss.

Kwang was 19 years old and had been locked up for two years when Lee arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""My parents split up when I was very young and I grew up with my mother and grandparents,"" she said.

""Both my mother and my grandmother had cancer and needed treatment,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But all the money Kwang earned in China went to her captor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee and Kwang had to share a room. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The only furniture was two beds, two tables and two computers,"" recalled Kwang. ""Every morning, I would get up around 11 a.m., have breakfast and then start working until dawn the next day."" Sometimes, she would only get four hours of sleep. If they complained, they would get beaten, although both women said they did not suffer sexual abuse by their captor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Work involved logging onto an online chat platform on which South Korean men can pay to watch girls perform sexual acts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes of logging on to the site, users are barraged by women on the platform sending text messages asking for a video chat in a private room.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They all claim to be from a major city in South Korea. The minimum price to chat on the site is 150 won (13 cents), but girls can set the entry price for a room, with popular accounts tending to have a more expensive entry fee. Tips start at a minimum of 300 won (25 cents), but can go far higher as customers try to persuade the girls to fulfill their requests. Lee and Kwang were tasked by their captors with keeping the men online for as long as possible. In South Korea, where prostitution is illegal, these services have become increasingly popular in recent years. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">CNN reached out to the platform to ask what steps it takes to protect women like Lee and Kwang on its site, but the company did not respond.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Some of the men just wanted to talk, but most wanted more,"" said Lee, with a shudder of disgust. ""They would ask me to take suggestive poses or to undress and touch myself. I had to do everything they asked."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I felt like dying 1,000 times, but I couldn't even kill myself as the boss was always watching us,"" she said.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her captor was a man of South Korean descent who slept in the living room to keep a close eye on the women.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The front door was always locked from the outside and there was no handle on the inside,"" said Kwang. ""Every six months, he would take us out to the park.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On this small patch of green next to their flat, retirees would meet to dance to music each afternoon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""During those outings, he would always stay right next to us, so we never got to talk to anyone,"" said Lee. In 2015, Lee tried to escape by climbing out of a window and down a metal drain, but she fell and hurt her back and leg. She still limps slightly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When their captor wanted something from the girls, he would try to sweet-talk them, promising a cut of their earnings or to let them go free to work in South Korea one day.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when Kwang asked for a piece of the 60 million won (around $51,000) she estimated she had made for him, he got angry.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He started kicking, slapping and cursing me,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During the seven years Kwang spent locked up in his flat, she said he never gave her a cent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3> A ray of light</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was during the summer of 2018 that Lee finally saw her chance to escape.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""One of my customers realized I was North Korean and was being held captive,"" said Lee. While most men probably knew the girls weren't South Korean, because North Koreans have different accents and dialects to people in the south, they chose to look the other way.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This man was different.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He bought a laptop and let me take control of the screen remotely, so I could send messages without my boss noticing,"" Lee said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The man also gave her the phone number of a South Korean pastor named Chun Ki-Won.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Chun, a mild mannered man with high cheekbones and wavy grey hair, is one of a band of Korean pastors who specialize in helping North Korean women escape from China. Chun said his Christian aid organization, Durihana, has helped over 1,000 defectors reach Seoul since 1999. Korean media has nicknamed him the Asian <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/seoultrain/activists.html"" target=""_blank"">Schindler</a>, after the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In the past few years, dozens of missionaries linked to my organization have been deported from China,"" he said from his Seoul office that overflowed with plants, books and religious figurines. ""There are only a few left and they have to stay on the move constantly to avoid being arrested.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">China is a close ally of Pyongyang and doesn't consider North Korean defectors refugees, instead seeing them as <a ""="""" href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg74809/html/CHRG-112hhrg74809.htm "" target=""_blank"">illegal</a> economic migrants. ""When it catches them, it sends them back (to North Korea), where they face torture, internment in a labor camp and sometimes death,"" said Lee Eunkoo, the co-founder of Teach North Korean Refugees, an NGO that helps defectors learn English.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In September 2018, Lee contacted Pastor Chun on KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging service. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hi, I want to go to South Korea. Can you help me?"" read the first message she sent.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over the following weeks, Lee explained to Chun how she had ended up in a cybersex chatroom. He asked her about the flat's layout and her boss' comings and goings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By mid-October a plan had been hatched: Chun would send a team to Yanji to extract Lee and Kwang.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On October 26, while Yumi's boss was away for the day, Durihana's members arrived at the foot of the building. The two girls knotted their bedsheets together and dropped them out of their window. The extraction team then tied a rope to the sheets, which the girls pulled up and used to lower themselves safely to the ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They were only able to take a small backpack with a couple of essentials -- a pack of wet wipes and a comb. They jumped into a car and sped away.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The whole operation took minutes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Journey to the south</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Korean pastors have set up a network of routes and safe houses in China inspired by the Underground Railroad, the secret passages enslaved African-Americans used to escape to free states from the late 1700s until the US Civil War.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Each individual cell knows nothing about the other ones, to avoid compromising the whole operation if one of them gets caught,"" said Tim Peters, the American pastor living in Seoul who is helping North Koreans flee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before 1998, defectors would simply knock on the door of the South Korean consulate general in Shenyang, the capital of neighboring Liaoning province, around 790 kilometers (490 miles) from the border with North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But during the Sunshine Policy era (1998 to 2008), which saw a rapprochement between Seoul and Pyongyang, several refugees were deported to North Korea from the Shenyang consulate, according to the book ""Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia's Underground Railroad"" by Melanie Kirkpatrick. Defectors then started crossing the Gobi desert into Mongolia, aiming to reach the South Korean embassy in the capital. But that route closed in 2010, when Ulaanbaatar reinstated strong diplomatic links with North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The only option left was to go south through China, hoping to reach a country that wouldn't send North Korean refugees home.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After escaping Yanji, Lee and Kwang said they went across China on buses and trains using fake Korean passports. Their last stop was Kunming, in China's deep southwest. From there, most defectors cross the border illegally into Laos or Myanmar and either head for the South Korean embassy in the capital cities of those countries, or continue to Bangkok, in Thailand. CNN has not revealed which country Lee and Kwang traveled to for security reasons.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee and Kwang met with a Chinese man who took them across the mountains into a neighboring country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We walked for five hours through the jungle, before reaching a road where a car was waiting for us,"" said Kwang. Chun later met them in the middle of the night on the side of a road. ""I burst into tears as soon as I saw him,"" said Kwang, who is now 24 years old. ""For the first time in a very long time, I felt safe.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After two more days of traveling by car and bus, they reached the capital city. ""We were stopped several times by the police for routine checks, I was terrified,"" said Kwang.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In total, they said their journey from Kunming took 50 hours.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As they rode towards the embassy in a tuk tuk, Lee stared giddily at the urban landscape unfolding before her eyes. ""I'm so happy!"" she said, as the embassy approached. Kwang was more nervous. ""I know I should feel joy, but I just feel empty,"" she said. ""I don't know what to expect and I am afraid of the interrogations at the embassy.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At 5.30 p.m., the two defectors and Chun walked up to the black and golden gate of Seoul's diplomatic representation. Before they had a chance to ring the bell, they said a man in a black shirt opened the door and ushered them inside with a smile.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A few minutes later, Chun walked out -- alone.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The embassy, which receives about 10 defectors a month, according to officials, kept the women for about 10 days for questioning. Those who satisfy the questioning process will fly to freedom in South Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Upon arrival in South Korea, defectors spend three months at Hanawon, a processing center where they learn how to navigate staples of modern life such as taking the subway, getting cash from an ATM or buying groceries in a supermarket. They are then provided with a South Korean passport, a subsidized flat and the right to enroll at a university for free.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before entering the South Korean embassy, Lee had given her new life a lot of thought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to study English and Chinese and maybe become a teacher,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kwang, who had left school at 12, hoped to graduate.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I never really had the luxury of wondering what to do with my life,"" she said.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Jake Kwon also contributed to this report.</p>]"

When he and LoEshé were kids, he'd go over to her house to play.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But from the start, Smith had a very different upbringing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""As early as I can remember, it was a dysfunctional family and unstable household. That was my world,"" Smith said. ""Every time I woke up in the morning, every time I went outside, that's what I was consumed with -- the dysfunction in my family.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He says he and his siblings were often left to fend for themselves. When his parents split up, Smith moved from the homes of cousins and friends into foster care, where he says he continued to experience abuse and neglect. He was 13 when he was convicted of his first crime -- theft -- and after serving a few weeks at juvenile hall, Smith learned his foster mother had told his public defender that she wouldn't take him back.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For Smith, the rejection was too much for his adolescent mind to comprehend.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I broke,"" he said. ""It was like my world just caved in on me. At that point, I had given up completely on everything.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Smith became a part of Oakland's ""Ghost Town"" gang as he cycled in and out of group homes, sometimes running away for weeks at a time to join his fellow gang members. That's where he was on October 20, 1997.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Smith says there had been a lot of shootings back and forth between rival gangs. And on that Monday, Smith got a call that one of his best friends had been shot. Up to that point, Smith had stood on the sidelines of the gang wars. Now all eyes were on him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I went into a panic,"" Smith said. ""Everyone was kind of looking at me, like, 'You're riding around, you're hanging out with us, you're here ... but what you gonna do?' ... This was my thinking at the time, that If I go and kill someone for my gang, then I would be accepted into a whole other family. A family that will love me, a family that will care for me, a family that will never leave me.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That night, he and three other Ghost Town members drove the streets of west Oakland. Smith says they were essentially on a hunt, searching for rival gang members to shoot and kill. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They spotted a tan 1975 Dodge van parked near McClymonds High School, a car they thought was driven by one of their intended targets. Smith says they parked, walked up to the vehicle and opened fire. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Dozens of shots rang out.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What Smith says he didn't know was that LoEshé Lacy was also inside that van. She'd caught a ride home after finishing her part-time shift at McDonald's, and they'd stopped to listen to music when the gunfire began. Bullets struck her in the head and the neck. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The next morning, Smith learned that he'd killed his childhood friend. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At first, Donald Lacy wasn't above revenge.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He was getting calls from people who said they knew who killed his daughter, and they'd be happy to handle it for him. But then he remembered the example LoEshé had set months before as she dealt with her own loss.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""So I put the word out. ... I don't want any retaliation,"" Lacy said. ""I hadn't forgiven at that point, but I didn't want that sullied, negative energy on my daughter's memory or death.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The killing shook the city of Oakland and was front-page news in the Bay Area.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After weeks of interrogation, Smith confessed. He was 16, and was sentenced with 20 years to life.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the next decade-plus, Lacy said, he was determined to see something positive come out of his daughter's murder. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He stopped acting, and with a shoestring budget -- including much of his own money -- he started the LoveLife Foundation, an Oakland-based community organization that worked to promote non-violence through the arts and other educational programs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He organized neighborhood anti-violence marches every year on LoEshé's birthday, setting out from the spot where she was killed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His work even took him to the White House, where, along with families of other victims of violence, he met with then-first lady Hillary Clinton. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But it left him little time to grieve.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I refused to go to counseling. ... Everybody in the family was devastated, and I was like, 'I'm not going to let this break me,'"" Lacy said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It would take years, and one very public breakdown, before Lacy went to his first counseling session. That's when he started to think about Christopher Smith.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Once I realized what I was holding in,"" Lacy said, ""I realized part of the thing that was blocking me was that I hadn't forgiven him.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While Lacy was on the outside grappling with trauma, Smith was beginning to examine his own demons. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because he was sentenced as a teen, he spent his first two years in juvenile hall before he was sent to two of California's most notorious state prisons, Pelican Bay and Folsom. By 2011, Smith was in San Quentin.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Smith says that it was through group meetings in prison that he was finally able to do the work of facing the trauma of his childhood, holding himself accountable and forgiving himself.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Embarrassingly, it was maybe until my early 30s when I really started looking into my actions and how my actions caused so much harm,"" he said. ""But once I had that realization and breakthrough, I felt like now I could go from being an offender to being a servant.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He became active in a victim-offender education group, and received word that someone was interested in speaking with him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was Donald Lacy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lacy had begun working toward a meeting with Smith with the <a href=""http://www.insightprisonproject.org/"" target=""_blank"">Insight Prison Project</a> -- a group that specializes in restorative justice dialogues, which are conversations that bring victims and offenders together.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Restorative justice can be applied in a variety of cases and settings, but at its core it is a process that allows both victims and offenders to have a voice, and offers both parties an opportunity to seek healing, rehabilitation and accountability. It also offers victims a chance to get answers that they may not have gotten in court.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're looking at impact,"" said Jonathan Scharrer, director of the <a href=""https://law.wisc.edu/fjr/rjp/"" target=""_blank"">Restorative Justice Project at the University of Wisconsin</a> and an experienced restorative justice facilitator. ""It's a different focus than the traditional retributive justice lens, where the focus is just on the defendant or the person responsible for the crime."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While some have portrayed restorative justice as a ""soft"" approach to violence, some advocates say they aren't calling for an end to incarceration -- just for solutions beyond locking people away. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Studies have shown that restorative justice programs can, in fact, have an impact. An analysis of several surveys on restorative justice programs around the world found that in most cases, <a href=""https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/grants/250872.pdf"" target=""_blank"">participation in restorative justice programs reduced recidivism rates among offenders, and warrants more study</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And when given a choice, many survivors also prefer alternative responses to crime. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A national poll of crime survivors conducted by the Alliance for Safety and Justice <a href=""https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/commonjustice/pages/82/attachments/original/1506608259/accounting-for-violence.pdf?1506608259"" target=""_blank"">found that 69% of those impacted by crimes preferred to hold people accountable for their actions in ways other than prison time</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It's important, Scharrer says, not to confuse healing with forgiveness. Not every survivor wants to forgive, and it's certainly not a prerequisite to participate in a restorative justice dialogue. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It can be a by-product, but it's not the focus and is not even necessarily the goal,"" he said. ""It happens when it happens, but there's so much value beyond that singular thing.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Lacy's case, the process of preparing to sit down with Smith to discuss LoEshé's murder took years. He sometimes wavered on his decision to participate. Both parties had to agree to the terms and conditions around the meeting, and in the middle of the negotiations, the Insight Prison Project was approached by production company <a href=""http://www.citizenjones.com/"" target=""_blank"">Citizen Jones</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The men were asked to participate in a new CNN series called <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/shows/redemption-project-van-jones"" target=""_blank"">""The Redemption Project,""</a> and both agreed to allow cameras in the room for their meeting.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">April 24, 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After months of preparation, the day of their dialogue had arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The pair had last seen each other two decades earlier in court, but Lacy said Smith avoided eye contact with him then. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On this day, that wouldn't be an option. They would be sitting feet apart in a room at San Quentin prison, where Smith was incarcerated.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I didn't know what to expect. That fear of the unknown, the uncertainty,"" Smith said. ""We had prepped for the dialogue for a whole year straight, but nothing can prepare me or anyone else for a situation like that. I was nothing but raw emotions.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Following the mediator's lead, they each shared what they hoped to accomplish through the conversation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As they both choked back tears, Lacy said three words that transformed both of their lives: ""I forgive you."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Smith was in shock. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It was almost like I didn't hear it. It's like he had to say it a couple of times for it to really register,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walking out of that room in San Quentin, Lacy felt ""100,000 pounds lighter.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it was anywhere near easy for me to do that,"" Lacy said. ""But I always felt like ... there's this ancient African proverb and I forget exactly how it goes, but it's that children choose their parents before they come into the world. I always felt like my daughter chose me for this reason."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Six months after their meeting, Smith was paroled. Lacy had told the California courts that he was in favor of Smith's release.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now living back near Oakland, Smith has passed his driver's test and received his social security card, which he never had before he went to prison. He's also taking classes at Merritt College and working toward a degree in psychology. His goal is to become a marriage and family therapist, with a focus on single parent mothers and their children. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I just want to put myself in a position where I can try to teach and help people to heal, whatever that may look like,"" Smith said. ""And in return, I'm healing in the process.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Donald Lacy's healing process is ongoing, too. He says he's rooting for Smith, and wants to see him succeed in this second chance he was granted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And for now, he wants to get back to his life, the one that was upended on that October night more than 20 years ago. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The lesson I learned from my daughter is that we love people,"" Lacy said. ""This life and this world can be so much better if we just all put a little more effort into being compassionate. That was my daughter's greatest gift."" </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

It is a mastery unmatched by any tennis player on any surface in any era. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Winning a grand slam isn't easy. Winning 12 French titles is beyond belief,"" said on Twitter the man who presented Nadal with the Coupe des Mousquetaires, Rod Laver. Laver achieved the calendar year grand slam twice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal improved to 93-2 at the French Open and has never lost a final. Or even been taken to five sets. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem and other players must have been buoyed when Nadal -- coming off another knee injury -- began the clay-court swing poorly by his standards. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He admitted to doing some serious soul searching at the Barcelona Open in April after being, atypically, negative on court in an opening round win. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""After the first round in Barcelona, I was able to stay alone for a couple of hours in a room and think about it and think about what's going on, what I need to do,"" he said. ""And (there were) a couple of issues that I had to decide, no? One possibility was to stop for a while and recover my body. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""And the other was to change drastically my attitude and my mentality to play the next couple of weeks.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He picked the latter and beat Novak Djokovic in the Rome final last month for a considerable boost. Roland Garros was the grander exclamation mark. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Within two of Federer</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the first time, Nadal pulled to within two grand slams of Roger Federer, the man he eased past in their headline semifinal Friday. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the 37-year-old Swiss doesn't win another major, Nadal could get to 20 just by wracking up more victories at Roland Garros. As he has said before, though, he doesn't obsess about equaling Federer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I am not very worried about this stuff, no?"" Nadal said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You can't be frustrated all the time because the neighbor has a bigger house than you or a bigger TV or better garden. That's not the way that I see life.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the third straight season, the unfortunate Thiem lost to Nadal at the French Open after defeating him in a warmup.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He thus knows first hand the difference between trying to overcome Nadal over three sets compared to five. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That Thiem was able to make matters competitive is a credit to him -- three of the four sets were close, regardless of the final two set scores. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem ended the tournament playing four straight days thanks to the rain in what was a huge disadvantage for the bottom half of the draw. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Who knows what would have happened if he had the usual day off between the semifinal and final.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem's coach, Nicolas Massu, asked organizers to push the final to Monday to level the playing field but was told there was ""no chance."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Indeed Saturday was about the perfect day for Nadal. Thiem battled for an intense three hours against world No. 1 Djokovic in the completion of their weather affected semifinal -- and won. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unquestionably he would have preferred Thiem to Djokovic, one of those two players to have derailed Nadal at the French Open and the left-hander's toughest all-time opponent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Great effort from Thiem</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And especially a weakened Thiem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem, very well liked among his peers, is never one for excuses but admitted to feeling the effects of Saturday's thriller. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It was a grand slam final, so I didn't feel tired in the match,"" he said. ""But at the same time, a match like yesterday, beating Novak over two days with all the interruptions, it leaves traces on the body and also on the mind. That's 100%.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem -- who stretched Nadal to a five-set epic last year at the US Open -- said Saturday adrenaline would aid in his efforts to put up a fight against the spin master. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It wasn't simply fighting talk. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He possesses a brilliant combination of pace and power and more than once in the early going in intermittent sun, Thiem commendably chased balls and offered up defensive lobs to neutralize the Mallorcan. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His first set performance gave no hint of the struggle with Djokovic. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem trailed by an early break in the 2018 final but on this occasion, the 25-year-old broke first for 3-2 courtesy of his powerhouse forehand. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What wasn't in the script was to get broken in the next game. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was a momentum changing two games but an even more important one was to come.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an extended 10-minute game, Nadal saved a break point to hold for 4-3. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reeling, Thiem dropped serve, the game highlighted by Nadal chasing a fine Thiem drop shot and then replying with his own drop shot winner. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>First set key</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal was 84-0 at the French Open when winning the first set so it spelled big trouble for Thiem.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fans on Philippe Chatrier took turns chanting ""Rafa, Rafa"" and ""Dominic, Dominic,"" and were rewarded with another sparkling set. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Not phased by losing a 55-minute first set, Thiem's level didn't diminish. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Both men held comfortably without a break point in sight until Thiem conjured two in the 12th game. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And when Nadal sent his backhand long, he claimed his first set in their four Roland Garros duels. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Could he keep it going? Further, would Nadal respond? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The answer came quickly. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After a lengthy bathroom break, Nadal stormed to the first 11 points and tallied a double break advantage with a reflex forehand pass. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The spectators loved it and so did Nadal, who produced a multiple fist pump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""After the first two sets, I dropped a little bit my level"" and then Nadal ""stepped on me,"" conceded Thiem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal was now rolling, orchestrating a stunning backhand drop volley that earned a thumbs up from the Austrian. He won 23 of 27 net points, often approaching behind potent groundstrokes.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Almost everybody will tell you that he's one of the best volleyers of our game,"" Thiem said, before jokingly adding ""because the last time he missed a volley was maybe seven years ago."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He wrapped up the third with a sizzling 10 winners and two unforced errors. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One felt the exertions of the last few days were finally catching up to Thiem by this point but the fourth set wasn't a formality. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal saved a break point in the first game with a trademark forehand winner, broke and saved two more break points to lead 3-0. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A thinker</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For many Nadal's power and resilience are what catches the eye. But he is a thinker, too. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the first break point at 30-40, he struck a good serve to Thiem's backhand and the return went into the net. On the second, he changed direction and went down the middle with pace to prompt a forehand miscue. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal sealed the final on the stroke of three hours when another Thiem return sailed long. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He sunk to the clay, on his back, before exchanging a hug with Thiem. The two share a healthy respect. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a city filled with one boulangerie after another, Nadal tries for a baker's dozen of French Open titles in 2020. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Classic. Now imagine McCarthy as Trump chugging a bottle of ranch in the Oval Office while hosting the Golden State Warriors for a visit. Can you say Emmy bait, anyone?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>Dana Carvey</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carvey is an ""SNL"" legend.

Why would we deny ourselves that treat? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>James Corden</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sure, hosting the ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" on CBS puts the eponymous star at a slight disadvantage to star on NBC's ""SNL.""  But come on, Corden is in <em>everything</em> right now. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If Kate McKinnon can play multiple European leaders, then surely a Brit can take aim at Trump.

Fourteen months later, the Palmers say they still don't know what really happened. But they are suspicious because when Palmer's body was returned to them, his throat, heart and brain were missing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This entire case smacks of a cover-up,"" civil rights attorney Lee Merritt told CNN by phone.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/12/us/beneath-the-skin/"" target=""_blank"">Beneath the Skin: Horrific cuts cover her son's body after he's shot dead by police</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family hired Merritt to help find answers because so far, they have been unable to get them on their own, they say. Merritt says prison and county officials have not been cooperative with providing an official manner of death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But York County Coroner Pam Gay said those organs were actually retained as part of the forensic autopsy for additional testing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There were never any missing organs,"" Gay told CNN on Saturday. ""The lab that does our autopsies has the organs. Coroner's offices don't always have a morgue or a forensic pathologist. We contract those services out. We utilize a team in Allentown. That's who retains the specimens. They don't always tell us what they retain. We made that clear to the family from the beginning.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She noted that removing the throat is typical in this kind of investigation because ""we have to make sure there wasn't any kind of component that caused asphyxia.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gay also said local authorities have been cooperative.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We were in communications with them directly and through their attorney,"" she said. ""I understand their need and desire for answers. We are working to do that. The truth will come out. I can't comment on the active investigation.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Representatives for the prison could not be reached for comment Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An initial autopsy by the York County Coroner's Office stated Palmer died after an incident ""following an excited state"" during which he ""began hitting his head against the inside of his cell door"" and was restrained. The report says Palmer became agitated as a result of ""methamphetamine toxicity."" A probable ""sickling red cell disorder"" as listed as a contributing factor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to his family, Palmer never had any health problems leading up to his death. They also say the autopsy report of him hitting himself is completely out of character.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The York County Coroner's Office updated its autopsy results on July 28, 2018, to include a manner of death, which it listed as ""undetermined."" The autopsy report says details of the autopsy may be corrected as more information becomes available.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gay said investigations into possible drug-related deaths can take one to three years. She ruled out one cause of death, saying it wasn't suicide.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says Palmer did have ""some history of drug use,"" but never meth. Prison processing reports made available to the family provided no indication that Palmer was under the influence or had any drug paraphernalia listed in his items when he arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He would have had to receive (the meth) in the jail itself. We don't believe that happened,"" Merritt said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer's body was returned to his family, but it was only after the family hired their own independent forensic pathologist that they discovered Palmer's body was missing three body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's not unusual to take organs out of a body during an autopsy, especially if you believe they were subject to trauma. The highly unusual part is to misplace them,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For seven months, the family could not track down Palmer's brain, heart or throat. They say they were told by the York County Coroner to check with the funeral home for the body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The funeral home says they hadn't touched the body,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says they were later told by the coroner that the body parts were at an independent lab. However, the lab, Merritt says, has refused to hand over the parts, citing an ongoing investigation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt says the family believes the body parts will reveal details of how Palmer died. ""But we haven't been able to get them back yet,"" Merritt said. ""His constitutional rights are being violated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">CNN reached out to the York County District Attorney's Office for comment. Kyle King, the chief administrator and spokesman for the district attorney, told CNN by phone, ""The office of the district attorney does not comment on pending or ongoing investigations.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When asked how long an investigation into a case like this typically takes, King said, ""Every investigation is unique.""

An avid sports fan, especially of basketball, Palmer was often found working out in the gym or helping others achieve their goals as a personal trainer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer also enjoyed being a DJ and had a very ""eclectic taste in music,"" preferring heavy metal, according to his brother, Dwayne. He may have looked imposing, his brother says, but he loved to smile.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He joked around a lot. He was the life of the family,"" Dwayne Palmer said. ""He wasn't a perfect person, but certainly not somebody that's a rabble-rouser, fighting, starting trouble or anything like that.

He says the information they have been given so far is scant. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We don't believe anything (officials) are telling us at this point,"" he said. ""It's a tremendous loss for our family. We are devastated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the autopsy report, on the morning of his death, Everett Palmer Jr. was taken to a medical clinic where he was noted to be unresponsive. He was transferred to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If he was being processed for something that he did wrong in terms of the DUI -- he should be held accountable for that -- but it shouldn't be a death sentence, certainly inside of a jail,"" his brother added. ""We know that there are good people in that prison system. We appeal to them to come forward and share what they know.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Palmer family has put in a Freedom of Information Act request for any video recordings from the York County Prison while Palmer was in their custody.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been over a year and we want some answers. He was delivered back to us without organs. We want closure,"" Palmer said. ""If something criminal happened, and I believe something criminal did happen, we want the people that was involved in that to be held accountable.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The major problem in this case is what happened to Everett Palmer Jr. in a holding cell in police custody,"" Merritt said Saturday on CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Was a chokehold applied to Palmer? he asked. Why haven't other reports or video shot in the cell been released to the family? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We expect for York County and for the district attorney ... to do a thorough, complete investigation, which includes the autopsy, but it also includes gathering any reports about physical contact that was required in that cell, and releasing the videos to the family,"" Merritt said.

Whether it is performed by laser or the old-fashioned way, it's a surgery during which nearly all of the cat's first-toe bones, along with the tendons and ligaments, are removed. This brutal, permanent disfigurement leaves many cats with <a href=""https://www.drmartybecker.com/veterinary-medicine/the-tragedy-of-post-declaw-pain-syndrome-and-how-to-help-cats-who-suffer-from-it/"" target=""_blank"">chronic, lifelong pain</a>, much like amputees who experience phantom pain associated with their lost limbs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike human amputation, which is most often performed to save a life, cats are declawed to save a couch or the curtains.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cats scratch things. Like purring and meowing, scratching is an instinct, something cats are born to do. Denying cats the ability to satisfy one of their most basic behaviors is cruel. It also causes many cats to experience a variety of <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523124130.htm"" target=""_blank"">negative side effects</a>, including aggression and depression. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many declawed cats resort to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098612X17705044"" target=""_blank"">biting and litter box avoidance or both</a>.

If people can't tolerate a little bit of cat scratching, they certainly won't tolerate aggression, biting, depression and litter box avoidance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though the law in most states, including New York, still <a href=""https://aldf.org/issue/animals-legal-status/"" target=""_blank"">considers animals property</a>, we know better.

The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said.

Fewer (about 6 in 10) say it's a must have to support restoring the ban on assault-style weapons. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among in-person caucusgoers, liberals are more apt to call nearly all of the nine issues tested ""must-haves"" than are moderates, but the gap is largest on <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/19/politics/medicare-for-all-explainer/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Medicare for All</a> (60% of liberals call it a must-have vs. 39% of moderates) and abortion rights (90% vs. 70%). There is also a wide gap by age on Medicare for All, with those under age 35 about 20 points more likely to prioritize it than their elders.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Younger caucusgoers were also more likely to see student debt forgiveness as a must-have (61% among those under age 35 vs. roughly a third of older likely caucus attendees), and while there aren't sharp differences by age on the importance of recognizing climate change as humanity's greatest threat, there is a wide gap on support for the Green New Deal (42% among those under age 35 consider it a must-have vs. less than 30% among older likely caucus attendees). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although support for abortion rights tops the list, it also prompts a gender divide in the poll. It is more of a ""must-have"" issue for women (85%) than for men (72%). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The survey also looked at whether certain traits which divide the historically large field would be advantages or disadvantages for a general election run against President Donald Trump. Just one was named an advantage by majorities of both in-person and virtual likely caucus participants: Having years of experience in Washington.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Three of the top four candidates in the race are age 69 or older, yet almost no likely caucus participants say that many years of experience on Earth is an advantage (1% among likely in-person attendees call being over age 70 an advantage against Trump, 3% among virtual). Those who back former Vice President Joe Biden (age 76) are more apt to say it doesn't make a difference than are other likely caucusgoers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likely caucus participants are divided on whether being a woman helps or hurts against Trump. Among those likely to participate in-person, 23% call it an advantage, 19% a disadvantage and 54% say it makes no difference. But among those likely to participate virtually, a larger 28% see being a woman as a disadvantage and 23% call it an advantage.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likely caucus participants tilt positive on the effects of coming from a place that mostly votes for Democrats and on being white.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Three-in-five likely in-person Democratic Iowan caucusgoers say that being gay makes no difference in a candidate's ability to face Trump in the general election, while a quarter see it as a disadvantage.

Well, I say let's call Barack Obama, because that's identity fraud,"" California Sen. Kamala Harris said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Former Colorado Gov.

""In my view, that approach is not just bad public policy, but it is a failed political strategy that I feel could end up with the reelection of Donald Trump.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Sanders has his critics -- and they used their platforms to pushback against his agenda and question his electability.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, a critic of Medicare for All, ticked off a list of European countries -- ""whose systems we admire"" -- that guarantee universal health care using models that keep a role for private insurers, which Medicare for All, in almost every case, does not. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hickenlooper argued that Sanders would be an easy mark for Republicans.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We must present a bold vision for the future,"" Hickenlooper said, ""but we also must acknowledge that the most effective attack the Republicans can level against us is 'socialism.'""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The day-long affair -- which included some campaign staffers waking up at 4 a.m., to position themselves and boisterous supporters lining the streets with thousands of signs and eye-grabbing spectacles -- represents the informal kickoff of the Iowa caucus season, with each campaign hoping to use the speech as a springboard to a summer full of organizing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But for many, the event was just about getting some attention -- from the media and activists.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The challenge is that people just don't know my name,"" said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. ""That's the principal challenge.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And the historic size of the Democratic field impacted the event in a number of unique ways.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was difficult to move a few feet in the Cedar Rapids' venue without bumping into a candidate for president, a situation that created some unique interactions between competitors and their supporters. Sanders walked into the venue before the event as Harris supporters chanted about electing a woman to the White House, Hickenlooper and the California senator shared cheddar popcorn before both went on stage, and a bagpiper -- paid for by Delaney -- blared in the middle of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar's speech rallying her supporters outside the venue.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Each candidate was given five minutes of time on stage, with those who ran long being played off by loud Oscars-style music. The short time also forced speakers to make impressions off the stage, so the candidates mingled, chanted and rallied with their most ardent supporters outside the venue. Candidates and their spouses ran into each other. Activists chanted, cheered and marched through the streets. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The spectacle outside</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sanders led a ""Fight for 15"" solidarity march with striking McDonald's workers demanding a $15-an-hour minimum wage and a union, filling the street in front of the venue after headlining a rally nearby a few minutes earlier.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke's campaign brought in a Moys breakfast taco truck and handed out flyers that offered a free taco to other campaigns' volunteers ""in appreciation of your support for the many Democrats running 4 POTUS."" Later, his campaign bought a long table full of Casey's Pizza for those leaving the event.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Delaney's team included at least a pair of sign-spinners and a helium-filled mini-blimp displaying the former Maryland congressman's name.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker made perhaps the largest organizing push, with chants and cheers echoing through the venue as his supporters followed him in.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Buttigieg's campaign hosted a sprawling picnic that included bag toss, food truck and live music, with the mayor himself playing the keyboard before marching over to the event flanked by his supporters.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Outside groups were also on hand. Volunteers with the Sunrise Movement and other environmental organizations pushed candidates to address climate change. A Greenpeace scoreboard rating 2020 Democrats was on display across the street from the dinner. Supporters of The Young Turks chanted ""sign the pledge,"" urging Democrats to promise their support for a progressive economic platform the left-leaning news outlet recently unveiled.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iowa Democrats celebrated two freshman congresswomen, Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, who both won office in a midterm election in which female candidates and voters fueled the Democratic surge to a House majority.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand seized on that fact, making a direct appeal to the women in the room ""and the men who love them"" by urging Democrats to see the fact that women led Democrats back to control of the House in 2018 that a woman can win in 2020.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Women are on fire in America today. We have marched, we have organized, we have run for office and we have won. Because of women we flipped the US House of Representative,"" she said, imploring the crowd to believe ""now is not the time to be polite, now is not the time for small steps, now is the time to fight like hell.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Struggling for attention</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gillibrand has struggled to get traction in a field where only five candidates are polling above 5% in Iowa. Female candidates who are well-known in Washington, like Gillibrand and Klobuchar, are fighting for oxygen in a field with two older white men in Biden and Sanders leading.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Every so often I get sad about the numbers for some of the women -- including everyone, our combined numbers and what they are -- but I think it has been improving and I think people are taking us seriously and I think the debates are going to be a really good chance for the woman to show their stuff,"" Klobuchar said Saturday while campaigning in Cresco.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Could we be running with less experience than we had?"" she asked about the men in the race. ""I don't think so. I don't think people would take us seriously.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At such a crammed and fast-paced event, lesser-known candidates fought just to put themselves on Iowa Democrats' radars.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Montana Gov. Steve Bullock accused Trump of turning elections into ""dark money auctions"" and touted his legal fights against the Koch brothers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Colorado Sen.

Ireland is a beautiful place and I enjoyed the opportunity to experience these unique Irish traditions. Thank you to Shannon Heritage for hosting this lovely event,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In lieu of the speeches and the public remarks -- and perhaps because she has become known as one of the most fashionable women in the world -- for Melania Trump, the visuals are even more acute. This may be especially so because she is less publicly verbose than most of her immediate predecessors -- for the curious public, sometimes there's just a visual to chew over.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reading the tea leaves of her brand of fashion diplomacy was a buzzy pastime this week, both in the headlines of British tabloids and in the background of chats between royal- and Trump-watchers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She doesn't pay attention to headlines,"" her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told CNN of the scrutiny.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady herself said last fall during a solo trip to Africa when she was criticized for wearing a pith helmet: ""I wish people would focus on what I do, and not what I wear."" A wish, perhaps unfortunately for her, not likely to come true anytime soon, at least while on the global stage.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Regardless, questions remain.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Was the Gucci print dress emblazoned with drawings of iconic London landmarks like Buckingham Palace and the London Bridge too obvious a sartorial symbol? Did the red, cape-sleeve Givenchy gown at Winfield House in London serve as a silent symbol of support to Meghan Markle? (The President referred the duchess as ""nasty,"" but Givenchy was also the designer of Markle's wedding gown?) And how about the big black sunglasses she kept on for most of the day in Normandy, France, while honoring the 75th anniversary of D-Day -- should she have shown her eyes instead? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They're the sorts of questions that, remarkably, hover about a first lady, particularly Melania Trump, whose stealthy maneuvers and mysterious demeanor have earned her the nickname ""the Slovenian Sphinx"" by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Sartorial choices</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is the ongoing discussion over a first lady's choices -- should she pay homage to the host country by wearing designs by a homegrown designer? Michelle Obama was a big proponent of going that route, and would frequently travel globally with outfits specifically culled based on the label's association with the spots she would visit. Other first ladies, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush among them, would go the route of wearing iconic American designers on foreign soil, to represent the United States abroad.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump does neither the former, nor the latter, with consistency. Yet, as with most things one might expect from the first lady, she -- like her husband -- hardly abides by a standard playbook. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So while many fashion critics may have drawn in their breath at the sight of Trump getting off Marine One at Buckingham Palace on Monday wearing a fitted white dress with navy accents and a chic matching hat -- tilted just-so on top of her head -- they were not surprised to learn the designer of the ensemble was neither British nor American. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For her most iconic moment, an audience with the Queen of England and her family, Trump had chosen to wear a custom-designed Dolce &amp; Gabbana, an Italian fashion house with a longstanding relationship with the first lady. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Dolce &amp; Gabbana have also been in the headlines several times in recent months for their controversial comments surrounding race and sexuality; in November they canceled a runway show in China after cries of racial insensitivity following a marketing campaign that featured a video of a Chinese model attempting to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Yet the brand has been exceedingly loyal to Trump, who has worn them repeatedly since her husband took office, including for her official portrait, in which she sports a Dolce &amp; Gabbana black suit. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump, like the President, is prone to doing business with those who have her back and Stefano Gabbana has gone so far as to champion on his social media accounts how honored he is for her to wear the label. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's as many in the fashion world have been vocally opposed to dressing Trump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hat, which was a custom addition, was made by Trump's personal style adviser, Hervé Pierre, a frequent collaborator of the first lady. Pierre was born in France but is now a United States citizen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And while the dress and hat were not made by a British designer, it was quickly apparent the look resembled the silhouette and style of some of the dresses worn by the late Princess Diana. Or, the character Eliza Doolittle, played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 film version of ""My Fair Lady,"" also decidedly British.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>An evening with royalty</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the evening State Banquet at Buckingham Palace, Trump stuck with white, and she also kept to a non-UK designer, this time a sleeveless Dior Haute Couture gown with detail on the bodice. It was perhaps less imaginative than one might have hoped for the pomp and circumstance of the occasion, but Trump also ensured she wouldn't steal the spotlight from the Queen. The dress was elegant, but simple. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, also wore white that evening, as did Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, who chose a tiered gown by British design house Alexander McQueen. The Queen wore white, too, and accessorized with the Burmese Ruby and Diamond Tiara, which she had made in 1973. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Photos of the day and evening of interactions between Trump and the Queen and Camilla showcased smiles and growing familiarity, a burgeoning friendship between the US first lady and two of Great Britain's centerpiece royals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She enjoyed chatting with both the Queen and Duchess of Cornwall,"" said Grisham to CNN. ""They are very warm and strong women.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President wore white tails to the white tie event, but his tuxedo, from head to toe, was lambasted for being remarkably ill-fitted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The banquet was another chance for the first lady to showcase a British or American designer, something Ivanka Trump did that evening, wearing a voluminous baby blue shirt-dress gown with embellishments by designer Carolina Herrera. It retails for $11,000. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike her stepmother, the Herrera would be the only outfit Ivanka wore in public during the London leg of the trip that was not British-made. Earlier that day she sported a feminine, flouncy-skirt Alessandra Rich suit with a white Philip Treacy hat; on Tuesday, for meetings and a tour at 10 Downing Street, Ivanka wore a polka-dot Burberry ensemble, and that evening, for the dinner at Winfield House, she was in a white gown by London-based designer Safiyaa.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Hostess abroad</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later in the trip, Melania Trump served as hostess for the reciprocal dinner at Winfield House, something she had been planning in Washington for weeks. Her duties included picking everything from the china to the color palette, menu, guest list and seating chart. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the event, the first lady chose a favored silhouette: the cape-sleeve dress. If you've paid attention to Trump's style at all over the past three to four years, it's clear she does love to have coats, jackets and, yes, dresses draped in cape-style over her shoulders. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, she's worn cape-style dresses for many formal occasions prior to Tuesday, once in Japan in 2017 to a state dinner there, and a short, black tuxedo version by Givenchy during a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the White House in 2018. The Tuesday night Winfield House dinner dress was also by Givenchy, though it was long and bright red and flowy, with sequins on the bodice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The selection of Givenchy was as mysterious as most things Melania -- an iconic French brand, but now designed by British stylist Clare Waight Keller. Was the first lady wearing French, or British, or a dash of both? What was notable was the dress was not specially made for the occasion, nor was it customized in any way. In fact, you or I could go online and buy it in a few clicks ourselves, if we had a spare $8,340.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Honoring veterans</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Wednesday, it was another Trump repeat, to attend a ceremony in Portsmouth, England, honoring the 75th D-Day anniversary. Trump emerged from Marine One to take her seat with the President wearing a cream-colored coat by The Row (the label helmed by former child actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Unlike earlier iterations, this hat was decidedly British, by famed milliner Philip Treacy, whose designs are favored by members of the Royal Family, especially Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Trump's was more flying saucer-shaped than the vertical creations that Treacy hats often take, but it was no less fashionable on Trump, whose hair was swept up into a bun.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And just when one might start to think the white was a running sartorial theme, the first lady stepped out the following day for commemorative ceremonies in Normandy, France, in head-to-toe black. It marked what is by this reporter's count, at least her 8th public outing in a black coat as first lady. This one was by Dior, again, French and, again, unclear if the nod was purposeful to being on France's shores for the day, or whether it was simply what she wanted to wear, when she wanted to wear it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Trump departed Ireland on Friday, en route back home to Washington, she was wearing her oft-seen Burberry trench coat, belted tightly at the waist, with a light-blue silk headscarf looped over her head, tucked beneath her chin. While the scarf was an accessory she has never worn in public before that day, it is a look frequently favored by someone the first lady had just spent a good deal of time with on her trip ... Queen Elizabeth.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

I just can't."" </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Baldwin gave two reasons for leaving the show. One was spending more time with his family. But the other reason makes me wonder if Trump helped drive Baldwin from the role. Baldwin shared that ""all these people were attacking me,"" saying things like, ""Your impression sucks and you suck. Please go away."" The actor apparently had enough, explaining, ""I thought to myself: 'I really don't have a lot invested in my Trump impersonation, so please find someone and convince Lorne [Michaels] to replace me.' ""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This isn't a total surprise. Baldwin's reactions to Trump's attacks on Twitter over the years offer insight into whether Trump played a role in Baldwin's decision.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At first, Baldwin ignored Trump or responded playfully. For example, in December 2016, just a month before being sworn in, Trump <a href=""https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-saturday-night-live-tax-returns-1201933252/"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, ""Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad."" In response, Baldwin<a href=""https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-saturday-night-live-tax-returns-1201933252/"" target=""_blank""> tweeted</a>, ""Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In March 2018, Trump took his attacks to an<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/trump-alec-baldwin-snl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> even more personal level</a>, writing, ""Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch."" Then adding, ""Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!"" Despite the anger of Trump's tweet, Baldwin again<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/trump-alec-baldwin-snl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> responded with humor</a>, tweeting, ""Agony though it may be, I'd like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But, recently, Baldwin's responses turned much more serious, expressing concern that Trump was trying to inspire someone to attack him or his family. In February 2019, Trump took to Twitter<a href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097116612279316480"" target=""_blank""> calling for ""retribution""</a> against ""SNL"" for mocking him: ""Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution?""  Trump then <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553"" target=""_blank"">added a tweet</a> minutes later, ""THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a reminder, this was just four months after self-professed Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc -- known as the ""MAGA bomber"" -- had <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/us/cesar-sayoc-guilty-plea/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sent explosive devices</a> to a variety of critics of Trump, from Hillary Clinton to CNN. Perhaps that (and Trump's tweets) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/1097319232151449600"" target=""_blank"">explain Baldwin's response</a>: ""I wonder if a sitting President exhorting his followers that my role in a TV comedy qualifies me as an enemy of the people constitutes a threat to my safety and that of my family?"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, just because Baldwin won't play Trump anymore does not mean that ""SNL"" will stop mocking the President. But has Trump succeeded in diminishing the visibility of the show by possibly driving out an award-winning actor who will be replaced by someone less known -- given that ""SNL"" is typically a platform for up-and-coming talent?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another apparent victory for Trump in his war on comedy involves the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) annual dinner, which for years featured a comedian who roasted the President. That is, until this year's dinner in April, when instead they <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-is-the-white-house-correspondents-association-doing-trumps-bidding"" target=""_blank"">featured historian Ron Chernow</a>. To many, it appeared the WHCA had yielded to Trump's demands after he took to Twitter to not only lash out at comedian Michelle Wolf,  who had mocked his administration at last year's dinner, but also called for the WHCA to change the dinner's format of featuring a comic: ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/990782291667488768"" target=""_blank"">Put Dinner to rest, or start over!</a>"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To be clear, Trump's war on comedy predates his run for president. For example, in 2013, Trump<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675"" target=""_blank""> sued Bill Maher</a> for $5 million for making a joke that Trump is ""the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan."" (He later withdrew the lawsuit.) And over the years, Trump has<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/opinions/trump-losing-war-on-comedy-obeidallah/index.html"" target=""_blank""> angrily lashed out</a> against comedians Jon Stewart and Seth Meyers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But never before has Trump appeared to have won even one skirmish in this war on comedy -- until now. We can debate the role Trump played in Baldwin ending his ""SNL"" run or the WHCA no longer featuring a comedian. But clearly these are developments Trump wanted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hope is that Trump never wins another battle in this war. Comedy has long been used in America to expose the faults of people in power, especially presidents. We cannot allow comedy to be silenced or infringed upon in any way simply because Trump is too thin skinned to take a joke.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Last year alone, the country received <a href=""https://www.nknews.org/2019/01/number-of-north-korean-defections-to-south-rose-in-2018-mou/"" target=""_blank"">1,137</a> defectors -- and 85% of them were women.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It is much easier for them to flee, because they are not usually enrolled in formal employment at a factory or a state firm where any absence would be immediately reported,"" said Yeo Sang Yoon, from the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights, an NGO in Seoul. ""They are in charge of the household and can thus slip away unnoticed.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee grew up in a family of low-level party cadres in North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We had enough food,"" she said. ""We even had rice and wheat stored in the garage."" But Lee felt her parents were too strict. ""I had to be home before sundown, and they didn't allow me to study medicine.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One day, after getting into a fight with them, she decided to cross the border into China. Lee said she found a broker to facilitate the dangerous move who promised her a job in a restaurant.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That promise turned out to be a lie. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Usually, women like Lee pay brokers $500 to $1,000 to organize their safe passage to China, according to NGOs and defector accounts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To reach China, many defectors cross the Tumen River that separates North Korea from China on foot at night, sometimes in freezing weather with the water coming up to their shoulders.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011, border security was tightened to avoid the bad publicity associated with defections and prevent information about North Korea trickling into the country, according to Tim Peters, an American pastor who co-founded an NGO called Helping Hands that helps defectors flee. An electric fence was added, as well as cameras at the border.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""On the Chinese side, patrols were also increased because Beijing is afraid an influx of refugees could destabilize its own regime,"" he added.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>North Korea is visible from Yanji in China. </em> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two huge portraits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il hang at the entrance of a bridge linking the two countries.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once on Chinese soil, defectors must reach the city of Tumen that sits right up against the icy river, in a lunar landscape of barren hills. North Korea is visible from the town -- farmers in a village there can be seen plowing their fields with antique machinery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee crossed the Tumen River in a group of eight girls.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When she arrived in China, Lee said she was taken to a apartment on the fourth floor of a pale yellow building in Yanji, a city in Jilin province about 50 kilometers from Tumen, where most signs are written in Korean and Chinese and scores of restaurants sell bibimbap and kimchi, due to the large population of ethnic Koreans.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the apartment, she realized there was no restaurant job.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Instead, Lee said her broker had sold her for 30,000 yuan (about $4,500) to the operator of a cybersex chatroom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When I found out, I felt so humiliated,"" she whispered. ""I started crying and asked to leave, but the boss said he had paid a lot of money for me and I now had a debt towards him.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Korean NGOs estimate that 70% to 80% of North Korean women who make it to China are trafficked, for between 6,000 and 30,000 yuan ($890 to $4,500), depending on their age and beauty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some are sold as brides to Chinese farmers; more recently, girls have increasingly been trafficked into the cybersex industry, according to the KFI.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rising wages in northern China cities have led to a greater demand for prostitutes among the male population, according to the KFI report. In southern China, trafficked women from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia has typically met that demand. But in northeastern provinces, men have turned to North Korean refugees.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A spokesperson for the Chinese government said in a statement to CNN: ""I want to stress that the Chinese government pays high attention to foreign citizens' legitimate rights according to law, also combat activities of human trafficking women and child.""   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Michael Glendinning, director of the KFI, said the Chinese government was ""not doing enough to protect North Korean women and girls in its territory at all.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""China must work to crack down on the networks and individuals -- including Chinese public officials -- responsible for the trafficking of North Korean women and girls, he said. ""But it must do so in a way that ensures that these women and girls are not repatriated to North Korea where they would face torture, imprisonment, and possibly extrajudicial killing.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two other North Korean women already lived in the two-bedroom apartment Lee was delivered to. One was 27 years old, had her own bedroom and seemed close to the chatroom boss. ""I think she was supposed to spy on us,"" said Lee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The other girl was Kwang Ha-Yoon, whose name has been changed to protect her identity for her safety. Kwang was 19 years old and had been locked up for two years when Lee arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""My parents split up when I was very young and I grew up with my mother and grandparents,"" she said. ""We never had enough to eat."" Kwang left North Korea to earn money to send to her family. ""Both my mother and my grandmother had cancer and needed treatment,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But all the money Kwang earned in China went to her captor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee and Kwang had to share a room. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The only furniture was two beds, two tables and two computers,"" recalled Kwang. ""Every morning, I would get up around 11 a.m., have breakfast and then start working until dawn the next day."" Sometimes, she would only get four hours of sleep. If they complained, they would get beaten, although both women said they did not suffer sexual abuse by their captor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Work involved logging onto an online chat platform on which South Korean men can pay to watch girls perform sexual acts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes of logging on to the site, users are barraged by women on the platform sending text messages asking for a video chat in a private room.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They all claim to be from a major city in South Korea. The minimum price to chat on the site is 150 won (13 cents), but girls can set the entry price for a room, with popular accounts tending to have a more expensive entry fee. Tips start at a minimum of 300 won (25 cents), but can go far higher as customers try to persuade the girls to fulfill their requests. Lee and Kwang were tasked by their captors with keeping the men online for as long as possible. In South Korea, where prostitution is illegal, these services have become increasingly popular in recent years. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">CNN reached out to the platform to ask what steps it takes to protect women like Lee and Kwang on its site, but the company did not respond.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Some of the men just wanted to talk, but most wanted more,"" said Lee, with a shudder of disgust. ""They would ask me to take suggestive poses or to undress and touch myself. I had to do everything they asked."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I felt like dying 1,000 times, but I couldn't even kill myself as the boss was always watching us,"" she said.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her captor was a man of South Korean descent who slept in the living room to keep a close eye on the women.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The front door was always locked from the outside and there was no handle on the inside,"" said Kwang. ""Every six months, he would take us out to the park.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On this small patch of green next to their apartment, retirees would meet to dance to music each afternoon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""During those outings, he would always stay right next to us, so we never got to talk to anyone,"" said Lee. In 2015, Lee tried to escape by climbing out of a window and down a metal drain, but she fell and hurt her back and leg. She still limps slightly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When their captor wanted something from the girls, he would try to sweet talk them, promising a cut of their earnings or to let them go free to work in South Korea one day.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when Kwang asked for a piece of the 60 million won (around $51,000) she estimated she had made for him, he got angry.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He started kicking, slapping and cursing me,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During the seven years Kwang spent locked up in his apartment, she said he never gave her a cent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3> A ray of light</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was during the summer of 2018 that Lee finally saw her chance to escape.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""One of my customers realized I was North Korean and was being held captive,"" said Lee. While most men probably knew the girls weren't South Korean, because North Koreans have different accents and dialects to people in the south, they chose to look the other way.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This man was different.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He bought a laptop and let me take control of the screen remotely, so I could send messages without my boss noticing,"" Lee said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The man also gave her the phone number of a South Korean pastor named Chun Ki-Won.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Chun, a mild-mannered man with high cheekbones and wavy gray hair, is one of a band of Korean pastors who specialize in helping North Korean women escape from China. Chun said his Christian aid organization, Durihana, has helped over 1,000 defectors reach Seoul since 1999. Korean media has nicknamed him the Asian <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/seoultrain/activists.html"" target=""_blank"">Schindler</a>, after the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of 1,200 Jews.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In the past few years, dozens of missionaries linked to my organization have been deported from China,"" he said from his Seoul office that overflowed with plants, books and religious figurines. ""There are only a few left, and they have to stay on the move constantly to avoid being arrested.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">China is a close ally of Pyongyang and doesn't consider North Korean defectors refugees, instead seeing them as <a ""="""" href=""https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg74809/html/CHRG-112hhrg74809.htm "" target=""_blank"">illegal</a> economic migrants. ""When it catches them, it sends them back (to North Korea), where they face torture, internment in a labor camp and sometimes death,"" said Lee Eunkoo, the co-founder of Teach North Korean Refugees, an NGO that helps defectors learn English.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In September 2018, Lee contacted Pastor Chun on KakaoTalk, a Korean messaging service. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hi, I want to go to South Korea. Can you help me?"" read the first message she sent.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over the following weeks, Lee explained to Chun how she had ended up in a cybersex chatroom. He asked her about the apartment's layout and her boss' comings and goings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By mid-October a plan had been hatched: Chun would send a team to Yanji to extract Lee and Kwang.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On October 26, while Yumi's boss was away for the day, Durihana's members arrived at the foot of the building. The two girls knotted their bedsheets together and dropped them out of their window. The extraction team then tied a rope to the sheets, which the girls pulled up and used to lower themselves safely to the ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They were only able to take a small backpack with a couple of essentials -- a pack of wet wipes and a comb. They jumped into a car and sped away.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The whole operation took minutes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Journey to the south</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Korean pastors have set up a network of routes and safe houses in China inspired by the Underground Railroad, the secret passages enslaved African-Americans used to escape to free states from the late 1700s until the US Civil War.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Each individual cell knows nothing about the other ones, to avoid compromising the whole operation if one of them gets caught,"" said Tim Peters, the American pastor living in Seoul who is helping North Koreans flee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before 1998, defectors would simply knock on the door of the South Korean consulate general in Shenyang, the capital of neighboring Liaoning province, around 790 kilometers (490 miles) from the border with North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But during the Sunshine Policy era (1998 to 2008), which saw a rapprochement between Seoul and Pyongyang, several refugees were deported to North Korea from the Shenyang consulate, according to the book ""Escape from North Korea: The Untold Story of Asia's Underground Railroad"" by Melanie Kirkpatrick. Defectors then started crossing the Gobi desert into Mongolia, aiming to reach the South Korean embassy in the capital. But that route closed in 2010, when Ulaanbaatar reinstated strong diplomatic links with North Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The only option left was to go south through China, hoping to reach a country that wouldn't send North Korean refugees home.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After escaping Yanji, Lee and Kwang said they went across China on buses and trains using fake Korean passports. Their last stop was Kunming, in China's deep southwest. From there, most defectors cross the border illegally into Laos or Myanmar and either head for the South Korean Embassy in the capital cities of those countries, or continue to Bangkok, in Thailand. CNN has not revealed which country Lee and Kwang traveled to for security reasons.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lee and Kwang met with a Chinese man who took them across the mountains into a neighboring country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We walked for five hours through the jungle, before reaching a road where a car was waiting for us,"" said Kwang. Chun later met them in the middle of the night on the side of a road. ""I burst into tears as soon as I saw him,"" said Kwang, who is now 24 years old. ""For the first time in a very long time, I felt safe.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After two more days of traveling by car and bus, they reached the capital city. ""We were stopped several times by the police for routine checks, I was terrified,"" said Kwang.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In total, they said their journey from Kunming took 50 hours.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As they rode towards the embassy in a tuk tuk, Lee stared giddily at the urban landscape unfolding before her eyes. ""I'm so happy!"" she said, as the embassy approached. Kwang was more nervous. ""I know I should feel joy, but I just feel empty,"" she said. ""I don't know what to expect, and I am afraid of the interrogations at the embassy.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At 5.30 p.m., the two defectors and Chun walked up to the black and golden gate of Seoul's diplomatic representation. Before they had a chance to ring the bell, they said a man in a black shirt opened the door and ushered them inside with a smile.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A few minutes later, Chun walked out -- alone.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The embassy, which receives about 10 defectors a month, according to officials, kept the women for about 10 days for questioning. Those who satisfy the questioning process will fly to freedom in South Korea.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Upon arrival in South Korea, defectors spend three months at Hanawon, a processing center where they learn how to navigate staples of modern life such as taking the subway, getting cash from an ATM or buying groceries in a supermarket. They are then provided with a South Korean passport, a subsidized apartment and the right to enroll at a university for free.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before entering the South Korean Embassy, Lee had given her new life a lot of thought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to study English and Chinese and maybe become a teacher,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kwang, who had left school at 12, hoped to graduate.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I never really had the luxury of wondering what to do with my life,"" she said.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Jake Kwon also contributed to this report.</p>]"

Officers urged protesters to disperse. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The protest was mostly peaceful during the day, but it turned violent overnight, with police trying to clear protesters with batons.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands also gathered to protest the extradition bill in cities across Australia on Sunday.

CNN journalists on the ground said the bulk of the protesters had dispersed by then, leaving a number of people milling around the Legislative Council. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late Sunday, the government of Hong Kong released a statement acknowledging the ongoing protests across the island but reiterating the contested bill is still scheduled to resume debate June 12.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We urge the Legislative Council to scrutinize the Bill in a calm, reasonable and respectful manner to help ensure Hong Kong remains a safe city for residents and business,"" it said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Murder of tourist </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The case for the bill was expedited by a grisly murder case in Taiwan, where a 20-year-old Hong Kong woman was allegedly killed by her boyfriend while on holiday there. Currently, the suspect cannot be sent from Hong Kong to face justice in Taiwan.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, Taipei has already said it will refuse to cooperate with the new law if it puts Taiwanese citizens at risk of being extradited to China. The self-ruled island has previously seen citizens accused of crimes in countries that do not recognize Taiwan diplomatically being <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/09/asia/taiwan-kenya-deportations/index.html"" target=""_blank"">handed to Chinese custody</a>, despite objections of Taipei.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this week, Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, slammed the bill.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People have known exactly why there shouldn't be an extradition agreement with China for years,"" Patten said in a <a href=""https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/06/video-last-colonial-governor-hong-kong-chris-patten-says-govt-defence-extradition-bill-absolute-nonsense/"" target=""_blank"">video</a> message Thursday.

But this time they, too, have spoken out against the bill. In a bid to secure their support, the government has limited the scope of extraditable offenses -- but for some that is still not enough. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong <a href=""https://www.amcham.org.hk/news/press-release-proposed-fugitive-offenders-ordinance"" target=""_blank"">warned</a> last week there were ""too many uncertainties in fundamental sections of the proposed legislation"" for it to be passed in its current form. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hong Kong is not ready to see this bill passed and we do not see why it should be rushed through when the loophole it seeks to address has existed for 20 years,"" the chamber said in a statement. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But government spokesman Matthew Cheung said the move was time sensitive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The suspect in the Taiwan murder case is serving sentences for other criminal offenses in Hong Kong but is expected to be released this October,"" Cheung said. ""There is thus a pressing need to provide a legal basis for the assistance that we want to render to Taiwan, before the (legislature) goes into summer recess from mid-July to October."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cheung did not address Taipei's concerns over the bill.

""Continued erosion of the 'One country, Two systems' framework puts at risk Hong Kong's long-established special status in international affairs.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Fierce opposition </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The extradition bill, particularly an attempt to fast-track it through Hong Kong's semi-democratic Legislature, has reinvigorated the city's flagging opposition movement after numerous setbacks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Organizers claimed 130,000 people took part in a protest against the bill <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/29/asia/hk-protest-extradition-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">in April</a>. While police gave the lower figure of 22,800, it was still the biggest protest since the 2014 Umbrella Movement, an ultimately unsuccessful protest over political reform which shut down parts of the city for months. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fears over the bill -- and criticism from a broad swath of Hong Kong society -- echo 2003, when half a million people took to the streets to oppose the passage of an anti-sedition law. That legislation was shelved, but the issue has become such a hot-button topic in Hong Kong that -- despite promising to do so -- no governments since have attempted to introduce it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sunday's protest comes days after the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/asia/tiananmen-june-4-china-censorship-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre</a>, a pivotal moment that dashed hopes China would democratize before it took control of Hong Kong in 1997. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hong Kong has commemorated the massacre with a candlelit vigil ever since, the only place on Chinese soil where mass remembrances are held.

When he talks about his daughter -- his ""Carly,"" his ""Carlita"" -- his husky, deep voice breaks into sobs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">For nearly six months he has traveled to nearly a dozen small towns in a remote region of the Peruvian Andes called the Sacred Valley. He takes flyers with his daughter's face printed on them and walks from house to house, interviewing anyone who might have seen her. Living on his savings, money from his son and some <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/findcarla"" target=""_blank"">GoFundMe</a> donations, he's been staying in small hotel rooms and trying to spend as little as possible on food and toiletries.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla was on her way to an Inca archaeological site near Cusco on December 12 when she vanished and her family's lives turned upside down. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her father has traveled across mountains, walked through massive cornfields and searched remote caves looking for her. He's developed relationships with the local police, and even embedded with them to search suspected drug houses.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Along with his son, he has tracked down people who met Carla before she vanished, found the backpack that she left behind at a hostel, requested surveillance footage and tried to request cell phone tower data, only to learn that previous police requests were never completed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People need to understand that if they suffer a tragedy like my family has been suffering, they need to know to be prepared for the worst, that they need to take matters in their own hands,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the State Department has declined to share exact numbers on how many Americans have gone missing abroad in the past five years, stories of US citizens who vanish in a foreign country have recently made headlines. News outlets have covered the last known moments of a<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/11/us/missing-americans-dominican-republic-identification/index.html"" target=""_blank""> New York couple</a> that vanished and was later found dead in the Dominican Republic, detailed the final conversations that a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/06/us/carla-stefaniak-costa-rica-tourist-death/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Florida woman</a> who was murdered in Costa Rica had with her family, and published the travel photos of a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/18/world/north-carolina-teacher-killed-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">North Carolina teacher</a> who was murdered while backpacking in Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the quiet struggles of the families of travelers who go missing have gotten less attention. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Chasing her dream in Peru</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At 35 years old, Carla is a legally blind woman who has traveled extensively -- in part to show that she couldn't be defined by her disability, and in part to see as much of the world as she could before completely losing her sight. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By December 2018, Carla had traveled to about 20 countries by herself. She had studied Arabic in Egypt, worked with abandoned children in Yemen and traveled to remote villages in Indonesia to advocate for indigenous women. Her family said she had always dreamed of visiting Peru, but she hadn't gotten the chance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When her friend, Alicia Garcia Steele, told her she was going to travel to Lima to be the maid of honor at a wedding, Carla jumped at the opportunity to go with her. Carla's mom helped her pick out a navy blue dress and a pair of beige ballerina flats for the wedding.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After taking a bus and two plane rides from Detroit, Carla and Garcia Steele arrived in the bustling capital of Lima just in time to help with last-minute wedding details. They would later dance all night at the reception and celebrate Carla's birthday on the beach. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the last stretch of their two-week trip, Carla planned to travel alone to hike Machu Picchu, even after her friend advised her not to go by herself.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The day Carla left for her Machu Picchu trip, Garcia Steele grew nervous and kept texting her as the hours passed. She provided CNN with screengrabs of the messages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla are you there?""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla I'm so worried and have not heard anything from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Is everything ok?!?!""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Please please please write me when you can.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Carla. How are you. I'm dying to hear from you.""</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla replied -- more than 12 hours later -- she apologized, blaming the lack of Wi-Fi and her packed travel itinerary. Garcia Steele was glad to hear that Carla was OK, but something else in that text alarmed her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""I had a big issue that I need to resolve that I'll do it before I get home,""</em> Carla wrote. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This was one of the last times Garcia Steele would hear from her.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her friends and relatives were unable to reach her for a few days. They didn't panic until Carla missed her flight back to the United States.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her mom had just moved cross-country for her</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria, 66, had been living in Detroit for only a few months when Carla traveled to Peru. When Maria retired from her job as a victims' advocate for the Kendall County District Attorney in Texas, Carla asked her mom to move in with her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maria suspected her daughter's eyesight was worsening. Carla suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that causes a person's vision to deteriorate over time. After she was diagnosed at age 10, her mother pushed her to learn Braille and other skills that would prepare her to be fully blind. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla became very independent, living by herself, walking and biking around the city. She rarely talked about her blindness, and it was even more unusual for her to ask her mom for help. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within weeks of moving to Detroit to be with her daughter, Maria had learned all aspects of Carla's busy schedule: Her 6 a.m. trips to the gym, her work shift as a docent at the Arab American National Museum, the English as a Second Language classes she taught at a community center. Carla would write her plans on a whiteboard hanging in the entryway of their home, and if something changed, Carla would call her mom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's excitement about visiting Machu Picchu was palpable in her texts and the sound of her voice.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'll be thinking about you when I'm there,"" Maria remembered her daughter telling her during their last phone call on December 10.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A seasoned traveler quietly vanishes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After the wedding, Carla joined a group of Spanish and Argentinian travelers to hike Huayna Picchu, the steep mountain overlooking the famed ruins, and they returned together to Cusco a few hours later. The group -- still feeling the adrenaline rush -- had dinner together and danced for hours at a club before finally settling at a hostel for the night. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I can't wait to tell you all about it. It was absolutely worth 100%,"" she wrote to Garcia Steele in her last message to her on the night of December 11.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While her newfound friends were still asleep the next morning, her family said, a surveillance camera caught Carla taking a cab by herself outside the hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She didn't share her plans with anyone, her family said, but there is no doubt that she planned to come back. Before leaving, she sent a message to a friend saying she would be back in a few hours to hopefully visit some museums. She also left behind two bags with souvenirs, her medicine and her jacket.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later police would learn that she had taken two cabs. The first driver dropped Carla off at a Cusco street where people ride shared taxis headed to the Sacred Valley. The other driver said Carla was in his collective taxi and that she got off in the valley's first village -- Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>He left Texas behind to search the Peruvian Andes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father had been replacing the windows of an old home in Comfort, Texas, when he learned his daughter was missing -- three days after she was last seen. He booked a flight to Peru and drove 40 miles to the San Antonio airport to catch an eight-hour flight to Lima. From there, he flew over an hour to Cusco, and a police escort drove him for 40 minutes to Pisac through the curvy mountain roads of the Sacred Valley.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When he arrived in Pisac, he quickly learned that locals don't trust police. He spent days getting to know the residents of the town, and the people who regularly sell handcrafts in the main square and outside the park's entrance. They were and are still cordial with him, but he's not sure if they will ever trust him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has really been a nightmare since the beginning, a total nightmare,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He walked through the narrow cobbled streets of the colonial village looking for surveillance cameras, only to find a handful. Magnifying his exasperation, most of those cameras erase their footage every five days or so. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It had taken police more than a week to track down the information about the cab drivers who had taken her on the journey to Pisac.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What happened to Carla?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A camera outside a drugstore in Pisac captured the last known image of Carla. It shows her walking quickly with her green daypack and her silver folding cane for 14 seconds, about an hour after she left her hostel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She was heading in the direction of the Pisac Archaeological Park, a 9,063-hectare (22,395 acre) mountainside historic site known for its Incan ruins, tunnels, and massive agricultural terraces. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Carla's dad walked around the village's main square asking about his daughter, a woman selling traditional clothing and an employee of the local tourism information office said Carla had asked them for directions to the park. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A park employee later told police he saw Carla walking toward the entrance, but the park's ticket-taker couldn't confirm that. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, police pursued the theory that something had happened to Carla in the park, and that someone had hidden her body, or wild animals had devoured it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They flew drones over the park, sent in cadaver dogs and rescue teams, but they found nothing, said Peru National Police Colonel Carlos Manuel Valer Cruces, the man leading the investigation into Carla's disappearance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A team of Peruvian police detectives that handle missing persons and homicide cases are currently working together to find Carla, along with a special prosecutor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police now believe that Carla never made it into the park. They believe someone took or lured her to one of the many ritual sites in the region where tourists try an intensely hallucinogenic -- and sometimes deadly -- potion known as ayahuasca. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's family disputes that she would have wanted to take drugs. They believe Carla was sexually assaulted, kidnapped or was the victim of either human or organ trafficking. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I have no doubt in my mind that my sister was the victim of a crime,"" her brother said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Looking for his sister became his second job</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. and Carla -- born 11 months apart -- had the same friends growing up, went to the same schools in Texas and spent hours tubing on the Guadalupe River, talking about their future.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As his dad flew to Peru to search for his sister, Carlos studied maps of the Cusco region and answered dozens of phone calls from people reporting sightings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are not sleeping, you are not eating, you are not showering. You are just working constantly,"" Carlos Jr., 34, said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He can't leave his wife and months-old son -- or his job at a design fabrication studio -- indefinitely, but he has traveled to Peru from his home in Brooklyn, New York, at least three times, staying for weeks at a time to help his dad. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It just never feels like it's enough,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It makes you feel rotten inside that you can't grieve, you can't cry, you can't--"" he said, sobbing. ""You can't be there for your son, for your wife, because you have to do the job of the police.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She's not the only one missing</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An ocean away from the Valpeoz family, a woman heard about Carla's disappearance and burst into tears. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alexandra Ayala Leon, who lives in Seville, Spain, had never met Carla or anyone who knew her. But her own daughter had vanished in the same region of Peru, nearly a year before. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two men were arrested a few weeks after 28-year-old Nathaly Salazar Ayala went missing. They claimed she had died in a zip line accident and that they dumped her body in a river, yet her body has never been located.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ayala Leon felt helpless knowing another family was living through the same nightmare.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would not want them to suffer the same pain. Unfortunately, they're going through the same (situations) we experienced,"" said Ayala Leon, 49.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In long phone conversations with the Valpeoz family, Ayala Leon has guided them while they navigate through red tape, deal with calls from shamans looking to take advantage of them and look for experts to help in Carla's search. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She and Alisa Clamen of Canada, whose 22-year-old son, Jesse Galganov, disappeared while backpacking in the Peruvian mountains in 2017, have become like a second family for Carla's brother. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The pain is the same, different circumstances, but the pain is still there,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""I could never repay them for the amount of love, support and information that they've given me.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her family feels abandoned</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carlos Jr. has spent countless hours asking US politicians and the State Department to get more involved in finding his sister.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A lot of times it's really, really tough to get somebody on the other side of the line,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""Sometimes I have to wait days to get a phone call back.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""My family feels like we are just being abandoned,"" Carlos Jr. said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US Embassy officials continue telling the family they don't have jurisdiction in Peru to search for Carla. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A State Department spokesperson declined to discuss Carla's case, citing privacy considerations, and said the agency was ""aware of media reports of a US citizen missing in Cusco."" The spokesperson also referred all inquiries on the investigation to Peruvian authorities. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When a US citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts. The US Department of State and our embassies and consulates abroad have no greater responsibility than the protection of US citizens overseas,"" the spokesperson said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carla's father walks every other day to the police station in Cusco, trying to make sure Peruvian authorities are actively searching for his daughter. He's shared potential sightings and other tips from locals, but he can't be sure if detectives will act on them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Valer Cruces, the man leading the police investigation, said that US authorities have not offered local police any specific assistance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Their lives are changed forever</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Soon after Carla disappeared, Maria realized she couldn't stay in Detroit. She started to notice that everywhere she went -- the bank, the supermarket -- people recognized her and they stared at her with sadness. And she imagined she saw her daughter everywhere -- standing at every bus stop, walking on the streets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A few days after Christmas, she packed a small bag and traveled to Brooklyn. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For months, Maria fell asleep every night on the pink couch in her son's apartment, holding her daughter's grey knit sweater. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She can't find Carla herself, she said, but she can support her son and her husband while they look for her. She spends her days making baby purees from scratch and playing with her grandson. She has been paying off Carla's student loans and other bills, and recently had to go through Carla's possessions alone in preparation for selling her house.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now she's waiting for Carla in a small Brooklyn apartment that her son secured for her. Near her bed, she keeps a pocket-sized velvet picture frame with childhood photos of her children, alongside an image of the Virgin Mary.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since Carla disappeared, Carlos Jr. has celebrated his wife's birthday, takes any chance he gets to play with his son, and has started a new tradition with his mom: they'll stop by their neighborhood diner to eat cheeseburgers once a week.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm really trying to fill my life with things to do with my family,"" Carlos Jr. said. ""But at the end, I'm always thinking about Carla, the investigation, my dad, my mom. I can't escape it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thousands of miles away, Carlos Sr. wakes up every morning before sunrise ready to keep searching for Carla. He doesn't mind wearing the same few changes of clothes for weeks, the sickening altitude or the brutal sun. He'll be right there, far from home and alone, whether someone breaks their silence and calls police, whether his daughter's remains are found, or his prayers are answered and he is able to hug his daughter one more time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I need to take my daughter back,"" Valpeoz said.

Asked if he had a cocaine ""habit"", Gove said: ""No I don't believe it was.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The minister, who was previously Justice Secretary, said he has a ""profound sense of regret about it all.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Drug of the privileged</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The conventional wisdom in politics is any admission of drug-taking could finish off a <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/07/uk/theresa-may-conservative-leadership-luke-mcgee-intl-gbr/index.html"" target=""_blank"">person's career.</a> But that trend has been bucked in the past few decades. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before becoming US president, Bill Clinton in <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/03/politics/2020-marijuana-sex-work-gambling/index.html"" target=""_blank"">1992</a> tried to squirrel out of marijuana questions by saying he didn't inhale in the 1960s. Former British Prime Minister Cameron remained coy on the rumor that he had smoked<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jul/20/drugsandalcohol.immigrationpolicy"" target=""_blank""> a joint while at school. </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But cocaine is a harder drug than cannabis and has recently been blamed for a rise in violent crime in the United Kingdom. Last year, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, called middle-class cocaine users hypocrites for ""happily talking about global warming, fair trade, environmental protection and organic farming, but think there's no harm in taking a bit of cocaine,"" she said, according to <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/middle-class-drug-users-have-blood-on-their-hands-says-cressida-dick-fnnrmjb7x"" target=""_blank"">The Times newspaper. </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the United Kingdom, addictive and expensive powder is usually considered the drug of choice among the privileged. Gove's alleged use of it ""might reinforce the idea of the millionaire conservative,"" Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Green Party MP Caroline Lucas admonished the ""rank hypocrisy"" of Gove, who is a former justice minister, ""while backing policies that perpetuate harm. From locking up disproportionate number of young, black men, to treating drug misuse as crime rather than health issue, prohibition fails us all,"" she said on Twitter. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Past indiscretions </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, dismissed the news. ""I think people should tell us what they have done and move on in life,"" the Labour Party leader told Britain's Press Association. ""But I'm unconcerned about Michael Gove's past life or behavior, to be quite honest.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Raab, Gove's colleague, told BBC Radio 4's ""Today"" program he did not think the revelation would affect Gove's chances in the race. ""I certainly don't see it barring him from this race in any way. I rather admire his honesty,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Bale, the politics professor, added: ""I feel it is difficult to believe this will be a career-terminating event because there are so many other contenders who experimented when younger with soft or hard drugs.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The mixed response might be due to a move toward ""more honesty and authenticity"" in political campaigning, Bale said, adding that politicians are navigating an environment where the ease of sharing information online could be making it difficult for politicians to ""bolt the door"" on past indiscretions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even the top contender for the Conservative Party leadership, Boris Johnson, has previously admitted to trying cocaine and cannabis when he was a teenager. The 2007 revelation in GQ magazine is just one of the litany of Johnson's admitted indiscretions that has done little to shake his popularity among Conservative voters. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While it is hard to see the revelation killing off Gove's political career, it may scupper his chances among the 160,000 card-carrying members of the Conservative Party, who have the ultimate say on who will be the leader.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a statement to the Daily Mail, Gove said the decision rests in the hands of ""my colleagues in Parliament and members of the Conservative Party to decide now if I should be leader.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think all politicians have lives before politics,"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But with Conservative Party members being ""older and more socially conservative than the average voter,"" Bale said, Gove might be out of luck. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Sarah Dean and Kieron Mirchandani contributed to this report. </p>]"

Wendy's confusion only risks making the seemingly inevitable showdown more personal, but it has always seemed like this is a Thunderdome situation, where two men enter, only one leaves, and neither comes away unscarred.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Billions"" wasn't conceived for what might be called the Trump era of television, but the show has felt <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/12/entertainment/billions-and-the-good-fight-trump-era-dramas/index.html"" target=""_blank"">perfectly calibrated</a> to it, with money and the levers of government as the ultimate paths to power. Thanks to the cast and sharp writing, it's great fun to watch as a soap opera, while simultaneously operating on a more elevated track.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The entire season, in fact, has been about playing angles and calling in favors by people who play Monopoly with real buildings and seldom worry much about collateral damage. It's a world of privilege where winning is the goal, but victories are always sweeter when they come directly at someone else's expense.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Throwing Axe and Chuck together offered a clever means to prolong the seemingly inevitable collision, but the series now appears to be squarely back on that road.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""No one's left standing,"" Chuck muses near the end of the episode.

It is a mastery unmatched by any tennis player on any surface in any era. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Winning a grand slam isn't easy. Winning 12 French titles is beyond belief,"" tweeted Rod Laver, who presented Nadal with the Coupe des Mousquetaires. Laver achieved the calendar year grand slam twice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal improved to 93-2 at the French Open and has never lost a final. Or even been taken to five sets. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem and other players must have been buoyed when Nadal -- coming off another knee injury -- began the clay-court swing poorly by his standards. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He admitted to doing some serious soul searching at the Barcelona Open in April after being, atypically, negative on court in an opening round win. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""After the first round in Barcelona, I was able to stay alone for a couple of hours in a room and think about it and think about what's going on, what I need to do,"" he said. ""And (there were) a couple of issues that I had to decide, no? One possibility was to stop for a while and recover my body. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""And the other was to change drastically my attitude and my mentality to play the next couple of weeks.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He picked the latter and beat Novak Djokovic in the Rome final last month for a considerable boost. Roland Garros was the grander exclamation mark. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Within two of Federer</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the first time, Nadal pulled to within two grand slams of Roger Federer, the man he eased past in their headline semifinal Friday. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the 37-year-old Swiss doesn't win another major, Nadal could get to 20 just by wracking up more victories at Roland Garros. As he has said before, though, he doesn't obsess about equaling Federer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I am not very worried about this stuff, no?"" Nadal said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You can't be frustrated all the time because the neighbor has a bigger house than you or a bigger TV or better garden. That's not the way that I see life.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For the third straight season, the unfortunate Thiem lost to Nadal at the French Open after defeating him in a warmup.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He thus knows first hand the difference between trying to overcome Nadal over three sets compared to five. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That Thiem was able to make matters competitive is a credit to him -- three of the four sets were close, regardless of the final two set scores. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem ended the tournament playing four straight days thanks to the rain in what was a huge disadvantage for the bottom half of the draw. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Who knows what would have happened if he had the usual day off between the semifinal and final.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem's coach, Nicolas Massu, asked organizers to push the final to Monday to level the playing field but was told there was ""no chance."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Indeed, Saturday was about the perfect day for Nadal. Thiem battled for an intense three hours against world No. 1 Djokovic in the completion of their weather affected semifinal -- and won. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unquestionably he would have preferred Thiem to Djokovic, one of those two players to have derailed Nadal at the French Open and the left-hander's toughest all-time opponent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Great effort from Thiem</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And especially a weakened Thiem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem, very well liked among his peers, is never one for excuses but admitted to feeling the effects of Saturday's thriller. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It was a grand slam final, so I didn't feel tired in the match,"" he said. ""But at the same time, a match like yesterday, beating Novak over two days with all the interruptions, it leaves traces on the body and also on the mind. That's 100%.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem -- who stretched Nadal to a five-set epic last year at the US Open -- said Saturday adrenaline would aid in his efforts to put up a fight against the spin master. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It wasn't simply fighting talk. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He possesses a brilliant combination of pace and power and more than once in the early going in intermittent sun, Thiem commendably chased balls and offered up defensive lobs to neutralize the Mallorcan. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His first set performance gave no hint of the struggle with Djokovic. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem trailed by an early break in the 2018 final but on this occasion, the 25-year-old broke first for 3-2 courtesy of his powerhouse forehand. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What wasn't in the script was to get broken in the next game. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was a momentum changing two games but an even more important one was to come.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an extended 10-minute game, Nadal saved a break point to hold for 4-3. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Reeling, Thiem dropped serve, the game highlighted by Nadal chasing a fine Thiem drop shot and then replying with his own drop shot winner. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>First set key</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal was 84-0 at the French Open when winning the first set so it spelled big trouble for Thiem.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fans on Philippe Chatrier took turns chanting ""Rafa, Rafa"" and ""Dominic, Dominic,"" and were rewarded with another sparkling set. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Not phased by losing a 55-minute first set, Thiem's level didn't diminish. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Both men held comfortably without a break point in sight until Thiem conjured two in the 12th game. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And when Nadal sent his backhand long, he claimed his first set in their four Roland Garros duels. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Could he keep it going? Further, would Nadal respond? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The answer came quickly. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After a lengthy bathroom break, Nadal stormed to the first 11 points and tallied a double break advantage with a reflex forehand pass. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The spectators loved it and so did Nadal, who produced a multiple fist pump. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""After the first two sets, I dropped a little bit my level"" and then Nadal ""stepped on me,"" conceded Thiem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal was now rolling, orchestrating a stunning backhand drop volley that earned a thumbs up from the Austrian. He won 23 of 27 net points, often approaching behind potent groundstrokes.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Almost everybody will tell you that he's one of the best volleyers of our game,"" Thiem said, before jokingly adding ""because the last time he missed a volley was maybe seven years ago."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He wrapped up the third with a sizzling 10 winners and two unforced errors. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One felt the exertions of the last few days were finally catching up to Thiem by this point but the fourth set wasn't a formality. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal saved a break point in the first game with a trademark forehand winner, broke and saved two more break points to lead 3-0. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A thinker</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For many Nadal's power and resilience are what catches the eye. But he is a thinker, too. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the first break point at 30-40, he struck a good serve to Thiem's backhand and the return went into the net. On the second, he changed direction and went down the middle with pace to prompt a forehand miscue. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadal sealed the final on the stroke of three hours when another Thiem return sailed long. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He sunk to the clay, on his back, before exchanging a hug with Thiem. The two share a healthy respect. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a city filled with one boulangerie after another, Nadal tries for a baker's dozen of French Open titles in 2020. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

You might find <a href=""https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2s598w"" target=""_blank"">you're gonna like it here</a>. There are many reasons why: </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The mishaps</strong> </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Broadway stars can gloss over flubbed lines or missed cues so well you'd never notice unless you wrote the show yourself. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, a dead microphone (for none other than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBfHHVHqYrQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10"" target=""_blank"">Sir Elton John</a>) and lyrical slips are a bit more obvious when 6.3 million people are watching. And when we do catch a rare glimpse, they're glorious peeks behind the curtain. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Who can forget the moment<strong> </strong>Bret Michaels, waltzing to the back of the stage (or upstage, if you're a theater geek) after a triumphant performance with the cast of Best Musical nom ""Rock of Ages,"" was taken out by a flying set piece? It fractured his nose <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-xpm-2012-may-15-la-et-cm-poison-singer-bret-michaels-settles-suit-over-tony-awards-injury-20120515-story.html"" target=""_blank"">and he sued</a>, but in the moment before audiences knew he was hurt, it was magic. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And at the Tonys, no one would dare mispronounce the name of Broadway's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5V9KwppMfs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=10"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Green</a>, Idina Menzel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The performances</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Tonys numbers are testaments to the physical and emotional feat of stage acting ... and singing and dancing, usually at once. There are also far more of them: the 2019 Tonys have no fewer than 10 musical numbers lined up from nominated musicals. Plays are sometimes shafted when it comes to on-air coverage, but the highlight reels contain more drama than any of the snippets played after Oscar nominees' names. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Not every fan can afford a flight to New York and a front row seat, so the actors on the Tonys bring as much sweat, purpose and talent to their five minutes onscreen as they do when they're singing it onstage every night. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Viewers remember the moment in 2002 they discovered Sutton Foster, starring in one of the snappiest tap numbers ever broadcast from ""Thoroughly Modern Millie."" There was Andrew Rannells as a springy Mormon missionary, affirming his faith on an empty stage. And, of course, Cynthia Erivo cemented her status as a soon-to-be legend as Celie from ""The Color Purple,"" shining as the brightest star in a segment that included Oprah.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And then there was Neil Patrick Harris' opening number from the 2013 awards. He seamlessly commanded a nearly 8 1/2-minute epic that included a posse of drag queens, live magic tricks and a soulful, one-breath ode to the theater kids with professional dreams watching at home. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The stars, familiar and new</strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Lin Manuel Miranda shone before anyone knew him as Bert the chimney sweep or the man behind ""Moana."" He was nominated for Best Actor and won Best Score for Best Musical winner ""In the Heights"" 11 years ago (he's used to bests). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before James Corden monetized car sing-alongs, he won for his bumbling role in ""One Man, Two Guvnors."" Before the serialized story of her life became Emmy fodder, Gwen Verdon broke through and won her first Tony of many for ""Can-Can."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Did you know ""Black Panther's"" Okoye, Danai Gurira, wrote Best Play nominee ""Eclipsed,"" which starred Lupita Nyong'o? What about fashion frontiersman Billy Porter, who won Best Actor for a similarly well-dressed performance in ""Kinky Boots?"" Even Amy Schumer was nominated ... for her work in a play by Steve Martin.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Tonys welcome home actors who've strayed to the West Coast, too: Glenn Close, Denzel Washington, Hugh Jackman, Bryan Cranston, Viola Davis, Helen Mirren. In fact, five of the last nine Best Actress in a Play winners have also won Academy Awards. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The speeches </strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The second-hand joy of watching talented artists win an award -- for their first time onstage or at the end of a long career -- is never more palpable than it is here. Watching the uncrackable stage presence slip once their name is announced, the genuine shock on their faces, the tears, the shakes, the accidental profanities -- it all feels as real as theater does when you watch it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most memorable moments are often buried in acceptance speeches. After winning for ""Hamilton's"" score, Miranda's sonnet for his wife and the victims killed hours earlier at the Pulse nightclub shooting reminded viewers that love is love (is love is love). Kelli O'Hara, frequent nom and first-time winner, shuffled off stage in glee. Cicely Tyson reflected on her family and career in a grateful, glowing speech for her first Tony. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3><strong>The shows </strong></h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Tonys have a ways to go before being declared more ""diverse"" than the Academy Awards. But nominees of late have shared perspectives often unexplored anywhere else. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Recent Best Musical winners have included a tale of Arabs and Jews connecting through music, an all-minority cast (except for one, as Britain's King George III) playing slaveowners and founding fathers, and a coming-of-age and coming-out story of a lesbian cartoonist. All were adapted for the stage, but that's where they shone brightest. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Google says it will eventually allow people to play games directly over WiFi from any TV with Chromecast, computer with a Chrome browser, and Google Pixel phones. There are no downloads as the games themselves exist <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/tech/google-looker/index.html"" target=""_blank"">on Google cloud servers</a>. That means Stadia can also sync game progress across devices. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Google is only releasing a limited version of the system in November, however. Stadia will work on TVs with a Chromecast dongle or Chromecast support at launch. Those on computers or mobile devices are out of luck until 2020. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">People will have to buy a special subscription bundle if they want to play this year: The $129.99 Founder's Edition will include a Stadia controller, a Chromecast dongle, three months of a Stadia streaming subscription, and a free pass so a friend can also play for three months. The company is taking pre-orders for the Founder's Edition now.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stadia will launch in 14 countries in November, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, France, and Italy. Google plans to expand it to more countries next year. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Next year, Google will release a regular streaming subscription called Stadia Pro, which will cost $9.99 a month and include access to 31 games and counting, including Destiny 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 3, and Rage 2.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It will also offer a free-to-play version of Stadia, with a lower resolution. People have to pay for the titles they want. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Chrome browser and Pixel 3 and 3a support is also rolling out next year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Michael Pachter, an analyst at financial services firm Wedbush, told CNN Business that the current game selection of 31 titles is underwhelming. ""It's analogous to a buffet that has only 31 dishes; if they don't have what you want, they won't get your business,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google told CNN Business that individual game publishers will announce more Stadia-compatible titles at the annual E3 video game conference, including new and highly anticipated releases. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Similar streaming services have failed in the past, Pachter wrote in an analyst note. Cloud gaming services like GameTap and OnLive did not taken off among gamers. OnLive was ultimately discontinued and GameTap was sold to a new company, where it still lives today. (GameTap was originally part of Turner Broadcasting, which is now WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The problem is in how much companies can charge for a subscription service, according to Pachter. Charge $20 a month, and they can get better access to third-party content but gamers won't bite. Charge $10, and the offerings will be paltry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, there's hope for Google, analysts say. The company's free version of Stadia won't require people to buy a separate console and could be attractive. Pachter predicts that the storefront business model will be ""immensely successful."" ""Publishers would likely embrace this model and we see few impediments to its success,"" he wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google has invested a lot into Stadia. It launched its own Stadia Games and Entertainment studio to make Stadia games. A spokesperson said original content could be available starting next year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google also recently hired Jade Raymond, a Google VP who previously worked at Sony, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-raymond-121395/?originalSubdomain=ca"" target=""_blank"">according to her LinkedIn</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But its competitors are gearing up for a fight. Microsoft's upcoming xCloud game streaming service <a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/08/project-xcloud-gaming-with-you-at-the-center/"" target=""_blank"">is still being tested</a>, and it's possible the company will provide an update at E3.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Analysts anticipate Amazon potentially releasing its own streaming-game service by the end of the year. It would be different from the Amazon-owned Twitch, which lets people watch others play video games.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Laine Nooney, assistant professor and historian of video games at New York University, said that while Stadia has the advantage of being first to market with cloud streaming, Google still has to figure out who it's serving. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Does Google think it can pull players from Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo, companies that have defined what it means to be a gamer for 20 or 30 years? Or is Google hoping to...open up new player markets?"" said Nooney. ""It seems like Google is hoping to have it both ways.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

A version of this story was published in The Conversation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad Paragraph__isDropCap"">For nearly a century, a massive mural by painter Victor Arnautoff titled ""The Life of Washington"" has lined the hallways of San Francisco's George Washington High School.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It may not be there much longer.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Washington High School's Reflection and Action Working Group -- an ad-hoc committee made up students, school employees and local artists, historians and Native Americans -- believes the mural ""glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, manifest destiny, white supremacy (and) oppression,"" according to a statement <a href=""https://thefrisc.com/at-sfs-washington-high-an-83-year-old-mural-depicting-slaves-and-a-dead-native-american-is-again-b2b576bdf5da"" target=""_blank"">published</a> in local media.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The group reportedly identified two panels as especially offensive. One shows Washington pointing westward next to the body of a dead Native American (pictured above). The other depicts slaves working in the fields of Mount Vernon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Because the work ""traumatizes students and community members,"" the group's statement concluded that ""the impact of this mural is greater than its intent ever was."" They are campaigning for its removal.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The idea that impact matters more than intention has informed debates about everything from microaggressions to cultural appropriation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But when it comes to art, should impact matter more than intention?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As historians committed to preserving our cultural heritage -- and as citizens invested in the power of art to engage the public -- we see the growing chorus of voices favoring impact over intention as a dangerous trend, one that makes art more vulnerable to rejection, censorship or even destruction.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>A radical work for its time</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">For most members of the Washington High School's Reflection and Action Group, the only message ""The Life of Washington"" sends is one of crushing, dehumanizing oppression.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">What happens, though, when we examine the mural in the context of the life and times of the artist?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Painter Victor Arnautoff was born in 1896 in a small village in present-day Ukraine. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1925, where he joined a leftist art collective. During the Great Depression he was a supporter of workers' strikes and formally joined the Communist Party in 1937. He was even hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 for drawing a ""Communist Conspiracy"" cartoon that caricatured then-Vice President Nixon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In ""The Life of Washington,"" Arnautoff decided to place Native Americans, African Americans and working-class revolutionaries front and center in the four largest panels, relegating Washington to the margins.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The slaves toiling in the Mount Vernon fields highlight a central paradox of America's history: The nation was founded by men who championed liberty, freedom and equality, and yet owned slaves.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Then there's the striking image of the fallen Native American. The mural's detractors say that it dismisses the humanity of indigenous peoples. But why must it necessarily be read as dehumanizing to Native Americans? Could it not instead be seen as throwing into sharp relief the inhumanity of the founding fathers?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In his biography of Arnautoff, Robert W. Cherny, wrote that the image challenged the fallacy that ""westward expansion had been into largely vacant territory waiting for white pioneers to develop its full potential.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">There's a <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/san-francisco-high-school-may-destroy-historical-murals"" target=""_blank"">strong case</a> to be made that Arnautoff is exposing -- rather than celebrating -- slavery and genocide. As Native American Tamaka Bailey, of the Choctaw Nation, <a href=""https://twitter.com/tamaka3715/status/1127996787283775489"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: the murals ""do not glorify slavery but prove that (Washington) was a slave-owner"" and ""part of the Genocide of First Nation Peoples."" Moreover, those arguing for the mural's removal are overlooking the fact that African Americans are not only portrayed as picking cotton and that Native Americans are not only depicted as victims. Rather Arnautoff is insisting that African Americans and indigenous peoples were key historical actors in the making of the United States.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">That the mural appears in a school is particularly important. For decades, the country's educational institutions perpetuated national myths about American exceptionalism and American history as one long glorious march of forward progress. Up until the 1960s, the standard US history curriculum ignored the country's dark and terrifying history of racial violence, including enslavement and the slaughter of indigenous peoples. So drawing attention to the horrors inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans would have been a radical statement in 1930s America.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Many of those in favor of scrapping the murals seem to believe that merely depicting past atrocities justifies them. In fact, the Action and Reflection Working Group concluded that the mural contravened the San Francisco Unified School District's commitment to ""social justice.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Quite to the contrary. In our view, the ""Life of Washington"" is an invaluable resource for students to engage in a serious and sustained way with social justice issues. It provides a singular opportunity to cultivate historical literacy and to equip students with the skills to analyze and discuss difficult material. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">From new student orientation to classes in art, history and civics, this mural should be formally incorporated into the George Washington High School curriculum. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>Only the latest controversy</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The controversy over this mural is sadly not an isolated exception.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Over the past several years, there have been dozens of cases where plays, poems, books, prints, paintings, sculptures, installations and other creative works have been shut down, canceled, removed or otherwise censored based on snap judgments, social media swarms, ideologically motivated reasoning and obtuse interpretations of the art in question.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In all of these cases, there has been little to no regard for the aspirations, aims and ambitions of the artists themselves. Their intentions have been treated along a spectrum that runs from indifference to contempt.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">To be clear, we are not saying that an artist's intent is all that matters. How people interpret and respond to a work of art is inseparable from its raison d'etre.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But disregarding the intentions of artists would place every significant creative work with a whiff of controversy in jeopardy because of its ""problematic"" or ""offensive"" content. In a world where intentionality and context are irrelevant, satire and irony would not only be incomprehensible but forbidden.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Mark Twain's frequent invocation of the n-word in ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""? Just a vicious rehearsal of a profoundly damaging racial slur. Artist Kara Walker's searing paper cuts depicting the horrific violence of slavery in the United States? Nothing more than a celebration of the white domination of black bodies. Keegan-Michael Key's brilliant sketch character Luther who serves as Obama's ""anger translator""? Simply a racist caricature of the ""angry black man.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>What else becomes vulnerable to censorship?</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Calls to censor ""offensive"" art by committees, petitions or the Twitterverse are especially dangerous. For every case of ""righteous"" censorship that removes works of art that are allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic and so on, there will be scores more censored on the grounds that they are anti-American or offensive to Christians.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As the American Library Association <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/blog/whose-books-are-banned"" target=""_blank"">reports</a>, the most frequently challenged and banned books are those that contain ""diverse content"" and include characters of color or address themes of sexuality, racism, religion, disability and mental illness. Four out of the top 11 most <a href=""http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10"" target=""_blank"">challenged or banned books</a> in 2018 were objected to on the basis of their LGBT content. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""Two Boys Kissing"" -- a 2013 novel centered around the lives of seven gay teenagers -- has made the American Library Association list for several years running, even though The Guardian <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/16/review-david-levithan-two-boys-kissing"" target=""_blank"">described</a> it as a ""complex,"" ""intricate"" novel ""so extremely powerful (it) leaves you thinking long, long after you have finished reading it.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Thinking long and hard, alas, is in short supply for members of the ""we are not interested in the artist's intentions"" brigade, to quote a recent <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/mr-president-of-the-french-national-assembly-ladies-and-gentlemen-honorable-members-of-the-national-assembly-say-no-to-racism-on-the-walls-of-the-french-national-assembly"" target=""_blank"">petition</a> calling for the removal of a large fresco, also deemed racist, at France's National Assembly. Ripping art from its context degrades our critical faculties and imprisons us in the present. It smacks of a literal-minded authoritarianism that assumes and indeed insists that a creative work can and must only be read in one way.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">When people refuse to see the contradictions, tensions and ambiguities of art, it becomes disposable.

The report says Palmer became agitated as a result of ""methamphetamine toxicity."" A probable ""sickling red cell disorder"" as listed as a contributing factor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to his family, Palmer never had any health problems leading up to his death.

Whether it is performed by laser or the old-fashioned way, it's a surgery during which nearly all of the cat's first-toe bones, along with the tendons and ligaments, are removed. This brutal, permanent disfigurement leaves many cats with <a href=""https://www.drmartybecker.com/veterinary-medicine/the-tragedy-of-post-declaw-pain-syndrome-and-how-to-help-cats-who-suffer-from-it/"" target=""_blank"">chronic, lifelong pain</a>, much like amputees who experience phantom pain associated with their lost limbs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike human amputation, which is most often performed to save a life, cats are declawed to save a couch or the curtains.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cats scratch things. Like purring and meowing, scratching is an instinct, something cats are born to do. Denying cats the ability to satisfy one of their most basic behaviors is cruel. It also causes many cats to experience a variety of <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523124130.htm"" target=""_blank"">negative side effects</a>, including aggression and depression. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many declawed cats resort to <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1098612X17705044"" target=""_blank"">biting and litter box avoidance or both</a>. Imagine coming home from 10 toe bone amputations and then having to dig in the litter box gravel or being robbed of your first line of defense, your nails, and having to use your teeth instead. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biting is much more likely than scratching to <a href=""https://admin.avma.org/News/Journals/Collections/Documents/javma_234_3_336.pdf"" target=""_blank"">transmit dangerous bacteria</a> to immuno-compromised cat lovers, which is why health <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/bartonella/cat-scratch/index.html"" target=""_blank"">authorities don't recommend</a> cat declawing to protect people with compromised immune systems. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The behavioral issues that result from declawing cause families to surrender their cats to shelters. If people can't tolerate a little bit of cat scratching, they certainly won't tolerate aggression, biting, depression and litter box avoidance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though the law in most states, including New York, still <a href=""https://aldf.org/issue/animals-legal-status/"" target=""_blank"">considers animals property</a>, we know better.

The entire size of the Chinese economy is estimated to be around $13 trillion, so it's impossible for it to lose more than it is worth. On top of that, China's economy has continued to expand during Trump's time in office. </em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">China's GDP growth has remained above 6% since Trump was elected in November 2016. While Chinese economic growth has started to slow, that trend was already underway before Trump was elected.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In <a href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN"" target=""_blank"">2017</a>, China's GDP was $12.238 trillion, according to the World Bank. While current estimates are hard to come by, China's economy grew by 6.6% in 2018, which would put the size of the economy just over $13 trillion.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If China were to lose $15 to $20 trillion it would completely wipe the country off the face of the world's economic map.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The bigger point Trump seems to be making here is that his trade policies are hurting China's economy. That at least does carry a kernel of truth. (As <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/fact-check-trump-tariff-china/index.html"" target=""_blank"">economist</a>s have <a href=""https://taxfoundation.org/trade-china-tariffs-economic-impact/"" target=""_blank"">noted</a>, however, the US economy is harmed by these tariffs as well.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since his first round of tariffs against China went into effect last summer, US imports from China have dropped sharply, as companies have begun to switch their sourcing to other East Asian countries like Vietnam. In the first 4 months of 2019, Americans <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/tariffs-us-manufacturing-vietnam/index.html"" target=""_blank"">imported</a> about 12% less from China compared to the same period last year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the research firm Capital Economics, the 25% tariff on all Chinese goods that Trump is set to impose could shave 0.8 percentage points off China's GDP. Just under half of that GDP decrease, Capital Economics estimates, should have already happened due to lower tariffs on intermediate goods such as steel. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over the course of a year, this estimated 0.8% hit could account for roughly $100 billion dollars -- nowhere near Trump's $15 to $20 trillion figure.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>French wine</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump hinted at potential action against France over the price of wine during his phone interview with CNBC.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You know, France charges us a lot for the wine. And yet we charge them very little for (American) wine. So the wineries come to me and say, 'Sir,' the California guys they come, 'Sir, we're paying a lot of money to put our product into France and you're letting, meaning this country, is allowing this French wine -- which are some great wines, but we have great wines too -- allowing it to come in for nothing. It's not fair,'"" Trump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""And you know what? It's not fair. We'll do something about it,"" he continued.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>Facts First: </strong><em>This isn't quite true. While US tariffs on wine from the European Union are smaller than the EU's tariff on American wine, according to the Wine Institute, contrary to what Trump said, the US does not allow French wine ""to come in for nothing."" </em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The EU's import tariff on wine for a 750 ml bottle ""can range from $0.11 to 0.29, depending on the type alcoholic content of the wine,"" the Institute <a href=""https://www.wineinstitute.org/international_trade_policy"" target=""_blank"">states</a>. By comparison, ""the US import tariff on a 750 ml bottle is $0.05 for still wine and $0.14 for sparkling wine.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And while the US and EU maintain a 2006 agreement on wine trade, the institute argues that the EU has since ""created certain restrictions that increase costs or otherwise affect the ability of US wine to compete in the EU."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One main restriction comes in the form of a certification for wine imports from the US. The US doesn't have similar certification for French wine imports.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another restriction that makes it more difficult for American wine producers to sell in Europe is a limit on the use of common wine descriptors, including ""chateau,"" ""clos,"" ""tawny,"" and ""ruby"" for their products.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What Trump will actually do about the price of wine is unclear, but the President threatened tariffs on France's wines -- part of a larger tariff threat against the European Union -- late last year. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!"" Trump tweeted last November.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">European wine and cheese were also among the goods the US Trade Representative's office threatened to place tariffs on in <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/04/09/trump-administration-threatens-tariffs-eu-wine-cheese-other-goods-europe-has-many-questions/?utm_term=.f291a9847719"" target=""_blank"">April</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>China's currency manipulation </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump contradicted his own Treasury Department by calling China a currency manipulator weeks after the agency skipped slapping that label on the Asian giant. ""They devalue their currency. They have for years. It's put them at a tremendous competitive advantage,"" the President said during his interview on CNBC before proceeding to attack the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates in the US. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>Facts First:</strong> <em>China's currency has fallen 9% against the US dollar over the past year, according to one economic research firm, but its recent depreciation didn't trigger the US government taking the rare step of formally labeling Beijing a currency manipulator last month.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Speaking to CNBC, Trump said the sharp decline in China's currency ""absolutely"" needs to be addressed as the yuan has depreciated to help offset tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods amid an ongoing trade war between the two major economic superpowers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Economists appear to agree that the weaker currency -- whether by design or not -- has softened the blow of tariffs on China by making its goods cheaper. But it also raises the risk that the trade dispute could spiral into a currency war.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A research note by Capital Economics released Monday points out that the weaker currency has ""provided a cushion since the first tariffs came in,"" adding that the yuan is ""9% weaker against the dollar and 6% in trade-weighted terms since this time last year.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A further leg down is likely if China's leaders conclude that there is little point in holding out for a deal,"" according to the report. ""If President Trump goes ahead with the threatened 25% tariff on the remainder of China's goods, we believe that the renminbi would be allowed to weaken.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Sunday, People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang acknowledged the weakness in his country's currency in an exclusive <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-09/china-central-banker-signals-no-specific-yuan-level-important"" target=""_blank"">interview with Bloomberg News</a>, suggesting that it was indeed a result of the trade war with the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is obviously a link between the trade war and the movements of renminbi,"" Yi said in the interview in Beijing. ""Recently, it's a little bit weaker, because of the tremendous pressure from the US side."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In late May, the <a href=""https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/206/2019-05-28-May-2019-FX-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Treasury Department declined once again to label China a currency manipulator</a>, despite Trump's pledge to do so during his 2016 campaign. Instead, the country was placed on Treasury's ""monitoring list"" in its review of US trading partners along with eight other countries.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To be fair, Treasury's report highlighted ""significant concerns"" over the meaningful depreciation of China's currency against the US dollar, a critical component of ongoing trade talks, and urged China to take steps to avoid ""a persistently weak currency.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Treasury will continue its enhanced bilateral engagement with China regarding exchange rate issues, given that the RMB has fallen against the dollar by eight percent over the last year in the context of an extremely large and widening bilateral trade surplus,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a statement in May.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, the Treasury Department said that while China doesn't disclose its foreign exchange interventions, it estimates that direct intervention by the People's Bank of China in the last year has been ""limited.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mnuchin met with China's central bank governor, Yi, over the weekend on the sidelines of the G20 economic summit in Fukuoka, Japan. In a tweet, Mnuchin described the meeting as ""constructive"" with a ""candid discussion on trade issues."" It's unclear if the two men discussed currency issues.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Immigration deal </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At another point in his CNBC interview, Trump said that the US ""got everything we wanted"" out of negotiations with Mexico last week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President threatened to slap tariffs on Mexico if the country didn't step up immigration enforcement and prevent more migrants from crossing into the US from the southern border illegally. High-level negotiations between the US and Mexico ensued in Washington last week, and the two countries signed onto a joint declaration agreeing to several immigration enforcement provisions, ceasing the pursuit of tariffs Friday night.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We got everything we wanted and we're going to be a great partner to Mexico now, because now they respect us. They didn't even respect us,"" Trump told CNBC. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>Facts First: </strong><em>Trump's claim that the US ""got everything we wanted"" in negotiations misconstrues what we know about the bilateral negotiations. One key element of negotiations is about so called ""safe state status"" and Trump's statements were misleading on the scope and timeline of that provision.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump also touted that the US is ""going to be essentially using to a large extent, the very powerful immigration laws of Mexico, and Mexico wants to do a good job. They're moving 6,000 soldiers to their southern border.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Do you think they agreed to do that before?"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But despite Trump's suggestion that the provisions are new, the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html"" target=""_blank"">New York Times </a>reported that the US and Mexico had <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/08/politics/nyt-trump-mexico-agreed-deal-months-ago/index.html"" target=""_blank"">agreed months earlier</a> to some of the border policies described in last week's joint declaration.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Mexican government had pledged to deploy the National Guard nationwide with a focus on its southern border -- a key part of Friday's agreement -- during secret meetings in March between former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Mexican interior secretary Olga Sanchez in Miami, US and Mexican officials familiar with the negotiations told the Times.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The deal's key expansion of a program that would keep asylum seekers in Mexico while their claims are processed was established in two heavily brokered diplomatic notes exchanged between the two countries, the Times reported. Nielsen announced the Migrant Protection Protocols during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in late December.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump disputed the Times' story in a series of tweets Sunday morning, writing that his administration, like others before it, had been working toward some aspects of the deal ""for a long time,"" but said they ""were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Companies leaving China? </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During the interview, Trump suggested that Beijing will agree to a deal because the tariffs he's imposed on Chinese goods are driving away business.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""China deal's going to work out, you know why? Because of tariffs. Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>Facts First: </strong><em>This is a bit of an overstatement. There is evidence that US importers are shifting part of their production outside China since Trump imposed tariffs, but little shows that there's a mass exodus of companies that are relocating entirely away from China -- a process that would likely take years.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/economy/china-tariffs-goods-expensive/index.html"" target=""_blank"">currently</a> tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods, giving US importers an incentive to find suppliers outside of China to avoid paying the tariff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trade data published by the US Census Bureau last week suggests that they are <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/tariffs-us-manufacturing-vietnam/"" target=""_blank"">buying more</a> from other Asian countries, while importing about 12% less from China this year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US imports are up 38% from Vietnam, 22% from Taiwan, 17% from South Korea, and 13% from Bangladesh, during the first four months of 2019 compared to last year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While those are significant increases, some production was already moving outside of China -- to places with even lower wages -- long before Trump began imposing tariffs. US imports from countries like Vietnam and South Korea have been steadily increasing over the past decade as those countries ramped up manufacturing of apparel and electronics, respectively. Plus, the United States imports more overall when the economy is strong.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, it's unclear whether companies are genuinely shifting production outside of China, or simply rerouting goods for minimal processing before being shipped to the US. The uptick in imports from Vietnam and Taiwan suggests that at least partially explains what is happening, according to a report from Capital Economics, a research consulting firm based in London.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Plus, it's not always easy to find a supplier outside of China that can manufacture the same good, with the same quality, and for a cheaper price. Instead, an importer may decide to eat the cost, betting that Trump will lift the tariffs sooner rather than later. They can also choose to pass the cost on to consumers for the time being.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About 60% of companies <a href=""https://www.amcham-shanghai.org/sites/default/files/2019-05/Joint_survey_on_tariffs_May_2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">surveyed</a> last month by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) and its counterpart in Shanghai said they have no plans to relocate manufacturing outside of China because of the tariffs.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""><em>This story has been updated.</em></p>]"

Do the math and you get this: The President of the United States is saying 12 untrue things a day.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Which is a lot! But it's also hard to wrap your head around how much lying or, uh, misleading that actually is. So, think about it this way: Trump is lying more every day than a majority of Americans wash their hands. According to data from the American Cleaning Institute,<a href=""https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/newsroom/surveys/92109-summary"" target=""_blank""> just 50% of Americans wash their hands in excess of 10 times a day</a>. (Not for nothing: <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/features/handwashing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Here's the CDC's guidelines on proper handwashing</a>!)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Try this thought experiment: Every time you wash your hands for the rest of the day -- after using the restroom, before you eat etc. -- think of that as the President of the United States saying something that isn't true. For more than half of you, that won't even equal the number of times Trump doesn't tell the truth every day of his presidency (including weekends!).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's willingness to bend and break the truth isn't new. Since becoming a candidate for president way back in 2015, Trump has shown a remarkable capacity for creating his own reality, a reality that often doesn't comport with established facts. The pace at which he misleads has increased as his presidency has gone on. So too has his willingness to directly question the idea of whether capital ""T"" truth even exists.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Stick with us. Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news,"" <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/25/politics/donald-trump-vfw-unreality/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump told the annual VFW convention in 2018</a>. ""What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this month when asked about Meghan Markle's 2016 comment that she would move to Canada if Trump won, the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/politics/donald-trump-meghan-markle-nasty-boris-johnson-good-prime-minister/index.html"" target=""_blank"">President said this</a>: ""I didn't know that she was nasty. I hope she is OK.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within 24 hours of making the initial comment, Trump <a href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1135165268261519361"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: ""I never called Meghan Markle 'nasty.' Made up by the Fake News Media, and they got caught cold! Will @CNN, @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, yeah. This a feature, not a glitch.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It is also the defining trait of Trump's presidency to date, and, I think, the likeliest legacy he will leave behind -- whether he is president through 2020 or 2024. What Trump has done -- through both the audaciousness of his lies, their frequency and his assault on the media as a neutral referee -- is made it virtually impossible for the average person to credibly delineate between what's true and what's merely political spin.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump has effectively created a self-fulfilling falsehood machine. It works like this:</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">1.  He says something that is either misleading or totally refuted by known facts</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">2. The media fact-checks him, noting said known facts as evidence that he isn't tell the truth</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">3. Trump seizes on these media fact-checks as evidence that journalists are out to get him</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">4. His followers, uh, follow suit -- asking questions like: ""How many times has CNN lied since Trump became President?????""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Wash. Rinse. Repeat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The cumulative effect of this cycle -- after nearly four years of it -- is a steady erosion of truth or even the broader idea that we as humans have things on which we all can and should agree. What Trump has proven (or maybe re-proven when you look at the sweep of history) is that if someone in a position of power is willing to unblinkingly say things that aren't true, they can create a parallel universe of falsehoods that a not-insignificant number of people will believe. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The politicians who follow Trump into the presidency may not have the gall to push the lie line as far as he has. But none of them will come into office unaware of what he did to shape his own political reality.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

They are largely wrong. In many cases, foreign leaders and citizens of the world alike have likely ""priced in"" Trump's erratic behavior and sidelined his pronouncements. If so, the result is a neutered presidency and an America that is safer because Trump is often not taken seriously.  </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">For decades, Presidents have played critical roles in international affairs -- from Richard Nixon's détente with China to Ronald Reagan's force of will that toppled communism to Jimmy Carter's brokered peace between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. In these and countless other examples, past Presidents advanced American interests and inspired the world by wielding both formal constitutional powers, as well as the authority granted by foreign leaders who accepted their statements as US policy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">This isn't the case with Trump, whose words foreign leaders can no longer take at face value. Fortunately, President Trump's incompetence in foreign relations, while not a cure-all, can moderate the damage that he might otherwise cause. The more exposure the world has to this President, the less he matters. After all, communication is a two-way street, and the audience plays a significant role in determining whether someone's words are accurate, meaningful, and safe to rely on.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Take, for example, Trump's rhetoric on North Korea. While the President recently said he is <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/trump-not-bothered-by-north-korea-s-recent-missile-test-launches"" target=""_blank"">not bothered by new North Korean missile tests</a> -- conflicting with the view of intelligence agencies -- he previously threatened nuclear attack (in his own way of course, by <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/03/trump-north-korea-nuclear-button-tweet-himes-reax-bts-ac.cnn"" target=""_blank"">claiming that his button is bigger than Kim's</a>).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In any prior administration, words such as these from the American President would place us at the precipice of war. But as norm-busting as they may be, we have become conditioned to view them as just the latest in an unbroken string of overheated comments. His words aren't newsworthy because they will all have real world consequences but because in many instances they won't -- despite being uttered by the leader of the free world, they are heavily discounted by the world just the same.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, how should foreign nations react if Trump renews his threats to pull out of NATO, makes further statements that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit/index.html"" target=""_blank"">praise leaders of corrupt regimes</a>, such as Russia's Vladimir Putin, or makes some other jaw-dropping pronouncement? Unless these leaders haven't been paying attention, they should temper any initial alarm by weighing these statements against often-contradictory commentary from other senior American officials, the State Department and the CIA. His track record shows that impulsive words may not result in action. Ultimately, despite Trump's rhetoric, the US has not pulled out of NATO, and it has levied sanctions on Russia. Moreover, routine rebukes of Trump's comments from foreign leaders reveal an international band of adults who are ready to sideline the US President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, as oddly comforting as Trump's lack of global credibility may be, it reflects a sorry state of affairs. This administration has luckily not faced an acute national security crisis, such as a 9/11-style terrorist attack or an imminent threat of war. As has been the case throughout our history, when such circumstances arise, America needs a reliable and respected leader to guide the nation. And the way in which the President acts in moments such as these could determine the course of human history.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">President John F. Kennedy's approach to the Cuban missile crisis likely averted war. Conversely, President George W. Bush's fixation on weapons of mass destruction (which were never found) led to war with Iraq, resulting in the deaths of thousands of US service members and a power vacuum filled by al Qaeda, the group from which<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html"" target=""_blank""> ISIS</a> was later formed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If faced with a national security crisis, Trump's incompetence could pose serious problems. The void of US leadership could also damage the US' global standing and push fledgling nations, such as Libya, to take their cues from Russia and China rather than from the United States. And then there's Trump's command over the nuclear arsenal, which is scary, given his penchant for tantrums. In a crisis, it's hard to know where Trump's impulses would lead the nation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's more, there have been instances when President Trump's words have foretold real policy movements with real-world consequences, such as his use of tariffs as an international trade tool with China and his threats of tariffs on Mexican goods in an effort to advance immigration-related ends. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But recognizing that he can cause damage does not mean that every oddball comment he makes will have a lasting impact. We are, for the time being, stuck with Trump and, fortunately, his incompetence has helped moderate what could otherwise be calamitous by spurring foreign leaders to ignore him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What if foreign leaders are inclined to take him seriously and react as if his words had meaning? It is both my belief and continued hope that President Trump's journey to irrelevancy on the world stage advances by the tweet, continuing to take further root so that we will soon see the day when it will not only be reasonable for world leaders to ignore Trump but it will be the only rational thing for them to do.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the international stage, the one constant in modern history is that the American President is taken seriously. This is one norm that we should all be thankful Trump has broken. And hopefully, it is a norm that can be quickly restored once he is out of office.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""John Dean's been a loser for many years,"" Trump said on Monday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the hearing Dean, who was a key witness in the Watergate case, evoked similarities between that case and Mueller's investigation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In many ways the Mueller report is to President Trump what the so-called Watergate road map, officially titled the grand jury report ... was to President Richard Nixon,"" Dean said. ""Stated a little differently, special counsel Mueller has provided this committee with a road map.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hearing was the first in a series that the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are planning to hold to highlight the Mueller report publicly. Dean noted at the outset he was ""not a fact witness,"" but argued he could provide a historical perspective.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Democrats walked Dean and the former prosecutors through the excerpts of the Mueller report, reading passages aloud and asking the witnesses -- who argued Trump should have been charged with obstruction of justice -- to weigh in.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The facts contained in that report would be sufficient to prove all of the elements necessary to charge multiple counts of obstruction of justice,"" said Joyce White Vance, a former US attorney in Alabama. ""The evidence is not equivocal, nor is the charging decision a close call. And I would be willing to personally indict the case, and to try the case. I would have confidence that the evidence would be sufficient to obtain a guilty verdict and to win on appeal.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Republicans questioned why a key witness from the Nixon era was speaking to them about the Mueller report, seizing on his statement that he was not a fact witness and noting that his long public record of commentary criticizing the President.

The Justice Department responded it would also be willing to negotiate on the committee's document request so long as the House called off its contempt vote against Barr.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the Judiciary Committee still sees the resolution as part of the civil contempt process to enforce subpoenas through the courts, the Justice Department only considers it an effort to enforce subpoenas, and not contempt, according to a Justice Department official.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadler noted that Tuesday's vote included language authorizing court action against McGahn, in addition to Barr. He said that as long as the Justice Department ""proceeds in good faith,"" there would be no further steps taken against Barr, but added: ""If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, praised the agreement while suggesting the House should call off its floor vote on Tuesday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In light of today's agreement from the Justice Department, it's logical to ask: Is the chairman prepared to rescind his baseless recommendation to hold the attorney general in contempt, or do House Democrats still plan to green light lawsuits against the attorney general and former White House counsel tomorrow?""

But the other reason makes me wonder if Trump helped drive Baldwin from the role. Baldwin shared that ""all these people were attacking me,"" saying things like, ""Your impression sucks and you suck. Please go away."" The actor apparently had enough, explaining, ""I thought to myself: 'I really don't have a lot invested in my Trump impersonation, so please find someone and convince Lorne [Michaels] to replace me.' ""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This isn't a total surprise. Baldwin's reactions to Trump's attacks on Twitter over the years offer insight into whether Trump played a role in Baldwin's decision.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At first, Baldwin ignored Trump or responded playfully. For example, in December 2016, just a month before being sworn in, Trump <a href=""https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-saturday-night-live-tax-returns-1201933252/"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>, ""Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad."" In response, Baldwin<a href=""https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/donald-trump-alec-baldwin-saturday-night-live-tax-returns-1201933252/"" target=""_blank""> tweeted</a>, ""Release your tax returns and I'll stop. Ha""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In March 2018, Trump took his attacks to an<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/trump-alec-baldwin-snl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> even more personal level</a>, writing, ""Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch."" Then adding, ""Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent!"" Despite the anger of Trump's tweet, Baldwin again<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/02/politics/trump-alec-baldwin-snl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> responded with humor</a>, tweeting, ""Agony though it may be, I'd like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But, recently, Baldwin's responses turned much more serious, expressing concern that Trump was trying to inspire someone to attack him or his family. In February 2019, Trump took to Twitter<a href=""https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1097116612279316480"" target=""_blank""> calling for ""retribution""</a> against ""SNL"" for mocking him: ""Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution?""  Trump then <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1097117499336855553"" target=""_blank"">added a tweet</a> minutes later, ""THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As a reminder, this was just four months after self-professed Trump supporter Cesar Sayoc -- known as the ""MAGA bomber"" -- had <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/us/cesar-sayoc-guilty-plea/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sent explosive devices</a> to a variety of critics of Trump, from Hillary Clinton to CNN. Perhaps that (and Trump's tweets) <a href=""https://twitter.com/ABFalecbaldwin/status/1097319232151449600"" target=""_blank"">explain Baldwin's response</a>: ""I wonder if a sitting President exhorting his followers that my role in a TV comedy qualifies me as an enemy of the people constitutes a threat to my safety and that of my family?"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, just because Baldwin won't play Trump anymore does not mean that ""SNL"" will stop mocking the President. But has Trump succeeded in diminishing the visibility of the show by possibly driving out an award-winning actor who will be replaced by someone less known -- given that ""SNL"" is typically a platform for up-and-coming talent?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another apparent victory for Trump in his war on comedy involves the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) annual dinner, which for years featured a comedian who roasted the President. That is, until this year's dinner in April, when instead they <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-is-the-white-house-correspondents-association-doing-trumps-bidding"" target=""_blank"">featured historian Ron Chernow</a>. To many, it appeared the WHCA had yielded to Trump's demands after he took to Twitter to not only lash out at comedian Michelle Wolf,  who had mocked his administration at last year's dinner, but also called for the WHCA to change the dinner's format of featuring a comic: ""<a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/990782291667488768"" target=""_blank"">Put Dinner to rest, or start over!</a>"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To be clear, Trump's war on comedy predates his run for president. For example, in 2013, Trump<a href=""https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675"" target=""_blank""> sued Bill Maher</a> for $5 million for making a joke that Trump is ""the spawn of his mother having sex with an orangutan."" (He later withdrew the lawsuit.) And over the years, Trump has<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/17/opinions/trump-losing-war-on-comedy-obeidallah/index.html"" target=""_blank""> angrily lashed out</a> against comedians Jon Stewart and Seth Meyers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But never before has Trump appeared to have won even one skirmish in this war on comedy -- until now. We can debate the role Trump played in Baldwin ending his ""SNL"" run or the WHCA no longer featuring a comedian. But clearly these are developments Trump wanted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hope is that Trump never wins another battle in this war. Comedy has long been used in America to expose the faults of people in power, especially presidents.

Macron has in the past year been openly critical of Trump's increasingly ""America First"" mentality when it comes to issues ranging from the Iran nuclear deal to climate change. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a September 2018 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Macron railed against Trump's method saying ""dialogue and multilateralism"" were the more effective means of solving problems. Macron is not supportive of an isolationist approach to fix what ails the world's conflicts; similarly, the tree was apparently also not a fan of isolation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The tree itself was much more than any old oak tree, having come directly from the Belleau Wood in Northern France, where in 1918 during World War I, thousands of US Marines died during the three-week battle. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The blood (of Americans) was spilled to defend France,"" tweeted Macron last April after he and Trump participated in the ceremonial planting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, shortly thereafter, the five-to-10-year-old, approximately four-feet tall sapling was removed and placed under the care of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service at its facilities in Beltsville, Maryland, according to a USDA official at the time. The official had told CNN the quarantine was part of normal regulatory rules for imported trees and could last up to two years. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The service ""worked closely with French officials to facilitate the importation"" of the tree, the official had said, but quarantine was necessary because ""pathogens like the fungi phytophthora are not visible, like insects are, so it is not unusual for (the inspection service) to monitor imported plants for two years before determining they may be permanently placed."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the United States, confirmed to CNN the quarantine of the sapling, tweeting in April the roots were enclosed in a special plastic coating so as not to contaminate the White House soil.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""It's analogous to a buffet that has only 31 dishes; if they don't have what you want, they won't get your business,"" he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google told CNN Business that individual game publishers will announce more Stadia-compatible titles at the annual E3 video game conference, including new and highly anticipated releases. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Similar streaming services have failed in the past, Pachter wrote in an analyst note. Cloud gaming services like GameTap and OnLive did not taken off among gamers. OnLive was ultimately discontinued and GameTap was sold to a new company, where it still lives today. (GameTap was originally part of Turner Broadcasting, which is now WarnerMedia, CNN's parent company.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The problem is in how much companies can charge for a subscription service, according to Pachter. Charge $20 a month, and they can get better access to third-party content but gamers won't bite. Charge $10, and the offerings will be paltry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, there's hope for Google, analysts say. The company's free version of Stadia won't require people to buy a separate console and could be attractive. Pachter predicts that the storefront business model will be ""immensely successful."" ""Publishers would likely embrace this model and we see few impediments to its success,"" he wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google has invested a lot into Stadia. It launched its own Stadia Games and Entertainment studio to make Stadia games. A spokesperson said original content could be available starting next year.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Google also recently hired Jade Raymond, a Google VP who previously worked at Sony, Electronic Arts, and Ubisoft, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-raymond-121395/?originalSubdomain=ca"" target=""_blank"">according to her LinkedIn</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But its competitors are gearing up for a fight. Microsoft's upcoming xCloud game streaming service <a href=""https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/08/project-xcloud-gaming-with-you-at-the-center/"" target=""_blank"">is still being tested</a>, and it's possible the company will provide an update at E3.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Analysts anticipate Amazon potentially releasing its own streaming-game service by the end of the year. It would be different from the Amazon-owned Twitch, which lets people watch others play video games.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Laine Nooney, assistant professor and historian of video games at New York University, said that while Stadia has the advantage of being first to market with cloud streaming, Google still has to figure out who it's serving. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Does Google think it can pull players from Xbox, PlayStation, or Nintendo, companies that have defined what it means to be a gamer for 20 or 30 years? Or is Google hoping to...open up new player markets?"" said Nooney. ""It seems like Google is hoping to have it both ways.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

But unlike the 1990s boom — which included steady job creation, low inflation and a surging stock market — this latest expansion has been more like a prolonged, <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/news/economy/recession-anniversary/index.html"" target=""_blank"">gradual crawl</a>. It took years for America to emerge from its worst setback since the Great Depression.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The recovery has also been uneven. It started at different times in different parts of the country, lifting some people more than others. And now, questions are intensifying around <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/economy/us-recession-risk-nabe/index.html"" target=""_blank"">just how close America is to the end</a> of this business cycle, and what — if anything — could finally bring it to an end. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Let's take a look at the ten years since the economy bottomed out to see where things stand. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Employment is booming</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The share of Americans who want a job and can't find one, known as the unemployment rate, is one of the clearest indications that the US economy has returned to health. At <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/economy/jobs-report-may/index.html"" target=""_blank"">3.6% in May</a>, the rate has been hovering near 50-year lows. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm"" target=""_blank"">consumer sentiment </a>has reached historic highs. CNN polls also show that 7 in 10 Americans <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/cnn-poll-trump-prediction-economy-issues/index.html"" target=""_blank"">think the US economy is in ""good shape""</a> or better.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Part of the reason that unemployment is so low is that employers have more open positions than they can easily find workers to fill them. The job openings rate, which measures job listings as a percentage of the total number employed, zoomed past the hiring rate in 2015. There have been <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/unemp-per-job-opening.htm"" target=""_blank"">more job openings than workers</a> to fill them since early 2018, meaning that there's theoretically a job for everyone — if they're in the right places, with the right qualifications. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That doesn't mean that everyone has as much work as they want, however. A <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE"" target=""_blank"">broader measure of underemployment</a>, which also captures discouraged workers and those who want to work more hours, was slower to sink and still hasn't reached its lowest point on record, in 2000. Also, the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060"" target=""_blank"">labor force participation rate</a> for people in their prime working years — which measures the share of the population who either have jobs or are looking for one — remains a full percentage point below its pre-recession high and two points below the all-time high in 1999.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The tightening labor market also took a long time to translate into higher wages, with average hourly earnings growth topping 3% in 2018, not counting inflation. Many employers have added non-wage benefits like better health care and help repaying student loans, but those total<a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECIALLCIV"" target=""_blank""> compensation costs</a> still haven't topped the 3.5% year-over-year growth rates reached before the recession. Also, those gains have<a href=""https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx"" target=""_blank""> flowed disproportionately</a> to people switching jobs — workers who stay with one employer for long periods of time still aren't always getting regular raises. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why have wages been slow to recover? Economists generally chalk it up to the decline of labor unions, slow <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/economy/productivity-recovery/index.html"" target=""_blank"">productivity growth</a>, automation that allows employers to replace workers if they get too expensive, and a continued influx of workers from the sidelines who may not have been able to afford to hold a job because childcare or transportation costs exceeded their wages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But economists argue that the longer unemployment remains very low, <a href=""https://www.cbpp.org/research/full-employment/the-increasing-benefits-and-diminished-costs-of-running-a-high-pressure"" target=""_blank"">the more ground</a> workers are <a href=""https://www.epi.org/blog/evidence-that-tight-labor-markets-really-will-increase-labors-share-of-income-economic-policy-institute-macroeconomics-newsletter/"" target=""_blank"">likely to regain</a> — especially those that employers have historically overlooked, like people of color, the disabled and the formerly incarcerated. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Markets roared back, but not everyone has benefited</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Most American businesses — or at least, those that survived the recession — didn't take long to return to profitability. As a percentage of GDP, after-tax profits have been <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mmnQ"" target=""_blank"">significantly higher</a> than they were during previous decades, as the<a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173"" target=""_blank""> share of corporate income</a> going to labor has declined.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The stock market started rebounding almost immediately and has hit record after record, driven in part by loose monetary policy that propped up asset values. Even after a couple of stumbles brought on by instability in China and a confluence of factors at the end of 2018, the S&amp;P 500 has still more than quadrupled in value since bottoming out in February 2009. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That sustained bull market didn't help everyone, however. Only 54% of Americans say they own stocks either directly or through a 401(k), according to a <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/211052/stock-ownership-down-among-older-higher-income.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&amp;g_medium=TOPIC&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=U.S.%2520Stock%2520Ownership%2520Down%2520Among%2520All%2520but%2520Older%2c%2520Higher-Income"" target=""_blank"">Gallup poll in 2017</a>, down from 65% in 2007. Wealthier people were able to buy low during the downturn and benefit from ten years of gains, while poorer people had to get by on their wages, contributing to the continued rise in wealth inequality in the post-recession period. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Housing prices recovered as well, but more so in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York, even <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/news/economy/colorado-housing-prices/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Denver</a> and Portland. Those are also the cities where zoning restrictions have kept a lid on housing supply, sending prices soaring as high-paying tech employers flocked to previously-abandoned city centers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In those places, high housing prices are bad news for renters, who have faced much <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=o6Mi"" target=""_blank"">steeper increases in the cost of shelter</a> as a result of the years-long drought in non-luxury apartment construction that developers are <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/affordable-housing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">still trying to build their way out of</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In other places, housing values remain depressed. Smaller cities in the industrial Midwest were hit hard by the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP"" target=""_blank"">drop-off in manufacturing employment</a> during the recession. Even after tens of thousands of vacant properties were demolished and the foreclosure rate virtually disappeared, homes are still worth far less than they were in sections of Detroit, Cleveland and Erie — which has a <a href=""https://www.epi.org/blog/ohios-economy-no-longer-fully-recovers-after-recessions/"" target=""_blank"">lingering impact</a> on residents' financial well-being. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Warning signs are on the horizon</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For both consumers and businesses, memories of widespread defaults and bankruptcies have faded fast, and we are living in a new era of debt. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cheap capital has prompted companies to take nearly as much leverage as ever as a percentage of the economy. Much of it has gone into <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/is-there-too-much-business-debt.html"" target=""_blank"">share buybacks and acquisitions</a>, propelling a movement towards consolidation that some argue has <a href=""https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy"" target=""_blank"">retarded business dynamism and stifled innovation</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although total mortgage debt has subsided — in part because so many people lost their homes through foreclosure after the financial crisis — Americans have racked up more credit card debt than ever and student debt has <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FGCCSAQ027S"" target=""_blank"">multiplied nearly sevenfold</a> since the end of the recession, as people took refuge from a bad job market by going back to school. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">More important than the raw amount of debt, however, is the difficulty consumers are having when they try to pay it back. Here, student debt is <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/us/student-loan-debt-stories-trnd/index.html"" target=""_blank"">proving to be the biggest problem</a>: Delinquency rates for student loans have surpassed those for home loans, since the jobs graduates got weren't always well-paid enough to keep up with rent, grocery and loan payments at the same time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike mortgages, student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy. And there's mounting evidence that those heavy debt burdens have kept young people in particular from purchasing their first homes, although the overall <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N"" target=""_blank"">homeownership rate</a> has rebounded to its historic average. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Finally, government borrowing has also ballooned as a percentage of GDP over the last decade. It started during the Great Recession, when the government passed several stimulus measures to resuscitate the economy. The national debt should have subsided as tax revenues recovered, but <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/politics/federal-deficits-gop/index.html"" target=""_blank"">massive tax cuts in 2017</a> <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/economy/22-trillion-debt/index.html"" target=""_blank"">only added more red ink</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">All that debt is only sustainable if interest rates remain as low as they have been on account of the Federal Reserve's prolonged strategy of buying US Treasuries in order to stimulate the economy. But an interest rate shock would swamp many deeply indebted companies in short order. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's why it's important to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/13/news/economy/financial-crisis-10-years-later-lehman/index.html"" target=""_blank"">think about the risks</a> — which at the moment center mostly around international trade. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The United States' negative trade balance with other countries isn't necessarily a problem in itself, since American consumers benefit from products made more cheaply in other countries, and American businesses often locate their more knowledge-intensive jobs on their home turf. But it has proven a political hot potato, as President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened tariffs countries he says are ""taking advantage"" of the United States. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Whether or not he's right, the escalating trade war <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/economy/us-recession-risk-nabe/index.html"" target=""_blank"">tops the list of concerns</a> for growth going forward for members of the National Association for Business Economics, whose most recent survey showed that 56% of its members saw trade tensions as the biggest downside risk for the economy in 2019. That doesn't necessarily mean tariffs will tank the recovery — but of course, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act"" target=""_blank"">it's happened before</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>When will the expansion end?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although it's an imperfect measure, the single broadest measure of economic growth is gross domestic product, and by that metric, the US has been performing fairly consistently since 2014. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The economy has had only a handful of negative quarters since 2009, after four of them in a row. What's more, the US growth rate has remained significantly above those of most other developed countries, due in part to an oil and gas boom that has boosted exports and helped revive manufacturing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even that is dropping off, with most economists projecting growth on the order of 2% in 2019, down from almost 3% in 2018, and declining thereafter. In that scenario, the best the United States can hope for is that a slow march towards economic health just gets a bit slower, rather than erasing a decade of painful progress.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the US does end up in another recession, it may not be immediately obvious. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which <a href=""https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html"" target=""_blank"">officially dates the beginnings and ends of business cycles</a>, took 15 months to declare that the turning point had occurred in June 2009. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fortunately for America, research has found that long and deep recessions lead to more durable recoveries — not the other way around. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

A version of this story was published in The Conversation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad Paragraph__isDropCap"">For nearly a century, a massive mural by painter Victor Arnautoff titled ""The Life of Washington"" has lined the hallways of San Francisco's George Washington High School.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It may not be there much longer.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Washington High School's Reflection and Action Working Group -- an ad-hoc committee made up students, school employees and local artists, historians and Native Americans -- believes the mural ""glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, manifest destiny, white supremacy (and) oppression,"" according to a statement <a href=""https://thefrisc.com/at-sfs-washington-high-an-83-year-old-mural-depicting-slaves-and-a-dead-native-american-is-again-b2b576bdf5da"" target=""_blank"">published</a> in local media.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The group reportedly identified two panels as especially offensive. One shows Washington pointing westward next to the body of a dead Native American (pictured above). The other depicts slaves working in the fields of Mount Vernon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Because the work ""traumatizes students and community members,"" the group's statement concluded that ""the impact of this mural is greater than its intent ever was."" They are campaigning for its removal.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The idea that impact matters more than intention has informed debates about everything from microaggressions to cultural appropriation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But when it comes to art, should impact matter more than intention?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As historians committed to preserving our cultural heritage -- and as citizens invested in the power of art to engage the public -- we see the growing chorus of voices favoring impact over intention as a dangerous trend, one that makes art more vulnerable to rejection, censorship or even destruction.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>A radical work for its time</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">For most members of the Washington High School's Reflection and Action Group, the only message ""The Life of Washington"" sends is one of crushing, dehumanizing oppression.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">What happens, though, when we examine the mural in the context of the life and times of the artist?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Painter Victor Arnautoff was born in 1896 in a small village in present-day Ukraine. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1925, where he joined a leftist art collective. During the Great Depression he was a supporter of workers' strikes and formally joined the Communist Party in 1937. He was even hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 for drawing a ""Communist Conspiracy"" cartoon that caricatured then-Vice President Nixon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In ""The Life of Washington,"" Arnautoff decided to place Native Americans, African Americans and working-class revolutionaries front and center in the four largest panels, relegating Washington to the margins.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The slaves toiling in the Mount Vernon fields highlight a central paradox of America's history: The nation was founded by men who championed liberty, freedom and equality, and yet owned slaves.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Then there's the striking image of the fallen Native American. The mural's detractors say that it dismisses the humanity of indigenous peoples. But why must it necessarily be read as dehumanizing to Native Americans? Could it not instead be seen as throwing into sharp relief the inhumanity of the founding fathers?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In his biography of Arnautoff, Robert W. Cherny, wrote that the image challenged the fallacy that ""westward expansion had been into largely vacant territory waiting for white pioneers to develop its full potential.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">There's a <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/san-francisco-high-school-may-destroy-historical-murals"" target=""_blank"">strong case</a> to be made that Arnautoff is exposing -- rather than celebrating -- slavery and genocide. As Native American Tamaka Bailey, of the Choctaw Nation, <a href=""https://twitter.com/tamaka3715/status/1127996787283775489"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: the murals ""do not glorify slavery but prove that (Washington) was a slave-owner"" and ""part of the Genocide of First Nation Peoples."" Moreover, those arguing for the mural's removal are overlooking the fact that African Americans are not only portrayed as picking cotton and that Native Americans are not only depicted as victims. Rather Arnautoff is insisting that African Americans and indigenous peoples were key historical actors in the making of the United States.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">That the mural appears in a school is particularly important. For decades, the country's educational institutions perpetuated national myths about American exceptionalism and American history as one long glorious march of forward progress. Up until the 1960s, the standard US history curriculum ignored the country's dark and terrifying history of racial violence, including enslavement and the slaughter of indigenous peoples. So drawing attention to the horrors inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans would have been a radical statement in 1930s America.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Many of those in favor of scrapping the murals seem to believe that merely depicting past atrocities justifies them. In fact, the Action and Reflection Working Group concluded that the mural contravened the San Francisco Unified School District's commitment to ""social justice.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Quite to the contrary. In our view, the ""Life of Washington"" is an invaluable resource for students to engage in a serious and sustained way with social justice issues. It provides a singular opportunity to cultivate historical literacy and to equip students with the skills to analyze and discuss difficult material. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">From new student orientation to classes in art, history and civics, this mural should be formally incorporated into the George Washington High School curriculum. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>Only the latest controversy</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The controversy over this mural is sadly not an isolated exception.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Over the past several years, there have been dozens of cases where plays, poems, books, prints, paintings, sculptures, installations and other creative works have been shut down, canceled, removed or otherwise censored based on snap judgments, social media swarms, ideologically motivated reasoning and obtuse interpretations of the art in question.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In all of these cases, there has been little to no regard for the aspirations, aims and ambitions of the artists themselves. Their intentions have been treated along a spectrum that runs from indifference to contempt.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">To be clear, we are not saying that an artist's intent is all that matters. How people interpret and respond to a work of art is inseparable from its raison d'etre.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But disregarding the intentions of artists would place every significant creative work with a whiff of controversy in jeopardy because of its ""problematic"" or ""offensive"" content. In a world where intentionality and context are irrelevant, satire and irony would not only be incomprehensible but forbidden.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Mark Twain's frequent invocation of the n-word in ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""? Just a vicious rehearsal of a profoundly damaging racial slur. Artist Kara Walker's searing paper cuts depicting the horrific violence of slavery in the United States? Nothing more than a celebration of the white domination of black bodies. Keegan-Michael Key's brilliant sketch character Luther who serves as Obama's ""anger translator""? Simply a racist caricature of the ""angry black man.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>What else becomes vulnerable to censorship?</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Calls to censor ""offensive"" art by committees, petitions or the Twitterverse are especially dangerous. For every case of ""righteous"" censorship that removes works of art that are allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic and so on, there will be scores more censored on the grounds that they are anti-American or offensive to Christians.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As the American Library Association <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/blog/whose-books-are-banned"" target=""_blank"">reports</a>, the most frequently challenged and banned books are those that contain ""diverse content"" and include characters of color or address themes of sexuality, racism, religion, disability and mental illness. Four out of the top 11 most <a href=""http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10"" target=""_blank"">challenged or banned books</a> in 2018 were objected to on the basis of their LGBT content. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""Two Boys Kissing"" -- a 2013 novel centered around the lives of seven gay teenagers -- has made the American Library Association list for several years running, even though The Guardian <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/16/review-david-levithan-two-boys-kissing"" target=""_blank"">described</a> it as a ""complex,"" ""intricate"" novel ""so extremely powerful (it) leaves you thinking long, long after you have finished reading it.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Thinking long and hard, alas, is in short supply for members of the ""we are not interested in the artist's intentions"" brigade, to quote a recent <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/mr-president-of-the-french-national-assembly-ladies-and-gentlemen-honorable-members-of-the-national-assembly-say-no-to-racism-on-the-walls-of-the-french-national-assembly"" target=""_blank"">petition</a> calling for the removal of a large fresco, also deemed racist, at France's National Assembly. Ripping art from its context degrades our critical faculties and imprisons us in the present. It smacks of a literal-minded authoritarianism that assumes and indeed insists that a creative work can and must only be read in one way.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">When people refuse to see the contradictions, tensions and ambiguities of art, it becomes disposable. Arnautoff's detractors bring to mind Oscar Wilde's warning that any time a spectator of art tries to ""exercise authority over it and the artist,"" he ""becomes the avowed enemy of Art and of himself.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It took Arnautoff almost a year to complete the mural, painstaking labor that could be erased with a single coat of paint. Not only would this outcome whitewash history, it would also deal a severe blow to our own capacity for creativity and critical thought.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><em>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) told CNN that the school's superintendent and staff are currently reviewing the Reflection and Action Working Group's request, and a decision has yet to be made regarding the mural's future. </em></div>]"

In fairness, he appears to be doing a sub-par job without them. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I have mixed feelings about heels at work. A decent metal spike under your feet can feel powerful, almost warrior-like. As a relatively short person (I'm 5 feet, 3 inches tall), I can testify that heels can be a genuine asset when trying to assert authority. They're often the difference between looking up at a boss who already infantilizes you or looking them in the eye. I've been called a ""girl"" by bosses for years who never referred to my male colleagues of the same age as ""boys,"" and I'm certain this was in part because I am physically small. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But wearing heels is also fraught with complicating factors. They mildly incapacitate you. They make you swing your hips and walk more slowly and can play into<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/08/mad-mens-very-modern-sexism-problem/60788/"" target=""_blank""> irritating Mad Men-esque stereotypes</a> of being a woman in an office, or Sex and the City tropes of sinking whole paychecks into the cost of designer shoes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Tall women who are obliged to wear heels at the office tower over everyone, which is cool, but not necessarily every wearer's first choice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Too often, how to dress becomes a toss-up between being taken seriously as an adult woman or objectified as one. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The professional histories of my friends, acquaintances and people who responded when I asked about this on social media are rich with stories of heel-related woe. Many of these were purely physical. Several who had worked as waitresses in recent years recalled that compulsory heels made the manual work significantly harder -- in one instance, to the point that an ice bucket was provided for the female staff to soak their feet in after the shift. She was quick to point out that this was an inclusive bucket -- ""men were allowed to use it too!"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Compromises aren't only health-related. A friend told me that when she worked as an agency waitress, to take the (better-paid) option of hostess shifts, women had to wear high heels -- which weren't provided by the company -- for the 12-hour shifts. She declined.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The implications for spending a lot of time on your feet in heels are serious. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36265545"" target=""_blank"">It takes an average</a> of one hour, six minutes, and 48 seconds for feet in high heels to start hurting feet and legs. They can cause bunions, back problems, ankle sprains and tight calves. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The University of Alabama at Birmingham has<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977152"" target=""_blank""> published research</a> showing that high heel-related injuries in the US had doubled over the preceding decade, with emergency rooms treating 123,355 people for them. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Despite the obvious physical risks involved,<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36265545"" target=""_blank""> laws vary widely</a> when it comes to employee dress codes. In 2017, the Canadian province of British Columbia<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/08/canadian-province-makes-it-illegal-to-require-women-to-wear-high-heels"" target=""_blank""> amended the workplace act</a> to make it illegal for employers to require women to wear heels, calling them a threat to employee health and safety. But the situation in many places is far less clear-cut.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this year, Norwegian Air drew heavy criticism for requiring female cabin crew to carry a doctor's note if they wanted to wear flat shoes. A <a href=""https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/129823"" target=""_blank"">2016 petition</a> to change British law was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39667912"" target=""_blank"">rejected</a>, despite employers frequently discriminating against women. And in the US, where<a href=""https://equitablegrowth.org/gender-segregation-at-work-separate-but-equal-or-inequitable-and-inefficient/"" target=""_blank""> ""separate but equal""</a> remains the prevailing norm, much tends to depend on the<a href=""https://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/research-topics/office-hr/instituting-a-dress-code-thats-legal-and-appropriate-for-your-workplace"" target=""_blank""> individual policy</a> of the employer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even when there is no dress code, there is an unofficial assumption that women will wear them in many jobs. A former legal secretary in London told me that when she didn't wear heels, her boss would complain behind her back that she looked ""frumpy"" and ""dressed like an old woman."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The conflicting associations we have with heels, that they are smart, sexy, superficial, femme, or powerful, have all been projected onto them by people. Unless you're in a working environment where heels impede your performance, or are stupidly risky, the choice between heels or no heels should be up to the wearer, whatever their gender. If anyone takes issue with or makes assumptions based on that, that's not the shoe-wearer's problem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For my welcome lunch during the first week of a new job several years ago, I wore a smart skirt, heels and some makeup. I figured it was a superficial demonstration of effort-making which might be appreciated early on.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As my new, male boss sat down to this lunch attended by myself and 10 other men, he remarked: ""Well Holly, you can bring a little glamor to this bunch!"" It was well-meant, but for me at least, it set a weird, mildly archaic tone. It felt like my effort to be taken seriously had been interpreted as frivolous. My boss didn't highlight any of my professional experience, or comment on anything else I might have to offer, during that lunch. I don't wear heels for anyone besides myself, now.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Biden will spend his day campaigning in eastern Iowa, according to his schedule, while Trump will head for the western side to make remarks on renewable energy before flying to central Des Moines for a dinner and fundraiser with the state's Republican Party. White House officials insisted the twin visits to the state were not planned, but campaign aides said they found the optics humorous. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though they won't come face-to-face, the feud that has bubbled up between Trump and Biden will loom over their visits. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's allies were delighted in recent days as the Biden campaign dealt with several missteps. Biden was hit with blistering criticism from his 2020 rivals over his position on an <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/joe-biden-hyde-amendment-reversal/index.html"" target=""_blank"">amendment regarding abortion rights, before reversing days later</a>.

And he skipped the largest gathering of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates to date while attending his granddaughter's graduation, a move that did not go unnoticed by his competitors. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Biden will be in Iowa on Tuesday when Trump comes to town -- setting him up for the visual he has desired from the start: a direct competitor to the President. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We didn't know Joe Biden was back from his hiatus,"" Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, told CNN in a statement. ""Has Alyssa Milano been consulted?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The actress and women's rights activist has been a Biden supporter and reportedly urged him to reverse his stance on the abortion rights amendment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Despite Biden's stumbles, those close to the President say Biden has occupied his head space more than any other candidate in the Democratic field, because Trump fears Biden poses a more serious threat to the blue-collar appeal that helped him win the 2016 election. Trump has continued to regularly phone aides and allies in the early morning hours to quiz them about Biden -- and ask whether he poses a threat to his staying power in the White House. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump lashed out in recent weeks after an internal campaign poll showed him lagging behind Biden in states that will be crucial to his re-election victory, such as Michigan, and even told some he doubted the numbers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Iowa as ground zero</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For Trump, Iowa is among the collection of prized states that he turned from blue to red during his race for the White House. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/states/iowa"" target=""_blank"">He carried Iowa's six electoral votes, defeating Hillary Clinton 52% to 42%</a>, a staggering turnaround after Barack Obama twice won the state. In Iowa, 32 counties flipped between the last two presidential elections, where voters chose Obama in 2012 and Trump in 2016. It was more than any other state in the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's visit on Tuesday serves as something of counter-programming for a state crowded with Democratic presidential candidates -- nearly two dozen of whom have been campaigning for the Iowa caucuses early next year. Trump, who has complained that Democrats are being treated more fairly by the press than he was, is intent on keeping the state in the Republican column in 2020. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who served in the Obama administration as agriculture secretary, said Democrats underestimated Trump at their own peril. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think it would be foolish for anyone to assume that a sitting president is easily defeated,"" Vilsack told CNN. ""I think we need to understand this is going to be a very, very difficult fight.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Barely a day goes by where one Democratic presidential candidate -- or several -- aren't visiting the state at any given time. Trump has become a frequent punch line, but Democratic leaders here have warned their supporters against thinking the President will be easy to unseat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You just can't bash him,"" said J.D.

He has attacked Biden from the South Lawn of the White House, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/politics/trump-japan-election-2020/index.html"" target=""_blank"">while standing next to the Japanese prime minister during a news conference in Tokyo</a> and often from his favorite platform, Twitter. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Biden, who is hoping to set himself apart from the fray of the expansive 2020 field, has happily returned the fire. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While in Davenport, Iowa, Tuesday, Biden will go after Trump by name dozens of times while labeling him ""an existential threat to America."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In 2020, we not only have to repudiate Donald Trump's policies and values -- we have to clearly and firmly reject his view of the Presidency,"" Biden will say, according to prepared remarks released by his campaign.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As the President grows more consumed with cable news coverage of his potential election foes, his campaign has focused on ways to distract from Democrats during their upcoming campaign rallies and election debates, aides told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the President's re-election effort has noted he's not the only candidate on the ticket in 2020. His fundraiser Tuesday will benefit the Iowa Republican Party, not his campaign, an aide said. Tickets for the dinner started at $250 for general admission, with higher prices for a dinner with the president. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump spent a significant amount of time in Iowa during the 2016 presidential campaign. After he famously descended the Trump Tower escalator and declared he was running for president nearly four years ago, Trump boarded his 757 jet and headed straight for Des Moines, where he gave a wide-ranging speech and attendees received free ""TRUMP: Make America Great Again"" t-shirts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He ultimately lost the Iowa caucuses to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump but affirmed his support in the state when he beat Clinton in the general election. But two House seats in Iowa flipped from Republican to Democrat in the 2018 midterm elections, a sign of the state's continuing shifting demographics. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Sarah Westwood contributed to this report.</p>]"

Instead, even the most centrist contenders -- including front-runner Joe Biden -- are betting that Trump's norm-shattering presidency has demonstrated that voters are receptive to big change, even if that means pitched political battles in Washington.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The truth of it is Trump has shown ... that there's a strong appetite for bold solutions to significant problems,"" says Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a leading liberal<strong><em> </em></strong>think tank. ""Trump's disruption, and many of his lunatic ideas, have widened the aperture of what's acceptable in the policy debates.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In just the past week, Biden put out a $1.7 trillion plan to combat climate change, Sen. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/politics/elizabeth-warren-economic-patriotism-green-new-deal-midwest/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts issued a $2 trillion proposal to promote a green economy</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/us/politics/booker-renters-credit.html"" target=""_blank"">Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey issued an affordable housing plan</a> that could cost over $130 billion annually and former Texas Rep. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/beto-orourke-voting-rights-plan-term-limits-campaign-finance/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Beto O'Rourke released a  blueprint to overhaul the political system</a> that included a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress and the Supreme Court. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At various points earlier in the race, candidates have proposed a massive federal investment in raising teacher salaries, mandatory federal approval of state abortion laws, allowing felons to vote while still incarcerated, ending the Electoral College, big tax cuts for middle- and lower-middle-income families, forgiving virtually all student debt, federally funded ""baby bonds"" targeted especially at low-income children, establishing universal pre-K and tuition-free public college, creating a statutory federal right to abortion, legalizing 11 million undocumented immigrants, renewing the ban on assault weapons and, of course, replacing private health insurance with a government-funded single-payer health care system. Even the more centrist alternative on health care -- allowing all Americans to buy into Medicare -- would constitute a huge expansion in government's involvement in the medical system.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The eventual nominee isn't likely to endorse all of these ideas. But that list testifies to the rise in Democratic ambitions -- and expectations. Cumulatively, the 2020 agenda rivals or even exceeds the magnitude of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society during the 1960s. It far exceeds the legislative ambitions of Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the last two Democratic presidents.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In many ways, the scale of the 2020 Democratic proposals reflects a consensus across ideological lines in the party about one reason for Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016. Though Clinton also offered a wide array of plans to address many issues, hardly any were large or compelling enough to capture the public's imagination. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That led many Democratic strategists to conclude that she failed to provide voters a pithy answer to what is sometimes called the Ted Kennedy question: Why are you running for president? (<a href=""https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2010/03/11/what-ted-said/"" target=""_blank"">Kennedy memorably flunked that question with a stumbling answer</a> in an interview with CBS' Roger Mudd when he announced his primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This time, Democrats have almost universally concluded that big ideas signal to voters a big commitment to improve their lives.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Incremental solutions communicate that the problem is not so large,"" Tanden says. ""That is what Trump championed. If you think the problem is big you have a bold solution to it. I think that makes sense to people.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Large plans -- and huge plans</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Significant differences in scale remain within the Democratic field. Warren, with her ""I've got a plan for that"" mantra, has set the pace for comprehensive proposals; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, while he has added relatively fewer new plans this time, isn't far behind her with the big agenda he identified in 2016, led by a single-payer health care system and free tuition at public colleges and universities. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the other end, Biden and several candidates trailing in the polls -- Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado, as well as former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper -- have generally offered more restrained promises. Yet, as Biden's climate change plan demonstrated, even the most restrained candidates are offering no shortage of changes that would have been considered the vanguard of political plausibility in earlier cycles.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I do think there's a bit of an arms race underway,"" says Matt Bennett, an executive vice president at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This commitment to scale creates several obvious risks. One is that the cumulative cost of the Democrats' ideas will provide tempting targets for Republicans poised to portray them as ""tax and spend"" liberals or even ""socialists"" in the general election. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They are trying to appeal to specific groups with these specific policies (but) when they make all these promises they run the risk of frightening taxpayers,"" says Glen Bolger, a partner in the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Republican pollsters (and, privately, even some Democrats) report that in focus groups voters are already expressing skepticism that all of the ideas the Democratic field is proposing, such as universal pre-K and expanded access to higher education, can be funded just by raising taxes on the wealthy, without touching the middle class.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Swing voters understand 'free is not free' as a powerful way to capture the Democrat agenda,"" <a href=""https://pos.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Republicans-and-the-2020-Election-June-2019.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Public Opinion Strategies argued in a memo on public opinion</a> that it released last week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yet many Democrats believe they will be shielded from those Republican arguments by the huge cost of the Trump tax cut: <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/publication/53787"" target=""_blank"">Its nearly $2 trillion price tag over the next decade</a> means they can claim to fund big components of their agenda by retrenching it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""One thing they have that Clinton didn't is the Trump tax cuts,"" Bennett says. ""That is different, and that is a big pot of money they can spend."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The other big question posed by the scale of the Democratic agenda is how the candidates propose to move these ideas into law at a time when the country is so closely split between the major parties. Even if Democrats hold the House and win the White House next year, they are highly unlikely to achieve more than a very narrow Senate majority, under the most optimistic projections. That means even if they capture the majority, most of these ambitious Democratic ideas still would be subject to Republican filibusters.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Only a handful of Democratic candidates, particularly Warren and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, have committed to trying to eliminate the filibuster if they win the White House. (Trump has also called for eliminating it). Several of the senators in the race, including Sanders and Booker, have defended the filibuster, arguing that its termination would expose Democrats to unacceptable risks when they fall into the minority. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Besides, any Democratic Senate majority in 2021 would require at least some gains for the party in states that are closely divided between the parties or even lean toward the GOP, such as Alabama, Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia. That means it's not guaranteed that even if Democrats eliminated the filibuster they would be assured of holding enough of their own caucus to amass a majority vote for their most ambitious ideas.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moreover, it remains unclear that the public is as receptive as Democrats hope to the notion of providing Washington with sweeping new authority across a range of issues. While the share of Americans who say they would prefer a ""bigger government with more services"" has increased over the past several years in <a href=""https://www.people-press.org/2019/04/11/little-public-support-for-reductions-in-federal-spending/pp_2019-04-11_federal-spending_0-03-2/"" target=""_blank"">polling by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center</a>, that number reached only 47% in the latest survey -- just as many Americans said they prefer ""a smaller government with fewer services.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Can pragmatism win in 2020?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The debate over the viability of the most ambitious Democratic ideas is on track to unfold very differently this time than it did in the 2016 primaries. In that race, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/bernie-sanders-2020-pushback-democratic-rivals/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Clinton only rarely challenged the substance of Sanders' sweeping ideas</a>. Rather, she mostly argued that plans such as his single-payer health care system were unlikely to pass a closely divided Congress. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In effect, she ceded the field of inspirational change to Sanders and presented her own ideas not as superior, but merely as more pragmatic. That left her in the position of seeming to rain on the party's excitement with dour, if accurate, warnings about the unlikelihood of Sanders' agenda ever clearing a closely divided Congress.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even the most centrist Democrats seem conscious today of avoiding that trap. Given the fervor among the party's activist base for a strong response to Trump, Bennett says he thinks ""there's a real danger"" for any Democratic contender to make the Clinton argument that the field's most ambitious ideas are unlikely to pass.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From a different point on the party's ideological spectrum, Tanden agrees. ""There is a question of level and scope,"" she says. ""But ... I don't know that it is going to be successful, in a Democratic primary, to criticize Sen. Warren for doing so much, and I don't even know it's going to be effective in a general election.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One candidate who appears to have taken the Clinton precedent to heart is the front-runner, Biden. The former vice president generally hasn't embraced the field's most liberal positions. For instance, he's rejected a government takeover of the health care system and proposed instead to allow more Americans to buy into Medicare. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://joebiden.com/climate/"" target=""_blank"">Biden's climate plan</a>, though proposing a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, maintains a possible role for nuclear power and capturing the carbon from coal-generated electricity, ideas anathema to the most liberal environmentalists. Biden's aides say flatly that he won't be tempted into a ""bidding war"" with opponents who are constantly promising to spend more, or extend federal regulations further, on problems Democrats care about, from combating climate change to easing economic inequality.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But unlike Clinton, Biden is not centering his case against those ideas on the claim that they can't pass Congress; he's arguing instead that they are the wrong policy. On health care, for instance, he argues that shifting to a government-run system would be too disruptive to the roughly 180 million Americans with health insurance. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We are developing a very bold, very progressive agenda that he thinks is the right way to go,"" said one Biden adviser, who asked for anonymity to discuss internal campaign deliberations. ""He's not telling you, 'Guys, I've seen Washington. You're never going to get that done.' It's not, 'That would be great if only we could do it.' He's going to argue that his ideas are the right way forward.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, when the Democratic presidential debates begin later this month in Miami, many of the rivals surrounding Biden onstage will be promising more sweeping and expensive programs on a wide array of issues. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/2020-democrats-california-progressives-joe-biden/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Sanders hinted at the arguments they will raise</a> in his recent appearance at the California Democratic convention, when he repeatedly declared there could be ""no middle ground"" on issues from climate to abortion. ""We cannot go back to the old ways,"" Sanders insisted, ""we have got to go forward with a new and progressive agenda."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the same event, Warren declared: ""The time for small ideas is over.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Neither candidate mentioned Biden's name, but there was little doubt that their language referred to him. From the many candidates to Biden's left, those arguments are virtually certain to grow more pointed at the first debate, and at the CNN debate that follows in July. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biden may be determined to avoid a bidding war in his policy promises, but like all battle plans, it's an open question whether that strategy can survive first contact with the enemy.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

They told Biden that his old position was untenable in a Democratic party that it is alarmed by draconian anti-abortion laws being adopted in various states such as Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana, and by the many anti-choice judges President Trump has appointed to the federal courts.           </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ironically, it is President Trump's own flip-flopping that may have helped make it possible for Biden to backtrack without necessarily suffering the consequences at the polls. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump was long in favor of abortion rights but became the darling of anti-abortion Christian right activists when he <a href=""https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/01/25/why-donald-trump-has-become-a-pro-life-crusader"" target=""_blank"">embraced their position</a>.

They have likewise ignored all the evidence of his moral corruption, including his demeaning <a href=""https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-every-offensive-comment-in-one-place/"" target=""_blank"">statements about women</a>, and the scandals that have caused <a href=""https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/"" target=""_blank"">turnover and turmoil</a> in his government. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's backtracking, divisiveness and scandals, combined with the forgiveness he receives from his loyal base, suggest that he has broken our politics in a fundamental way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Consistency and decency may no longer be required of political leaders. In fact, in this era of hyperpartisanship and personality-driven campaigns, some people seem to double down on their loyalty when their candidate says or does something others find objectionable. The President indulges in childish name-calling and it's just Trump being Trump. Biden <a href=""https://www.prweek.com/article/1581986/biden-botched-touchy-feely-crisis-response"" target=""_blank"">botched his response</a> to concerns about his touchy-feely habits and <a href=""https://www.dailywire.com/news/45500/lindsey-graham-susan-collins-defend-biden-just-paul-bois"" target=""_blank"">even some Republicans</a> said everyone should cut him some slack.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biden's record includes many controversies, but they don't seem to be slowing him down. As <a href=""https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/27/18262482/joe-biden-anita-hill-2020-christine-blasey-ford-brett-kavanaugh"" target=""_blank"">chairman of the Senate committee</a>, he let his colleagues abuse Anita Hill as she testified about Thomas's alleged sexual harassment and failed to let other women who would have supported her claims testify. He was an <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/16/joe-bidens-defense-crime-bills-role-incarceration-trend/?utm_term=.c14fcf0f9ce4"" target=""_blank"">outspoken supporter of the 1994 crime bill</a>, which many Democrats -- and some Republicans -- have criticized for its role in the mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders in black and brown communities. In May, Biden said that bill ""did not generate mass incarceration.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But just as Trump's most ardent fans excuse his excesses, including his<a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/14/year-dog-whistle-politics/?utm_term=.9b91113d1790"" target=""_blank""> racist dog whistles</a>, Biden's fervent supporters will find ways to accept his missteps. Given that the crime bill, like the Hyde Amendment, is now anathema to many Democrats, you might think his view is a handicap. However, if Biden is regarded as the person most capable of beating Trump in 2020, it may not matter.    </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many things that once mattered to voters no longer seem important. For a brief period, it appeared as if reports that presidential hopeful Sen. Amy Klobuchar<a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/03/amy-klobuchar-tough-on-vladimir-putin"" target=""_blank""> treated her aides harshly</a> would completely damage her chances. But just as repeated accounts of Trump being the hellion of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue have done little to dent his popularity with his base, Klobuchar's candidacy hasn't suffered any obvious hits. Elizabeth Warren was widely criticized for attempting to use a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-native-american.html"" target=""_blank"">DNA test </a>to confirm past claims of Native American ancestry, but her campaign is only gaining momentum. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even more remarkable is Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's resilience after news reports revealed a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/02/politics/northam-racist-yearbook-photo/index.html"" target=""_blank"">racist photo</a> on the page of his medical school yearbook.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Back in February, the yearbook photo -- which showed one person dressed in a Ku Klux Klan outfit standing next to another person in blackface -- sparked national outrage and calls for his resignation. Northam <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/02/politics/northam-racist-yearbook-photo/index.html"" target=""_blank"">initially said</a> he was in the photograph and apologized, before he denied being in the photograph at all.

Both men hunkered down and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/us/virginia-scandal-northam-fairfax.html"" target=""_blank"">then gradually resumed their public lives</a>. Lately, Northam and Fairfax have been conducting business as usual, and folks in Virginia seem to accept it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What do the cases of Fairfax, Northam, Klobuchar and Biden tell us?  They tell us that the old rules, which called for consistency, sober behavior, and good manners are less powerful than they were in the past. Trump blew those rules out of the water, and now others are benefitting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2016, the outsider Trump and his team defied convention and relied on tribalism and confusion to carry them to victory. If other candidates end up following a similar playbook and ignoring their own records under the assumption that they'll get away with it -- we'll have Trump to thank. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Look, without tariffs, we would be captive to every country, and we have been for many years.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump directly followed Myron Brilliant, the head of international affairs at the Chamber of Commerce, on the show.<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/trump-weaponization-of-tariffs-going-to-hurt-us-chamber-of-commerce.html"" target=""_blank""> Brilliant bashed Trump's ""weaponization of tariffs.""</a> And so Trump, the President of the United States, bashed him.

""I'm a member of the US Chamber -- maybe I'll have to rethink that, because when you look at it, the chamber is probably more for the companies and the people that are members than they are for our country.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President disagrees with the Chamber on the impact of tariffs so he publicly threatens to leave the group and then suggests they are only looking out for big companies rather than the broader country. Sure! Normal stuff! </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>3. ""Because without tariffs, we would be absolutely, outside of something that I won't even mention, we would be absolutely in a competitive disadvantage, the likes of which you've never seen.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Wait, what is the ""something"" Trump won't even mention? Is this like saying Voldemort's name?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>4.  ""Now, people haven't used tariffs, but tariffs are a beautiful thing when you're the piggy bank, when you have all the money.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In sum: Tariffs are beautiful. But only when you are a piggy bank. And have ""all the money.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>5.

""Well, there's something going on.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This conspiratorial answer from Trump is in response to this question: ""Mr. President, the treatment of you, set aside with Google and Facebook, just in terms of market size and market dominance, do you think that there is a monopoly antitrust problems with those big companies?"" What, specifically, is Trump talking about ""going on?"" Does he even know?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>25.

Over the weekend, Russian reporters took turns <a href=""https://cnn.com/2019/06/09/europe/ivan-golunov-russia-house-arrest-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">staging solo protests</a>, lining up to hold placards outside the Moscow branch of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Those single-person pickets -- which do not require a permit -- continued into Monday evening.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The vigils were a spontaneous burst of protest in a country where political speech is often tightly controlled. And Russian media organizations -- both independent and pro-Kremlin -- rallied to Golunov's cause.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Monday, three leading Russian business newspapers published identical front pages with the headline: ""I/We are Ivan Golunov."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was a phrase reminiscent of <a href=""https://cnn.com/2015/01/07/world/social-media-jesuischarlie/index.html"" target=""_blank"">""Je suis Charlie,"" </a>the slogan that went viral after the 2015 mass shooting at the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Equally striking was support from Russia's celebrities, artists and performers. Many Russian celebrities posted videos calling for Golunov's release, calling his case an important test for the rule of law.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's crucial that Ivan Golunov walks free not only for himself and for his loved ones, friends or colleagues,"" said rapper Oxxxymiron (Miron Fedorov). ""It's crucial for the whole society and all of us.

Police initially released images from his apartment that appeared to show a kind of drug laboratory, but subsequently backtracked, saying most of the images were not from Golunov's apartment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even the Kremlin has acknowledged conflicting information in the case.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked to respond to comment on the police statements, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said: ""We have paid attention to the corrections that were later published, and we also proceed from the fact that there are several issues that are in need of a clarification.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Peskov's comments were the closest the Kremlin has come to acknowledging the public outcry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If convicted, Golunov could be jailed for 10 to 20 years. Meanwhile, Meduza, his employer, and other media outlets have raised questions about his treatment in custody.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The ambulance doctor who examined Golunov in police custody said the journalist had a concussion, bruising and possible broken ribs. Police subsequently allowed him to be examined, according to a statement from the Moscow branch of the interior ministry, and a prominent doctor said there was no need for him to be hospitalized -- although some questioned the doctor's political motives for saying so.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Speaking in the courtroom, an emotional Golunov clearly appeared to be under enormous stress.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This is all very hard, it's like in a movie,"" he said, before breaking down and crying.

After a while, Nicole asked Mack to let her out of the group.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She said that she couldn't let me out no matter how hard I cried because it would show me that if I cried hard enough, I could get out of anything,"" she testified. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nicole stayed in DOS for more than a year after that conversation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Marc Agnifilo, a defense attorney for Raniere, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/07/us/nxivm-trial-begins-tuesday/index.html"" target=""_blank"">previously told CNN</a> that Raniere firmly believes his are sound, humanitarian ideas.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He thinks DOS is a good idea and is a pro-woman group. He created it to have women have their own society ... where men would play no role,"" Agnifilo said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>'Now, go be a good slave'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mack eventually gave her an assignment: Reach out to Raniere until he responds, Nicole said. Nicole emailed him multiple times, with no response. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""How do you get the attention of the smartest man in the world?"" multiple messages from Mack to Nicole read. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Raniere eventually asked Nicole if she wanted to go on a walk. The two would have long, personal conversations. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One morning before a walk, Mack told Nicole to tell Raniere that Nicole would do anything he asked her to do. ""Now, go be a good slave,"" Nicole testified Mack told her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At one point, Raniere lead Nicole into a home where he asked her to take off her clothes and commented on her body. Then, he had her put her clothes back on along with two blindfolds. She said one was so tight it left marks under her eyes. Then he led her to a car and drove her to a wooded area. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nicole said she remembers being led into a small cabin with only a table. Raniere asked her to take off her clothes again, and tied her wrists and ankles to the table corners. Then, she felt somebody begin to perform oral sex on her. As she started processing what was happening, she heard Raniere start asking her questions about her sexual history.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I realized there was another person in the room,"" she testified. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She later found out that it was a woman who performed oral sex on her. CNN is not naming the woman, who prosecutors previously alleged Raniere had sex with when she was a minor. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Prosecutors say the entire incident was being videotaped, unbeknownst to Nicole. She said Raniere asked her if she was OK and she replied yes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Raniere eventually took her back to the home where he blindfolded her and took the blindfold off and again asked her if she was OK. She said she was in shock but said yes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He said he wanted me to know that nothing bad had just happened, and that I was a young woman who was allowed to be sexual and I was not in a relationship so what happened was not bad,"" Nicole testified. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Agnifilo has maintained that his client's sexual relationships were consensual. Agnifilo asked Nicole if Raniere had been nice to her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Wasn't Keith sweet to you?"" Agnifilo asked. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nicole acknowledged that Raniere never yelled at her, adding, ""He has other people do it.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After the incident when Nicole was tied to the table, Raniere texted her, telling her he thought that she was ""very courageous,"" she testified. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nicole said Mack eventually asked her to sign a contract saying she was a willing participant in the activities, and that she was aware of the risks of psychological or physical injury, ""temporary or permanent disability including paralysis."" She never signed the contract and after leaving Nxivm in 2017, asked Mack for her collateral back, which she never received. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Once I'd gotten enough separation, there's not been one moment that I am not grateful that I am no longer in that situation,"" Nicole testified.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""This is a corporate initiative, the 'Code Red' alert, and behind the scenes many of us have tried to dissuade it for the last few months, to try something else that's less controversial to the viewers.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crain hasn't appeared on air since, and his job may now be on the line. In addition, several companies have stopped advertising with the station in solidarity with Crain and his commentary against the corporate decision-makers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crain has worked at WICS, which is a CNN affiliate, since 2004. His profile page on <a href=""https://newschannel20.com/station/people"" target=""_blank"">WICS' website</a> was removed after his commentary was broadcast. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crain declined to comment to CNN on his employment status. WICS did not respond a request for comment, and its owner, Sinclair Broadcasting Group, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2019/06/07/tv-meteorologist-objected-managements-code-red-orders-on-air-apology-he-might-be-out-job/?utm_term=.01a91a82ecd0"" target=""_blank"">statement to The Washington Post</a>, Sinclair public relations officer Ronn Torossian wrote that ""we're glad they [issued a code red]. That afternoon there was significant storm damage in the area including trees falling on homes, downed power lines, and hail storms. Thankfully, residents were adequately warned to prepare.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the Post, Sinclair also said that the seemingly constant red alert days were the product of an active weather pattern and that the decision to issue a code red alert is made by local meteorologists, </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sinclair is the largest owner of local TV stations in the US, and the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/politics/sinclair-trust-in-local-news/index.html"" target=""_blank"">company's role and media influence has come under heightened scrutiny</a> in the past couple years. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sinclair's role is particularly important because, according to a 2017 <a href=""http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/09/13163039/PJ_17.08.23_socialMediaUpdate_TOPLINE.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pew Research Center study</a>, 37% of Americans say they often watch local television news.

It doesn't recognize that not all storms are created equal,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The National Weather Service, he noted, puts out a 1-5 scale on severe weather that shows how frequent the storms are and their intensity.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""On the other hand, Code Red was created by, likely, a journalism school graduate,"" he said. ""That being said, I'm a journalism school graduate.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He acknowledged criticisms of the alert from viewers in the form of ""thousands"" of comments on social media, in letters to the editor and in calls to local radio shows. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For example, just days before his monologue, a viewer wrote a scathing letter published in<a href=""https://www.sj-r.com/opinion/20190603/letter-code-red-weather-alerts-are-getting-old"" target=""_blank""> The State Journal-Register</a>, the daily newspaper in Springfield, saying he was ""sick to death"" of the alerts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It would appear that any cloud in the sky will warrant a 'Code Red.' Indeed, we have three or four for this week alone!"" wrote Victor Edwards of Springfield. ""This is something like the boy who cried wolf, or Chicken Little, and what it does is make the viewers skeptical of anything the weather people say when not a single one eventuates.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In his commentary, Crain said he understood the criticism of the name ""Code Red"" and the seriousness that implies. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Certainly, when you hear Code Red, you think, as they say, the feces is about to hit the fan,"" he said. ""So with that being said, we understand your concerns and we want you to know that we take them very seriously, as far as myself goes. I don't take myself very seriously, but I do take my job seriously and my responsibility to the public.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Finally, he said that the issue was a ""corporate initiative,"" and he encouraged viewers to continue sending in their feedback.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""So, keep in mind, despite the fact that this facility is owned by a corporation, it's still licensed under the authority by the Federal Communications Commission to serve the public interest, convenience and necessity, so you still have a voice.

Of his 20 seasons in Major League Baseball, he spent 14 of them in Boston as the Red Sox's designated hitter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2004, he helped the Red Sox to its first championship since 1918, ending the so-called ""Curse of the Bambino."" Fans, mostly tongue-in-cheek, blamed the team's decades-long championship drought on the 1919 decision to trade legend Babe Ruth, aka the Bambino, to the rival New York Yankees.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ortiz was also on the Red Sox title teams of 2007 and 2013. He was named World Series MVP in 2013.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The 2013 championship came just months after the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and wounded more than 200 others. Ortiz emerged as a champion for the city in the bombings' aftermath, and his tribute to Boston the day after police captured the bomber gained national attention.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This jersey that we wear today, it doesn't say Red Sox. It says Boston,"" Ortiz said, standing on the infield as the crowd cheered police officers who were on the field.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This is our f***ing city, and nobody's going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3> What's the status of the investigation?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">National police have not formally interviewed Ortiz, said spokesman Capt. Luis Manuel Pimentel, adding that the former ballplayer was ""pretty beat up.""

Trump, whose disdain, even contempt and apparent hatred for many members of the press is almost daily on display.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Acosta cites instance after instance when this President and many of his staff show that they are bent on interfering with the ability of reporters to bring the public an accurate account of the administration's stewardship.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For most of his adult life, President Trump courted the press, lived for its attention, even for a time pretended he was someone else when calling reporters to sing Trump's praises. Whether now he truly believes that the mainstream press, as he says, reports ""fake"" news and is the ""enemy of the American people,"" or that such language is simply part of a tactic meant to stoke the anger of his ""base"" while escaping an objective accounting of his actions doesn't matter. The effect is to undermine the credibility of the media, leaving him free to pursue policies that harm us at home and abroad.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's wholesale attack on the mainstream press is wrong, and it is dangerous.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">History shows that tyrants and would-be tyrants always attempt to destroy a free press. And that is why the First Amendment to our Constitution specifically forbids government from interfering with the work of the press.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I spent 52 years as a reporter in Washington, 16 of them as the White House Correspondent for ABC News, covering Presidents Carter and Reagan and President Clinton's second term.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, none of us likes personal criticism, particularly a president trying to do arguably the toughest job in the world while ""the nattering nabobs of negativism,"" as Vice President Spiro Agnew once put it, are picking at his failures as well as reporting on his triumphs.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the Presidents I covered in one way or another, starting in the Kennedy administration (and with the exception of Richard Nixon), fundamentally understood and accepted the important role of the press.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They bridled privately and occasionally publicly (President Kennedy once canceled the Republican-leaning New York Herald Tribune's White House subscriptions, and President Johnson hit back at the press reporting on the Vietnam War) but they understood that no one had dragged them kicking and screaming to their illustrious and important post. They realized Harry Truman got it right when he said, ""If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I occasionally heard from the White House staff (never the President) that my reporting was unfair, that some of my questions were too sharp and, in the press briefings, along with the UPI's redoubtable Helen Thomas, would get into fierce arguments with the press secretary. But it was never personal on either side.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once, returning from a Carter trip to Japan, Press Secretary Jody Powell threw a full glass of red wine at me. Powell said some days later he lived in dread that I might go public with a complaint of anti-press mistreatment. It told him I was a bit upset -- that was good red wine and I had wanted to drink it!</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Back then, press secretaries tried to put the best face on it when things went badly for their boss. But they didn't lie to you, as Mr. Trump's press secretaries have done regularly, and they didn't call you names to your face. Both sides recognized the responsibilities of each other's jobs, and we got along.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Compared to what I see today, my time covering Presidents and their press secretaries was a cakewalk.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When I asked President Carter to respond to the critics who were saying he was ""failing as President,"" when I asked President Reagan how he could defend the ""hypocrisy"" of selling arms to Iran at the same time as asking our allies to respect an arms embargo on that county, when I asked President Clinton if it was true when a woman publicly raised the charge of ""rape,"" each of them responded with an answer, not with an attack on me.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Jim Acosta tried to ask President Trump perfectly reasonable and appropriate questions at a televised news conference last November, he was called ""a rude, terrible person"" by Mr. Trump, who said CNN should be ashamed for employing him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And no president before in history, as far as we can ascertain, ever attempted to ""lift"" a reporter's White House pass because he didn't like the reporter's questions.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Acosta's pass was taken away by Trump's White House after the November news conference, a federal judge <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/judge-hands-cnn-victory-in-its-bid-to-restore-jim-acostas-white-house-press-pass/2018/11/16/8bedd08a-e920-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?utm_term=.ac6a97790fb3"" target=""_blank"">ordered its restoration</a>. When he doesn't like a judge's decision, President Trump is fond of saying that it was done by an ""Obama judge,"" but he can't say that in this case; this judge was nominated by him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Acosta and CNN were attacked by President Trump in November, CNN management was not cowed, but issued a statement, saying, ""We stand behind Jim Acosta and his fellow journalists everywhere.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It reminds me of the time when the Nixon White House attacked Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein for their early Watergate reporting.

But unlike the 1990s boom — which included steady job creation, low inflation and a surging stock market — this latest expansion has been more like a prolonged, <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/01/news/economy/recession-anniversary/index.html"" target=""_blank"">gradual crawl</a>. It took years for America to emerge from its worst setback since the Great Depression.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The recovery has also been uneven. It started at different times in different parts of the country, lifting some people more than others. And now, questions are intensifying around <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/economy/us-recession-risk-nabe/index.html"" target=""_blank"">just how close America is to the end</a> of this business cycle, and what — if anything — could finally bring it to an end. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Let's take a look at the ten years since the economy bottomed out to see where things stand. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Employment is booming</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The share of Americans who want a job and can't find one, known as the unemployment rate, is one of the clearest indications that the US economy has returned to health. At <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/economy/jobs-report-may/index.html"" target=""_blank"">3.6% in May</a>, the rate has been hovering near 50-year lows. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm"" target=""_blank"">consumer sentiment </a>has reached historic highs. CNN polls also show that 7 in 10 Americans <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/cnn-poll-trump-prediction-economy-issues/index.html"" target=""_blank"">think the US economy is in ""good shape""</a> or better.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Part of the reason that unemployment is so low is that employers have more open positions than they can easily find workers to fill them. The job openings rate, which measures job listings as a percentage of the total number employed, zoomed past the hiring rate in 2015. There have been <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/charts/job-openings-and-labor-turnover/unemp-per-job-opening.htm"" target=""_blank"">more job openings than workers</a> to fill them since early 2018, meaning that there's theoretically a job for everyone — if they're in the right places, with the right qualifications. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That doesn't mean that everyone has as much work as they want, however. A <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE"" target=""_blank"">broader measure of underemployment</a>, which also captures discouraged workers and those who want to work more hours, was slower to sink and still hasn't reached its lowest point on record, in 2000. Also, the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300060"" target=""_blank"">labor force participation rate</a> for people in their prime working years — which measures the share of the population who either have jobs or are looking for one — remains a full percentage point below its pre-recession high and two points below the all-time high in 1999.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The tightening labor market also took a long time to translate into higher wages, with average hourly earnings growth topping 3% in 2018, not counting inflation. Many employers have added non-wage benefits like better health care and help repaying student loans, but those total<a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECIALLCIV"" target=""_blank""> compensation costs</a> still haven't topped the 3.5% year-over-year growth rates reached before the recession. Also, those gains have<a href=""https://www.frbatlanta.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker.aspx"" target=""_blank""> flowed disproportionately</a> to people switching jobs — workers who stay with one employer for long periods of time still aren't always getting regular raises. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Why have wages been slow to recover? Economists generally chalk it up to the decline of labor unions, slow <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/economy/productivity-recovery/index.html"" target=""_blank"">productivity growth</a>, automation that allows employers to replace workers if they get too expensive, and a continued influx of workers from the sidelines who may not have been able to afford to hold a job because childcare or transportation costs exceeded their wages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But economists argue that the longer unemployment remains very low, <a href=""https://www.cbpp.org/research/full-employment/the-increasing-benefits-and-diminished-costs-of-running-a-high-pressure"" target=""_blank"">the more ground</a> workers are <a href=""https://www.epi.org/blog/evidence-that-tight-labor-markets-really-will-increase-labors-share-of-income-economic-policy-institute-macroeconomics-newsletter/"" target=""_blank"">likely to regain</a> — especially those that employers have historically overlooked, like people of color, the disabled and the formerly incarcerated. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Markets roared back, but not everyone has benefited</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Most American businesses — or at least, those that survived the recession — didn't take long to return to profitability. As a percentage of GDP, after-tax profits have been <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mmnQ"" target=""_blank"">significantly higher</a> than they were during previous decades, as the<a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173"" target=""_blank""> share of corporate income</a> going to labor has declined.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The stock market started rebounding almost immediately and has hit record after record, driven in part by loose monetary policy that propped up asset values. Even after a couple of stumbles brought on by instability in China and a confluence of factors at the end of 2018, the S&amp;P 500 has still more than quadrupled in value since bottoming out in February 2009. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That sustained bull market didn't help everyone, however. Only 54% of Americans say they own stocks either directly or through a 401(k), according to a <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/211052/stock-ownership-down-among-older-higher-income.aspx?g_source=link_NEWSV9&amp;g_medium=TOPIC&amp;g_campaign=item_&amp;g_content=U.S.%2520Stock%2520Ownership%2520Down%2520Among%2520All%2520but%2520Older%2c%2520Higher-Income"" target=""_blank"">Gallup poll in 2017</a>, down from 65% in 2007. Wealthier people were able to buy low during the downturn and benefit from ten years of gains, while poorer people had to get by on their wages, contributing to the continued rise in wealth inequality in the post-recession period. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Housing prices recovered as well, but more so in tech hubs like San Francisco, New York, even <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/01/news/economy/colorado-housing-prices/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Denver</a> and Portland. Those are also the cities where zoning restrictions have kept a lid on housing supply, sending prices soaring as high-paying tech employers flocked to previously-abandoned city centers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In those places, high housing prices are bad news for renters, who have faced much <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=o6Mi"" target=""_blank"">steeper increases in the cost of shelter</a> as a result of the years-long drought in non-luxury apartment construction that developers are <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/07/24/politics/affordable-housing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">still trying to build their way out of</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In other places, housing values remain depressed. Smaller cities in the industrial Midwest were hit hard by the <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP"" target=""_blank"">drop-off in manufacturing employment</a> during the recession. Even after tens of thousands of vacant properties were demolished and the foreclosure rate virtually disappeared, homes are still worth far less than they were in sections of Detroit, Cleveland and Erie — which has a <a href=""https://www.epi.org/blog/ohios-economy-no-longer-fully-recovers-after-recessions/"" target=""_blank"">lingering impact</a> on residents' financial well-being. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Warning signs are on the horizon</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For both consumers and businesses, memories of widespread defaults and bankruptcies have faded fast, and we are living in a new era of debt. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cheap capital has prompted companies to take nearly as much leverage as ever as a percentage of the economy. Much of it has gone into <a href=""https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/is-there-too-much-business-debt.html"" target=""_blank"">share buybacks and acquisitions</a>, propelling a movement towards consolidation that some argue has <a href=""https://hbr.org/2018/03/is-lack-of-competition-strangling-the-u-s-economy"" target=""_blank"">retarded business dynamism and stifled innovation</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although total mortgage debt has subsided — in part because so many people lost their homes through foreclosure after the financial crisis — Americans have racked up more credit card debt than ever and student debt has <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FGCCSAQ027S"" target=""_blank"">multiplied nearly sevenfold</a> since the end of the recession, as people took refuge from a bad job market by going back to school. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">More important than the raw amount of debt, however, is the difficulty consumers are having when they try to pay it back. Here, student debt is <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/01/us/student-loan-debt-stories-trnd/index.html"" target=""_blank"">proving to be the biggest problem</a>: Delinquency rates for student loans have surpassed those for home loans, since the jobs graduates got weren't always well-paid enough to keep up with rent, grocery and loan payments at the same time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike mortgages, student loans can't be discharged in bankruptcy. And there's mounting evidence that those heavy debt burdens have kept young people in particular from purchasing their first homes, although the overall <a href=""https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RHORUSQ156N"" target=""_blank"">homeownership rate</a> has rebounded to its historic average. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Finally, government borrowing has also ballooned as a percentage of GDP over the last decade. It started during the Great Recession, when the government passed several stimulus measures to resuscitate the economy. The national debt should have subsided as tax revenues recovered, but <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/16/politics/federal-deficits-gop/index.html"" target=""_blank"">massive tax cuts in 2017</a> <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/13/economy/22-trillion-debt/index.html"" target=""_blank"">only added more red ink</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">All that debt is only sustainable if interest rates remain as low as they have been on account of the Federal Reserve's prolonged strategy of buying US Treasuries in order to stimulate the economy. But an interest rate shock would swamp many deeply indebted companies in short order. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's why it's important to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/13/news/economy/financial-crisis-10-years-later-lehman/index.html"" target=""_blank"">think about the risks</a> — which at the moment center mostly around international trade. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The United States' negative trade balance with other countries isn't necessarily a problem in itself, since American consumers benefit from products made more cheaply in other countries, and American businesses often locate their more knowledge-intensive jobs on their home turf. But it has proven a political hot potato, as President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened tariffs countries he says are ""taking advantage"" of the United States. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Whether or not he's right, the escalating trade war <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/economy/us-recession-risk-nabe/index.html"" target=""_blank"">tops the list of concerns</a> for growth going forward for members of the National Association for Business Economics, whose most recent survey showed that 56% of its members saw trade tensions as the biggest downside risk for the economy in 2019. That doesn't necessarily mean tariffs will tank the recovery — but of course, <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act"" target=""_blank"">it's happened before</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>When will the expansion end?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although it's an imperfect measure, the single broadest measure of economic growth is gross domestic product, and by that metric, the US has been performing fairly consistently since 2014. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The economy has had only a handful of negative quarters since 2009, after four of them in a row. What's more, the US growth rate has remained significantly above those of most other developed countries, due in part to an oil and gas boom that has boosted exports and helped revive manufacturing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even that is dropping off, with most economists projecting growth on the order of 2% in 2019, down from almost 3% in 2018, and declining thereafter. In that scenario, the best the United States can hope for is that a slow march towards economic health just gets a bit slower, rather than erasing a decade of painful progress.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the US does end up in another recession, it may not be immediately obvious. The National Bureau of Economic Research, which <a href=""https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html"" target=""_blank"">officially dates the beginnings and ends of business cycles</a>, took 15 months to declare that the turning point had occurred in June 2009. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fortunately for America, research has found that long and deep recessions lead to more durable recoveries — not the other way around. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

He emigrated to San Francisco in 1925, where he joined a leftist art collective. During the Great Depression he was a supporter of workers' strikes and formally joined the Communist Party in 1937. He was even hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 for drawing a ""Communist Conspiracy"" cartoon that caricatured then-Vice President Nixon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In ""The Life of Washington,"" Arnautoff decided to place Native Americans, African Americans and working-class revolutionaries front and center in the four largest panels, relegating Washington to the margins.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The slaves toiling in the Mount Vernon fields highlight a central paradox of America's history: The nation was founded by men who championed liberty, freedom and equality, and yet owned slaves.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Then there's the striking image of the fallen Native American. The mural's detractors say that it dismisses the humanity of indigenous peoples. But why must it necessarily be read as dehumanizing to Native Americans? Could it not instead be seen as throwing into sharp relief the inhumanity of the founding fathers?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In his biography of Arnautoff, Robert W. Cherny, wrote that the image challenged the fallacy that ""westward expansion had been into largely vacant territory waiting for white pioneers to develop its full potential.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">There's a <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/san-francisco-high-school-may-destroy-historical-murals"" target=""_blank"">strong case</a> to be made that Arnautoff is exposing -- rather than celebrating -- slavery and genocide. As Native American Tamaka Bailey, of the Choctaw Nation, <a href=""https://twitter.com/tamaka3715/status/1127996787283775489"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: the murals ""do not glorify slavery but prove that (Washington) was a slave-owner"" and ""part of the Genocide of First Nation Peoples."" Moreover, those arguing for the mural's removal are overlooking the fact that African Americans are not only portrayed as picking cotton and that Native Americans are not only depicted as victims. Rather Arnautoff is insisting that African Americans and indigenous peoples were key historical actors in the making of the United States.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">That the mural appears in a school is particularly important. For decades, the country's educational institutions perpetuated national myths about American exceptionalism and American history as one long glorious march of forward progress. Up until the 1960s, the standard US history curriculum ignored the country's dark and terrifying history of racial violence, including enslavement and the slaughter of indigenous peoples. So drawing attention to the horrors inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans would have been a radical statement in 1930s America.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Many of those in favor of scrapping the murals seem to believe that merely depicting past atrocities justifies them. In fact, the Action and Reflection Working Group concluded that the mural contravened the San Francisco Unified School District's commitment to ""social justice.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Quite to the contrary. In our view, the ""Life of Washington"" is an invaluable resource for students to engage in a serious and sustained way with social justice issues. It provides a singular opportunity to cultivate historical literacy and to equip students with the skills to analyze and discuss difficult material. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">From new student orientation to classes in art, history and civics, this mural should be formally incorporated into the George Washington High School curriculum. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>Only the latest controversy</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The controversy over this mural is sadly not an isolated exception.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Over the past several years, there have been dozens of cases where plays, poems, books, prints, paintings, sculptures, installations and other creative works have been shut down, canceled, removed or otherwise censored based on snap judgments, social media swarms, ideologically motivated reasoning and obtuse interpretations of the art in question.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In all of these cases, there has been little to no regard for the aspirations, aims and ambitions of the artists themselves. Their intentions have been treated along a spectrum that runs from indifference to contempt.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">To be clear, we are not saying that an artist's intent is all that matters. How people interpret and respond to a work of art is inseparable from its raison d'etre.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But disregarding the intentions of artists would place every significant creative work with a whiff of controversy in jeopardy because of its ""problematic"" or ""offensive"" content. In a world where intentionality and context are irrelevant, satire and irony would not only be incomprehensible but forbidden.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Mark Twain's frequent invocation of the n-word in ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""? Just a vicious rehearsal of a profoundly damaging racial slur. Artist Kara Walker's searing paper cuts depicting the horrific violence of slavery in the United States?

In fairness, he appears to be doing a sub-par job without them. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I have mixed feelings about heels at work. A decent metal spike under your feet can feel powerful, almost warrior-like. As a relatively short person (I'm 5 feet, 3 inches tall), I can testify that heels can be a genuine asset when trying to assert authority. They're often the difference between looking up at a boss who already infantilizes you or looking them in the eye. I've been called a ""girl"" by bosses for years who never referred to my male colleagues of the same age as ""boys,"" and I'm certain this was in part because I am physically small. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But wearing heels is also fraught with complicating factors. They mildly incapacitate you. They make you swing your hips and walk more slowly and can play into<a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/08/mad-mens-very-modern-sexism-problem/60788/"" target=""_blank""> irritating Mad Men-esque stereotypes</a> of being a woman in an office, or Sex and the City tropes of sinking whole paychecks into the cost of designer shoes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Tall women who are obliged to wear heels at the office tower over everyone, which is cool, but not necessarily every wearer's first choice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Too often, how to dress becomes a toss-up between being taken seriously as an adult woman or objectified as one. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The professional histories of my friends, acquaintances and people who responded when I asked about this on social media are rich with stories of heel-related woe. Many of these were purely physical. Several who had worked as waitresses in recent years recalled that compulsory heels made the manual work significantly harder -- in one instance, to the point that an ice bucket was provided for the female staff to soak their feet in after the shift. She was quick to point out that this was an inclusive bucket -- ""men were allowed to use it too!"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Compromises aren't only health-related. A friend told me that when she worked as an agency waitress, to take the (better-paid) option of hostess shifts, women had to wear high heels -- which weren't provided by the company -- for the 12-hour shifts. She declined.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The implications for spending a lot of time on your feet in heels are serious. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36265545"" target=""_blank"">It takes an average</a> of one hour, six minutes, and 48 seconds for feet in high heels to start hurting feet and legs. They can cause bunions, back problems, ankle sprains and tight calves. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The University of Alabama at Birmingham has<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25977152"" target=""_blank""> published research</a> showing that high heel-related injuries in the US had doubled over the preceding decade, with emergency rooms treating 123,355 people for them. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Despite the obvious physical risks involved,<a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36265545"" target=""_blank""> laws vary widely</a> when it comes to employee dress codes. In 2017, the Canadian province of British Columbia<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/08/canadian-province-makes-it-illegal-to-require-women-to-wear-high-heels"" target=""_blank""> amended the workplace act</a> to make it illegal for employers to require women to wear heels, calling them a threat to employee health and safety. But the situation in many places is far less clear-cut.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier this year, Norwegian Air drew heavy criticism for requiring female cabin crew to carry a doctor's note if they wanted to wear flat shoes. A <a href=""https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/129823"" target=""_blank"">2016 petition</a> to change British law was <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-39667912"" target=""_blank"">rejected</a>, despite employers frequently discriminating against women. And in the US, where<a href=""https://equitablegrowth.org/gender-segregation-at-work-separate-but-equal-or-inequitable-and-inefficient/"" target=""_blank""> ""separate but equal""</a> remains the prevailing norm, much tends to depend on the<a href=""https://www.bizfilings.com/toolkit/research-topics/office-hr/instituting-a-dress-code-thats-legal-and-appropriate-for-your-workplace"" target=""_blank""> individual policy</a> of the employer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even when there is no dress code, there is an unofficial assumption that women will wear them in many jobs. A former legal secretary in London told me that when she didn't wear heels, her boss would complain behind her back that she looked ""frumpy"" and ""dressed like an old woman."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The conflicting associations we have with heels, that they are smart, sexy, superficial, femme, or powerful, have all been projected onto them by people. Unless you're in a working environment where heels impede your performance, or are stupidly risky, the choice between heels or no heels should be up to the wearer, whatever their gender. If anyone takes issue with or makes assumptions based on that, that's not the shoe-wearer's problem. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For my welcome lunch during the first week of a new job several years ago, I wore a smart skirt, heels and some makeup. I figured it was a superficial demonstration of effort-making which might be appreciated early on.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As my new, male boss sat down to this lunch attended by myself and 10 other men, he remarked: ""Well Holly, you can bring a little glamor to this bunch!"" It was well-meant, but for me at least, it set a weird, mildly archaic tone. It felt like my effort to be taken seriously had been interpreted as frivolous. My boss didn't highlight any of my professional experience, or comment on anything else I might have to offer, during that lunch. I don't wear heels for anyone besides myself, now.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Nadler is seeking notes authored by former White House officials and notes of the FBI's interviews with witnesses, although the White House will likely have an opportunity to weigh in on congressional access to at least some of the documents lawmakers have demanded -- a signal that a longer, more complicated process could be on the horizon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In addition to the subpoenas for Barr and McGahn, the resolution also includes language empowering committees to go to court to enforce subpoenas in the future while bypassing a floor vote, a potential prelude to more litigation pitting the Trump administration against House Democrats.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Already, the House is fighting a number of lawsuits against the Trump administration as well as the Trump Organization, including related to the Affordable Care Act, Trump's border wall and subpoenas to banks and accounting firms. Tuesday's vote is a sign that House Democrats plan to escalate their court battles against the Trump administration and Trump's private businesses.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadler said he wanted to go to court ""as soon as possible"" to try to force McGahn to testify, although the timing would ultimately be decided by the House counsel. And he added that he would go to court to force former White House aides Hope Hicks and Annie Donaldson to comply with the panel's subpoenas for the officials to testify later this month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The administration's obstruction not only violates long established precedent, it endangers our very democracy,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the floor ahead of the vote. ""(The Trump) administration has employed every tool it can find to obstruct legitimate committee oversight -- everything from witness intimidation to blanket stonewalling to spurious claims of executive privilege, absolute immunity, and lack of legislative purpose.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The resolution is a tangible step that House Democrats took Tuesday to bolster their investigations against the Trump administration's resistance, but it's unlikely to resolve the simmering dispute within the caucus over impeachment. Earlier Tuesday, Pelosi questioned whether Democrats' hand in court would be strengthened by an impeachment inquiry. Nadler, who has argued privately to begin an impeachment inquiry, said at a news conference after Tuesday's vote that congressional power was ""at its zenith in an impeachment inquiry.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The lawyers tell us that in weighing the equities between the competing claims of the executive and the legislative branches, we have very substantial powers,"" he said. ""The congressional power is at its zenith in an impeachment inquiry. How much of a difference — it is a different question.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Republicans charge that the Democratic subpoena for McGahn is misguided. They issued a report ahead of Tuesday's vote arguing that the White House, not McGahn, has control of the documents Democrats are seeking, that the committee has not addressed the White House's claim of immunity from having the President's close advisers testify and that the President did not waive executive privilege when McGahn spoke to the special counsel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Republican arguments in the report are likely to be similar to those that the Trump administration makes in court when it fights the subpoena.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Democrats of passing Tuesday's resolution in a ""desperate attempt to relitigate the Mueller investigation.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Democrats say we're in a constitutional crisis and they're right, but not because of Attorney General Barr. The true constitutional crisis is this: If Democrats can't win, they change the rules,"" McCarthy said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While Nadler said Monday he would not take court action against Barr so long as the Justice Department acted in ""good faith,"" he also did not rule out doing so in the future if the Justice Department stopped cooperating.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I am pleased that we have reached an agreement to review at least some of the evidence underlying the Mueller report -- including interview notes, first-hand accounts of misconduct, and other critical evidence -- and that this material will be made available without delay to members on both sides of the aisle,"" Nadler said. ""As a result, I see no need to resort to the criminal contempt statute to enforce our April 19 subpoena, at least for now, so long as the Department upholds its end of the bargain.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even before Nadler had struck the agreement with the Justice Department, the House had not planned to pursue criminal contempt of Congress on the House floor, as the resolution introduced last week only referenced the court action, which is known colloquially as ""civil contempt.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After Nadler agreed last month to narrow the scope of his subpoena -- which initially asked for the unredacted Mueller report and all of the special counsel's evidence -- the Justice Department had said it could negotiate with the panel so long as contempt did not move forward.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A Justice Department official said the department views Tuesday's vote as only dealing with court action, and not related to contempt.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But more contempt fights -- and likely lawsuits -- are looming.

Amash's voting record is regularly one of the most conservative in the House; in 2018, he had a perfect 100% on the <a href=""https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/app/?party=all&amp;chamber=H&amp;yr=2018&amp;state=all&amp;rep"" target=""_blank"">Club for Growth vote scorecard</a>, and he has a 99% lifetime score.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In short: Amash is the perfect poster boy for the Freedom Caucus: An unapologetic conservative who is willing to stand up to an establishment GOP which too often compromises rather than fighting on principle. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Which makes Amash's <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/justin-amash-leaves-freedom-caucus/index.html"" target=""_blank"">decision to resign</a> from the Freedom Caucus on Monday night all the more telling.

""I didn't want to be a further distraction for the group.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Amash's resignation from the group he helped form four years ago comes less than a month after the Michigan Republican drew national headlines for a series of tweets in which he said he had concluded -- after reading the Mueller report -- that President Donald Trump had committed impeachable acts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Contrary to [Attorney General William] Barr's portrayal, Mueller's report reveals that President Trump engaged in specific actions and a pattern of behavior that meet the threshold for impeachment,"" Amash <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/18/politics/justin-amash-trump-impeachable-conduct/index.html"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a> last month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those tweets were greeted with condemnation from the House Freedom Caucus, which held an internal vote to condemn their colleague. (Former Freedom Caucus chair Jim Jordan <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/20/amash-freedom-caucus-1336684"" target=""_blank"">reportedly called Amash soon after his tweets</a> to ask, ""What are you doing?"") House minority leader Kevin McCarthy was even more blunt, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/20/politics/justin-amash-primary-challenge-impeachment/index.html"" target=""_blank"">telling Fox News</a> that ""it's a question whether [Amash is] even in our Republican conference as a whole,"" adding: ""He never supported the President, and I think he's just looking for attention.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, go back to that mission statement for the House Freedom Caucus. You won't find anything in it about unwavering support for a Republican president. Not a single word.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Amash wasn't ostracized by his Freedom Caucus colleagues -- and the broader GOP -- for abandoning the party on principle. (As I noted above, he is one of the most conservative members of Congress year after year.) Instead, he was driven from the Freedom Caucus because he voiced a dissenting opinion about Trump.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And that, in one very simple anecdote, tells you everything you need to now about the current state of the conservative movement and the broader Republican Party in the age of Trump. Being a ""conservative"" in this day and age means supporting Trump at all time and no matter what. Which is ironic, of course, because Trump wasn't a Republican until a few years before he ran for president in 2016. And even now, he trumpets views -- protectionist on trade, uncaring about debt and deficits, etc. -- that flout what used to be pillars of the modern conservative movement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Conservatives long prided themselves on the fact that they weren't a movement centered around a person but rather built on a foundation of ideas -- ideas that endured no matter who was in charge or what the political fad of the moment might be. Principles that transcended politics, that embraced the need for hard choices on difficult issues.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Now, for most conservatives in Congress, the movement really amounts to nothing more than a cult of personality. What Trump says goes -- even if it runs directly counter to those once-hallowed principles. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What changed? Well, when the Freedom Caucus initially formed, it was in response to what the members believed to be out-of-control spending and government-building by a Democratic president they loathed. Now, conservatives have a Republican President -- even if he isn't one who, if they are being honest with themselves, has many of the views they claimed to value. Many conservatives have clearly made the calculation that enough of Trump's policies -- deregulation of business, tax cuts, judges -- meet their goals that they will stand behind him no matter what he says or how he behaves. Which is, yes, somewhat short of principled. But is also politics 101.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, second, well, fear. Trump and his legion of supporters within the party base have shown that any dissenting opinions will be punished. (A state representative announced his plans to primary Amash shortly after the Michigan congressman made his comments.) Self-preservation is a powerful emotion -- and one that seems to have overrun many committed conservatives in the last three years.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The exit of Amash then is rightly understood as further evidence of the total takeover of the conservative movement by Trump. Principle replaced by personality. Foundational beliefs replaced by fear.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

It was <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/11/26/politics/hope-hicks-donald-trump-white-house/index.html"" target=""_blank"">one of the President's most trusted aides, Hope Hicks</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I wanted to let you know that I spoke with the President and he wants you to know that he thought you were very professional today,"" Hicks said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He said, 'Jim gets it,' "" she added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hicks had offered an insight into Trump's thinking. When the President called the press ""fake news,"" Hicks was essentially saying this was just an expression, part of the act, something I apparently ""get."" Other Trump aides and advisers confirmed this assessment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But what may have begun as something of a reality TV-style parlor trick has mutated into a full-blown assault on the American free press, one that the President apparently can no longer control.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The following day, Trump demonstrated he was fully capable of escalating his rhetoric aimed at the news media. It was a dark and dangerous tweet that may well define much of his presidency.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" he wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">More than 30 current and former administration officials, as well as other outside Trump advisers and high-ranking GOP officials, spoke with me for my book <em>""The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America,""</em> set for release Tuesday. Other officials from the administration, most notably Trump and White House press secretary Sanders, did not respond to repeated requests for an interview. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked where the term ""the enemy of the people"" came from, three former and current senior White House officials pointed the finger at the conservative firebrand Steve Bannon, an ex-West Wing strategist himself, as having coined the villainous label. Yet, in an interview, Bannon said that's not quite the case. The former Breitbart executive insisted he and Trump had conjured up the anti-press catchphrase together.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think it's safe to say that we both came up with it in discussion,"" Bannon said, making sure Trump received part of the credit. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think I threw out 'opposition media party' first, and then he threw out 'fake news is the enemy of the people,' "" Bannon added, referring to his own description of journalists as the ""opposition"" during the early days of the Trump administration.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/opinions/jim-acosta-book-trump-press-sam-donaldson/index.html"" target=""_blank"">OPINION: Sam Donaldson: What Jim Acosta is doing is exactly right</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Discounting the notion that such rhetoric could lead to violence against journalists, Bannon was careful to draw what he thought was an important distinction, noting that Trump doesn't regard all journalists as the ""enemy."" Only those reporters seen by the President as purveyors of ""fake news"" fit into that category, Bannon continued.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, in an interview for my book, said she did not agree with the use of that expression.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's fraught. It's danger --, "" Conway stopped midsentence, catching herself before saying ""dangerous.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think calling the President a Russian asset is dangerous,"" she added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't use that phrase. Yet there is ample evidence that the media are often the enemy of the relevant,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One senior White House official rejected Bannon's comments, saying he should be taking full responsibility for the ""enemy of the people"" term.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">"" 'Enemy of the people' was first said in this White House by somebody who spent all of his time talking to the media,"" the senior official said, referring to Bannon. ""It's absolutely Bannon."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, the original purpose of the expression was to taunt members of the press, not trigger threatening reactions from Trump supporters, the official said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's meant to incite the media. Not the people,"" the official continued. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bannon explained that Trump's use of the ""enemy"" label should be viewed as part of a larger media strategy aimed at mastering the nation's nonstop political news cycle, the same approach that allowed Trump to cut through 16 GOP presidential candidates like a ""scythe through grass,"" as Bannon put it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, some of the President's supporters have lashed out at the press after absorbing this volatile rhetoric, behaving in ways that have left journalists feeling endangered. This phenomenon can be seen in the death threats streaming into the social media accounts of news anchors and reporters who cover Trump on a regular basis. Popular apps such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook have done little to stem the flow of these violent messages. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If Trump is removed from office in any way, you are dead,"" read one message posted on my Instagram account.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Self-described Trump supporters have left messages recommending that I be castrated, decapitated and set on fire. Theirs was the same kind of hatred that had driven Trump supporter <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/26/media/cesar-sayoc-social-media-cnn-attacks/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Cesar Sayoc to send pipe bombs to CNN</a> and Democratic targets shortly before the midterm elections in 2018. His vivid threats directed at me on Twitter went undetected until authorities captured him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Handling falsehoods and 'alternative facts'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's unprecedented verbal attacks on the press, his chaotic management style and his assaults on the truth have often confounded his own advisers, placing some members of his beleaguered team in the position of explaining the President's outright falsehoods.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer falsely claimed in January 2017 that Trump had drawn the largest inauguration crowd in US history, Conway came to the spokesman's defense with a catchphrase that she now regrets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">"" 'Alternative facts' was a slip of the tongue. I rushed through 'alternative information and additional facts,' and it got mushed together,"" Conway said. ""It was never meant to be Orwellian or to excuse lies.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Conway and Spicer had their stumbles as they were attempting to explain outbursts from a President who excelled at creating disorder. As a former senior White House official said, much of Trump's chaotic behavior was by design.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He rules by instability. He wins by making everything around him unstable,"" the official told me. That way, the official said, Trump controls the chaos.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Intense frustration with Trump's management style has also led some senior White House and administration officials to arrive at damning assessments of the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The President's insane,"" one senior official said, in a moment of exasperation with Trump's behavior behind the scenes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked what the aide meant, the official complained Trump failed to understand the constraints on the executive branch built into the US Constitution by the nation's Founding Fathers, the guardrails installed to protect American democracy from the possibility of a rogue president.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What were the rules for appointing Cabinet officials and how long can acting secretaries stay on the job, Trump wanted to know, according to the official. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Unpredictable behavior abroad and at home</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's behavior around foreign leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, also puzzled senior members of his national security team.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Around the time of Putin's reelection in March 2018, Trump wanted to send the Russian leader a news clipping, signed by him, to wish the ex-KGB agent good luck, a senior administration official with direct knowledge of the situation said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Vladimir, you're going to do great,"" Trump was going to tell Putin, according to the official, who viewed the clipping but cautioned it was not certain whether the message was ultimately sent off to the Russian President. Still, the official raised concerns about Trump's gesture with other aides, worried that the clipping, should it somehow be released, could be an embarrassment for Trump and prompt more questions about the relationship between the two leaders. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Other people were aware,"" the official said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The official could not explain why Trump was so cozy with Putin.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I can't answer that question,"" the official confessed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's unpredictable behavior with foreign leaders was a constant source of consternation for former chief of staff John Kelly, who did not hide his unhappiness from other West Wing aides.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You didn't leave him alone, did you?"" Kelly once blurted out to a senior aide, the official said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Other officials in the administration questioned Trump's handling of his domestic agenda, such as his crackdown on migrants crossing the border with Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a rare public expression of concern with an administration initiative, Conway said she disagreed with the ""zero-tolerance"" policy that resulted in family separations at the border in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""As a mother, as a Catholic, as a person of conscience, I don't want children ripped from their parents,"" Conway said with regret, before adding she also didn't want to see families taken advantage of by ""smugglers and coyotes,"" a comment more in line with the administration's talking points on immigration.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the two years since Trump's election, one constant of his time in office has been his rallies. During the 2016 campaign, Trump began his assault on the media, referring to news outlets as ""dishonest"" and ""disgusting."" That routine has continued right into Trump's presidency as he has excited his base with rhetoric steeped in hostility toward journalists. Some of the President's supporters have joined in on the act, hurling insults at reporters inside the press filing spaces at the rallies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You're scum. You're a scumbag,"" yelled one man repeatedly for approximately 30 minutes at a rally last year in Nashville. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Out, out, out, out,"" shrieked an elderly woman at a rally later in the year in Columbia, South Carolina, whipping the crowd of thousands into a frenzy as she insisted that the CNN crew be ejected from the venue.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another woman at the Columbia rally warned me to tone down my questions to both the President and press secretary Sanders or face the consequences.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What's going to happen is we're going to end up with a civil war. You're going to have people shooting people,"" warned the woman.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At another rally a few weeks later in Tampa, Florida, large group of Trump supporters screamed and flashed middle fingers at me. Trump later retweeted a video of the incident, catapulting its viewership into the millions. The episode was followed by a string of disturbing messages left on my social media accounts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Hopefully he gets beaten to death at one soon,"" read one message left on my Instagram account.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

In addition, several companies have stopped advertising with the station in solidarity with Crain and his commentary against the corporate decision-makers.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crain has worked at WICS, which is a CNN affiliate, since 2004.

That afternoon there was significant storm damage in the area including trees falling on homes, downed power lines, and hail storms. Thankfully, residents were adequately warned to prepare.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the Post, Sinclair also said that the seemingly constant red alert days were the product of an active weather pattern and that the decision to issue a code red alert is made by local meteorologists, </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sinclair is the largest owner of local TV stations in the US, and the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/politics/sinclair-trust-in-local-news/index.html"" target=""_blank"">company's role and media influence has come under heightened scrutiny</a> in the past couple years. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sinclair's role is particularly important because, according to a 2017 <a href=""http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2017/09/13163039/PJ_17.08.23_socialMediaUpdate_TOPLINE.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Pew Research Center study</a>, 37% of Americans say they often watch local television news.

It doesn't recognize that not all storms are created equal,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The National Weather Service, he noted, puts out a 1-5 scale on severe weather that shows how frequent the storms are and their intensity.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""On the other hand, Code Red was created by, likely, a journalism school graduate,"" he said. ""That being said, I'm a journalism school graduate.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He acknowledged criticisms of the alert from viewers in the form of ""thousands"" of comments on social media, in letters to the editor and in calls to local radio shows. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For example, just days before his monologue, a viewer wrote a scathing letter published in<a href=""https://www.sj-r.com/opinion/20190603/letter-code-red-weather-alerts-are-getting-old"" target=""_blank""> The State Journal-Register</a>, the daily newspaper in Springfield, saying he was ""sick to death"" of the alerts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It would appear that any cloud in the sky will warrant a 'Code Red.' Indeed, we have three or four for this week alone!"" wrote Victor Edwards of Springfield. ""This is something like the boy who cried wolf, or Chicken Little, and what it does is make the viewers skeptical of anything the weather people say when not a single one eventuates.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In his commentary, Crain said he understood the criticism of the name ""Code Red"" and the seriousness that implies. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Certainly, when you hear Code Red, you think, as they say, the feces is about to hit the fan,"" he said.

Features like comments and sharing have been removed from the channel, and YouTube has added a warning that his videos contain ""inappropriate"" or ""offensive"" content. But a YouTube spokesperson told CNN Business that those actions predated the company's announcement last week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">The majority of videos on the account for the National Policy Institute, a white supremacist group that Spencer runs, do not contain any content warnings and most of the videos can still be shared and commented on.

YouTube also said it would remove hundreds of thousands of videos that it had not previously considered to be in violation of its policies. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A YouTube spokesperson declined to comment on specific accounts, but said that enforcement of the updated policy will take time and that the company will expand its coverage of the new rules over the next several months. The spokesperson also said accounts are removed after they have repeatedly violated YouTube's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/policies/#community-guidelines"" target=""_blank"">""Community Guidelines""</a> or if the channel is dedicated to violating YouTube's policies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How effectively YouTube will enforce its new policy is an open question. CNN Business found on Thursday that one Nazi channel that YouTube has twice before deleted was back up, and making no attempt to hide itself or its connection to the two previously banned accounts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The channel was first taken down in April 2018 in wake of a <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/technology/youtube-ads-extreme-content-investigation/index.html"" target=""_blank"">CNN investigation</a> which found that ads from over 300 companies and organizations ran on YouTube channels promoting white nationalists, Nazis, pedophilia, conspiracy theories and North Korean propaganda. Run by Brian Ruhe, who had emphasized to CNN in 2018 that he did not want to be referred to as a ""neo-Nazi,"" because he thinks of himself as a ""real, genuine and sincere Nazi,"" the account deleted on Wednesday had over 3,300 subscribers when it was taken down. Earlier this year, Ruhe had posted to the channel a video of himself and friends celebrating Adolf Hitler's birthday, complete with a cake featuring a Swastika made out of icing and ""Heil Hitler!"" salutes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even though that account was deleted, a new Brian Ruhe account was already up on the site and posting videos on Wednesday, only hours after YouTube's policy announcement.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After CNN Business asked YouTube about the new account, the company took it down. Ruhe confirmed to CNN Business that both accounts belonged to him. He said YouTube told him the accounts were taken down for ""severe or frequent violations"" of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech. But Ruhe claimed: ""I deny that I have hate or that I use hate speech."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">YouTube's policies and its enforcement of them can be vague and inconsistent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The company says its rules are based on content, and not the person behind the content. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But CNN Business' attempts to get answers as to YouTube's actions and thinking regarding several channels apparently owned by Ruhe were met with vague answers and new actions by YouTube that contradicted its previous positions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In addition to the new account Ruhe started Wednesday, CNN Business found two other accounts belonging to him. One focused on his brand of Buddhism; the other, which was dedicated to him livestreaming, contained only two lengthy videos, one of which included mentions of Adolf Hitler and Nazi ideology. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After CNN Business asked YouTube about the accounts, it removed the livestreaming account and the account that Ruhe had started after the new policy was announced last week, though not the account about Buddhism. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A cursory review of the account Ruhe started last week, though, did not reveal any content in obvious violation of YouTube's policies. When CNN Business asked YouTube why it was removed, since both it and the Buddhism account did not immediately seem to be in violation, YouTube responded by removing the Buddhism account. A YouTube spokesperson declined to provide any further explanation about these decisions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked why YouTube hadn't caught an account that had been banned twice before and was making no effort to hide what it was, the YouTube spokesperson said the platform relies on a combination of machine learning and user flags to address banned users making new accounts. The spokesperson also said YouTube removes reuploads of videos when flagged by its systems or users. The spokesperson declined to provide more details about how YouTube will address this issue in the future or how Ruhe was able to create multiple accounts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The company has long faced criticism for letting misinformation, conspiracy theories and extremist views spread on its platform. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The company takes action on videos that violate its policies in several ways. It says it has four ""pillars"" for protecting users from harmful content, including deleting videos, restricting features on ""borderline content,"" promoting authoritative voices, and rewarding trusted creators with the ability to make money from their channel, while demonetizing those who violate its hate speech policies. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">YouTube deletes videos for violating its guidelines, including uploading pornography, copyrighted material or content whose primary purpose is inciting hatred.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For videos that are what the company calls ""borderline content,"" it can opt to restrict certain features, such as removing the sidebar that appears to the right of most videos that recommends other content, or restricting the questionable videos from appearing on the ""recommended"" tab on the YouTube homepage. It can also add a content warning or disable comments. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While YouTube's community guidelines forbid ""racial, ethnic, religious, or other slurs where the primary purpose is to promote hatred,"" it has resisted removing Duke's page, which includes among other things, a video in which he rails against the ""Zionist Matrix of Power"" that he falsely claims ""controls Media, Politics and Banking."" Instead, YouTube has chosen to strip away several features from his videos, such as disabling comments, removing the sidebar next to the video that recommends videos and adding a content warning filter. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">YouTube can also take action on a channel by cutting off its ability to make money, such as through ads running on its videos. It's unclear whether Duke and Spencer have the ability to monetize their channels, but neither channel appears to have ads running on them.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">YouTube's new policies come after <span>Facebook</span> <span>(<span class=""inlink_chart""><a class=""inlink"" href=""https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FB&amp;source=story_quote_link"">FB</a></span>)</span> said in March it was banning white supremacist content from its platforms. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/27/tech/facebook-white-nationalism-ban/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Facebook's ban</a> came after the suspect in the terror attack at two New Zealand mosques live streamed part of the massacre on its platform. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Jon Sarlin and Paul P.

No More Deaths is one of several humanitarian aid groups that use The Barn as a staging area for search-and-rescue operations and for the placement of water and food along migrant trails. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through May of this year, the Pima County Medical Examiner reported finding the remains of 58 presumed border crossers in the deserts of Southern Arizona, bringing the total reported over the past two decades to roughly 3,000. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During his initial instructions to the jury, Collins pointedly said this case was ""not a referendum on immigration policy.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And prosecutor Nate Walters insisted the case shouldn't be seen as a judgment of humanitarian assistance to migrants in general: ""No More Deaths is not on trial,"" Walters said in his opening statement. ""Scott Warren is.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even the basic terms each side used -- ""illegal aliens"" vs. ""undocumented migrants"" -- reflected a divide. Over a week, the larger political context for Warren's actions proved inescapable. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Assistant US Attorney Anna Wright argued that, in Warren's alleged conspiracy, ""one goal was to thwart the Border Patrol at every possible turn.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Defense attorney Greg Kuykendall told jurors that ""there is no evidence in this case that Scott intended to violate the law. The evidence is the opposite"" -- that Warren simply wanted to prevent deaths.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During the trial, several founders of No More Deaths testified to their efforts to develop legal and medical protocols for the group's work, based on those of other humanitarian aid groups such as the International Red Cross. Andy Silverman, an emeritus professor of law at the University of Arizona who helped develop the protocols, said the group trained volunteers thoroughly, shared the protocols with the Border Patrol, and met regularly with the agency in part to ensure ""we do things in a proper and a legal way, we do things transparently.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Border Patrol declined to comment on meetings with No More Deaths or on the protocols, citing pending litigation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But another No More Deaths volunteer, Geena Jackson, said that the cooperation went only so far. ""I have seen Border Patrol agents dumping out gallons of water"" left for migrants, Jackson said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Prosecutors objected successfully several times when Warren's attorneys tried to show jurors photos or videos of migrants' remains, or to have witnesses describe them in detail. But when Warren took the stand in his own defense, Walters questioned him aggressively about a Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/28/i-gave-water-migrants-crossing-arizona-desert-they-charged-me-with-felony/?utm_term=.02423389b988"" target=""_blank"">opinion piece</a> Warren wrote just before the trial. Walters said it was misleading for Warren to say desert temperatures could reach 120 degrees when the two men Warren helped had crossed in the winter. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That opened the door for Kuykendall to have Warren read the entire piece to the jury on the stand, with the judge's permission. Warren was able to air his argument that the case might set a dangerous precedent, and that the Trump administration is expanding the definitions of ""transportation"" and ""harboring"" in ways that could criminalize not only humanitarian aid work but potentially the daily lives of millions of families in which one partner is undocumented and another is a citizen. If prosecutors had hoped to leave aside the context of the Trump administration's attempts to crack down on migrants, the reading of the op-ed brought that bigger picture back into the courtroom. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walters and Wright relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to argue that Warren conspired and hid the two men, who have since been deported. They cited phone records that showed Warren spoke to an immigration activist, Irineo Mujica, three times on January 11, one day before the two young men crossed the border from Mexico. Warren was the first person to show up at The Barn on January 14, the day that Mujica drove the two men there from a gas station in Ajo.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Gas station videos showed the two migrants could have had food and drinks the day they showed up, which prosecutors said suggested they weren't in medical distress and didn't need to stay at The Barn for days.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Border Patrol agents testified that they saw Warren pointing out landmarks as the men were getting ready to leave on January 17. Prosecutors suggested that he was helping them avoid a Border Patrol checkpoint.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Warren said he was helping orient the men so they would not get lost in the desert. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Jurors heard that Mujica, who was not indicted, was the founder of a migrant shelter in Sonoyta, Sonora, just south of the Arizona border. Mujica was arrested by Mexican federal police in Sonoyta on Wednesday for allegedly transporting migrants illegally, according to a press release from the Mexican government, though this was not mentioned at the trial. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Warren testified that he spoke with Mujica about recovering remains Mujica knew of in the desert, and about an upcoming visit by volunteers bringing supplies to the shelter. The defense showed jurors emails demonstrating that Warren was regularly in touch with Mujica about such matters.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a video shown to jurors by the prosecution, one of the two migrants, Kristian Perez-Villanueva, said Mujica told the two men to tell anyone who asked that ""we came by ourselves, alone, on our own."" After walking for two days through the desert, he said, they waited at the gas station to be picked up and driven to The Barn. Perez-Villanueva said that Mujica didn't tell them to ask for anyone, nor did he mention Warren, and that no one told them to hide or what to do if Border Patrol agents came to the house. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kuykendall, the defense attorney, said in his closing statement that the prosecution's idea of ""a far-flung conspiracy"" based on the evidence they put forth ""makes no sense.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Warren testified that in his volunteer work he always followed the law. ""How could you not do it,"" he said of his work helping migrants, ""living in a place where people are dying by the dozens around you every year. How could you not respond?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There was no suggestion by prosecutors that Warren benefited in any way from the alleged conspiracy. But Wright, the prosecutor, argued that Warren ""had an interest in furthering Kristian and Jose's illegal trip,"" and that his aim ""was the furtherance of the goals of his organization"" in helping people complete their journeys to the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the end, jurors could not agree on whether Warren was guilty of any of the charges.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Collins set a hearing for July 2. Prosecutors declined to say whether they would seek to retry Warren. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

He said Uber chose to partner with Heliflite, a New Jersey helicopter charter company, because of what he said was a strong safety record.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The crashes come at an inopportune time for Uber. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio questioned Monday the role the Federal Aviation Administration is playing in regulating heliports. And City Council Speaker Corey Johnson asked in a local television appearance if the flights Uber would be offering are necessary and safe.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Uber isn't the first company<strong> </strong>to operate a helicopter ride service in New York. Blade began offering continuous flights to JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport and Newark Airport earlier this year. It had already charted flights to the airports for several years. The Hudson River crash last month was a helicopter that a Blade partner, Zip Aviation, operates. According to a Blade spokesman, no Blade passengers were on-board as the crash happened during a refueling mission. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Fatal helicopter crashes are down from the mid-1980s, when there were nearly twice as many fatal crashes than there have been<strong> </strong>in recent years. There have been 18 fatal crashes and 35 deaths in the first five months of 2019, a rate similar to the previous year, according to FAA data. That's one fatal crash for every 143,000 hours of flight. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Aviation is more heavily regulated than motor vehicles, where Uber's traditional business operates. Allison said he views building flying cars as easier than developing self-driving cars on the ground, because there's so much open space in the air. But the challenging part, Allison said, is how highly regulated aviation is.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Uber held its conference in Washington, DC to better connect with regulators. Speaking at the event, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao stressed safety as an administration priority when it comes to flying vehicles. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Safety is always number one. it is the foundation of everything that the department does,"" Chao said. ""There are a lot of questions about these systems. What type of propulsion will be used? Where, how far and how fast will they fly?

What's more, two of the three were by unanimous votes and none made big headlines.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">But the term won't end this way. And much of the weight of this momentous session is on Roberts' shoulders.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This is the first time in Roberts' 14 years as chief justice that he will likely be the deciding vote on several final, tense cases -- a total of 24 over the next two weeks. Roberts landed in the ideological center of the court last year when Justice Anthony Kennedy retired after a three-decade tenure. And because Roberts has long been to the right of centrist conservative Kennedy, the court is primed to make a sharp conservative turn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last Friday, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/29/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-abortion/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>, the court's senior liberal, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-gerrymandering-census/index.html"" target=""_blank"">warned</a> of a spate of 5-4 rulings to come and said Kennedy's retirement would be ""of greatest consequence"" for pending cases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While close observers of the court have forecast that for nearly a year, such a prediction is of a different magnitude coming from a justice who has witnessed firsthand the court's private votes in its closed conference room. Ginsburg knows where the majority is headed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Two of the most politically charged cases awaiting resolution, testing 2020 census questions and partisan gerrymanders, could lead to decisions favoring Republican Party interests and reinforce the partisan character of a court comprising five GOP appointees and four Democratic ones.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That is a signal Roberts -- always insisting the court is a neutral actor -- does not want to send, despite past sentiment that would put him on the Republican side in both.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People need to know that we're not doing politics,"" he said in a February appearance at Belmont University in Nashville. ""They need to know that we're doing something different, that we're applying the law."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Conflicts over such interpretations of the law, and the churning environment of the nation's capital, are no doubt adding to protracted disagreements behind the scenes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among the most awaited cases are those testing whether the Trump administration may validly add a citizenship question to the 2020 census; whether judges will be allowed to curtail partisan gerrymanders that make it nearly impossible to unseat the controlling party in a state; and whether a 40-foot cross, a World War I memorial known as the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/02/27/politics/supreme-court-memorial-cross-church-and-state/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Peace Cross</a>, may remain on public land in Maryland.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Predictions at this stage can be fraught but based on oral arguments and other signs from the justices, the answer to all three questions may be yes. It is certain the nation is headed for more 5-4 rulings. It is also likely that the 64-year-old chief justice, concerned about the place of the high court in these volatile times, will try to neutralize any appearance of politics.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In June 2018, when Roberts wrote the five-justice decision upholding President Donald Trump's travel ban on nationals from certain majority-Muslim countries, he <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/sotomayor-roberts-trump-president-normal/index.html"" target=""_blank"">deferred to the executive</a> and insisted (over a dissent from the four liberals): ""This is an act that could have been taken by any other president.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/27/politics/sotomayor-roberts-trump-president-normal/index.html"" target=""_blank"">RELATED: Roberts treats Trump like a normal President.

Some cases defy that goal, sometimes because of the chief justice's own interest. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the dispute over a citizenship question on the census, Roberts appeared ready during April oral arguments to accept the government's assertion that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross wanted the question added to help the Department of Justice enforce the Voting Rights Act.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The state of New York and Democrat-dominated challengers reject those grounds as contrived and point to Census Bureau analyses that predict such a question would diminish the response rate from noncitizens and Hispanics. That could have consequences for political power and government money across the US. The decennial count is used to apportion seats in the US House and allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal and state funds.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since those April arguments, the American Civil Liberties Union and others that joined the legal challenge against the Trump administration said they had found new evidence that the Commerce Department was trying to help Republicans. They cited a newly disclosed 2015 study written by Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a Republican redistricting expert, that using only the citizen voting-age population for redistricting purposes would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Supreme Court has not responded to the revelation, which was relayed to the justices in a letter. But Roberts had made clear, during oral arguments, that he did believe the justices should consider material that was not part of the earlier lower court record in the case.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In public appearances, Roberts has downplayed his role at the helm of the nation's top court. ""There have been 17 chief justices, and I'd be very surprised if people in here could name"" them, he said at Belmont University. ""My point is that you're not guaranteed to play a significant role in the history of your country, and it's not necessarily a bad thing if you don't.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But now he is not only in the center chair, presiding. He is also positioned to decide the outcome of cases. It is not yet known how he will balance his institutional and ideological interests.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Supreme Court justices can be inscrutable, and on Monday, nothing in Roberts' nor his colleagues' courtroom demeanor revealed what to expect between June 17 (when the nine are scheduled to return to the bench) and the end of the month. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/ruth-bader-ginsburg-gerrymandering-census/index.html"" target=""_blank"">In her New York speech last Friday</a>, Ginsburg intimated that the court was about to drop a series of contentious decisions, and that the absence of Kennedy's steadying influence would be consequential.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ginsburg pointed to comparisons between the census dispute and last term's ""travel ban"" case.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She referred to the deference that the Roberts majority had shown the Trump administration in the latter and closed her discussion of the former with this observation: The challengers ""in the census case have argued that a ruling in Secretary Ross's favor would stretch deference beyond the breaking point.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What to read into Ginsburg's speech?

It determines how to divvy up congressional seats as well as the allocation of billions of dollars of federal funds.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At oral arguments in April, the justices <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/23/politics/supreme-court-census-question-oral-arguments/index.html"" target=""_blank"">appeared to be split</a> along their familiar ideological 5-4 conservative-liberal divide, although it's a risky endeavor to ascertain how a case will come out based solely on that brief public appearance.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If they followed their usual protocol, the justices met later in their stately conference room to discuss the case. Speaking in order of seniority, they each likely stated their initial vote. No one else is allowed in the room -- no clerks, no aides. If there is a knock on the door, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the junior-most justice, is tasked with responding. Soon after the initial vote, Chief Justice John Roberts, if he is in the majority, assigns the opinion or takes it for himself. If he is in the minority, the most senior member of the majority assigns the opinion.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although some are more technologically apt than others, they still communicate between chambers via paper. Sometimes that includes one justice encouraging a colleague to add or delete certain language so that the justice feels more comfortable joining the opinion, as with Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy in a landmark 2008 Second Amendment case, retired Justice John Paul Stevens told <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/john-paul-stevens-looks-back-on-nearly-a-century-of-life-and-law-but-worries-about-the-future/2019/05/11/494d5768-7332-11e9-9f06-5fc2ee80027a_story.html?utm_term=.9598a96107a2"" target=""_blank"">The Washington Post</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Most famously, Roberts switched his vote in 2012 after oral arguments in order to save the Affordable Care Act. After first voting to strike down the law, he decided to uphold it -- calling it a tax -- and worked with liberals Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer on a controversial final opinion, as <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/03/21/politics/john-roberts-obamacare-the-chief/index.html"" target=""_blank"">CNN's Joan Biskupic reported in ""The Chief.""</a> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The process means that nothing is ever set in stone until the court releases its opinion in public, and the challengers to the citizenship question likely hope that at least some of the justices might be interested in what is going on elsewhere in the legal system.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a dramatic turn, the American Civil Liberties Union has taken its new allegations back to the district court judge who initially heard the case in New York. The ACLU and a team of Arnold &amp; Porter lawyers are seeking sanctions against the Trump administration and alleging that officials gave misleading testimony about the genesis of the question. The group sent a six-page letter to the judge, as well as the Supreme Court, describing the material as ""damning new evidence"" that they say reveals ""hyper-partisan"" motives were at the root of the citizenship question. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The Justice Department's hands are not clean,"" <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-966/102059/20190605110541663_NYIC%20Respondents%20Letter%20Notice%20of%20Reply%20v2%20FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">the letter states</a>.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's almost certainly too late for these new allegations to impact the outcome of the decision the court is likely to hand down by the end of the month,"" said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""But it's hard to imagine that the justices who are inclined to side with the challengers won't see this as further proof of the strength of the challengers' claims -- and the wrongfulness of the government's conduct here,"" Vladeck said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a talk Monday before the Supreme Court Historical Society, Justice Clarence Thomas was asked if the justices ever trade votes from one case to the next. He responded sternly:<a href=""https://www.c-span.org/video/?461071-1/supreme-court-historical-society-annual-lecture-justice-clarence-thomas"" target=""_blank""> ""I don't horse trade.""</a> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But he said there are instances when the justices try to convince each other of their position after arguments.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Justice Kennedy was great at it,"" Thomas said.

Most critically, Furman said Ross' stated rationale for the question -- that the Justice Department said it was necessary for better enforcement of the Voting Rights Act -- was ""pretextual -- in other words that he announced his decision in a manner that concealed its true basis."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Administrative Procedure Act gives agencies broad discretion, but they must offer the actual reasons for their decisions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/doj-census-allegations/index.html"" target=""_blank"">RELATED: DOJ calls new census allegations a 'baseless attack on the integrity' of department and its employees</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case back in April , the conservatives on the court seemed ready to side with the Trump administration. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted at one point that ""the statute that Congress has passed gives huge discretion to the secretary how to fill out the form, what to put on the form."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But liberals such as Kagan pushed back on Ross' justification for adding the question, citing the fact that Ross deviated from the advice of some census officials.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The secretary needs reasons to do that, and I searched the record and I don't see any reason,"" Kagan said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You can't read this record without sensing that this -- this need is a contrived one,"" she added. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New information</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late last month, the ACLU obtained a hard drive with some 75,000 documents, including a 2015 study from a Republican redistricting expert, Dr. Thomas Hofeller, who they say played a significant role in the decision to add the question. Hofeller, who has since died, wrote that using ""citizen voting age"" population as the redistricting population base would be ""advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The challengers allege Hofeller also ghostwrote part of a draft Justice Department letter requesting that the Commerce Department, which oversees the census, add the question. They say that the evidence reveals that Ross adviser A. Mark Neuman and senior Justice official John Gore ""falsely testified"" about the genesis of the request to add the question. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a fiery letter to Furman on Monday, the Justice Department said that Hofeller's work did not play ""any role whatsoever"" in the department's request to add the question.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is no smoking gun here; only smoke and mirrors,"" the Justice Department said, adding that Gore's testimony was ""entirely truthful."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Substantively, the 'new' evidence is irrelevant because the critical"" issue in the case ""is whether (Ross) provided an objectively rational basis for his decision to reinstate the citizenship question,"" the department added.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg followed with 16%, 15% and 14% respectively. Rounding out the top five was California Sen. Kamala Harris at 7%; no other candidate polled above 2%. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">A look at polls taken at about this point in primary cycles since 1980 suggests that while Biden leads now, there's a pretty good chance he won't actually win the caucuses.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Assigning an exact chance to how polling this early translates to the eventual results is difficult because of the high number of candidates running and the traditional volatility of Iowa caucuses' polling. Only three eventual winners were polling at this point between 10% and 30% -- which is where the top four 2020 contenders in Iowa currently sit. Most have been above 30% (seven out of 14) or below 10% (four out of 14). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, there's a clear relationship between <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ldYajKK.png"" target=""_blank"">polling</a> at this point and the eventual Iowa caucuses' outcome. Using some <a href=""https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-logistic-regression/"" target=""_blank"">simple modeling</a>, we can capture some of this relationship to try and understand how frequently we should expect people polling at certain levels should go on to win. This model is meant as a first word, not the final word. It controls for where a candidate is polling and where the leader is polling, allowing us to make some rough assessments of what to expect.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's clear is there is no runaway favorite in this field. For candidates to have a 50% or greater chance of winning the caucuses at this point, my simple historical model suggests they should be polling at about 35% or greater. No candidate is close to that right now. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A frontrunner polling in Biden's position (in the mid 20s) should be expected to win the caucuses about 30% of the time, according to said simple historical model This is even true when attempting to control for past candidates with high name recognition like Biden. That 30% chance lines up fairly well with how often candidates <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-analyzed-40-years-of-primary-polls-even-early-on-theyre-fairly-predictive/"" target=""_blank"">polling nationally in the mid 20s</a> have gone on to win the nomination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Put in non-statistical talk: Biden's got the best shot of anyone to win the caucuses. But chances are someone else will win. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those polling at about 15%, with a polling leader in the mid 20s, should be expected to win the caucuses about 15% of the time. This means that there is a meaningful distinction between leading at around 24% and trailing in the mid 10s. In other words, we should take the 2020 polling at face value: Biden's probably in a bit of a better position than those below. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, we currently have three candidates polling at about 15% in Iowa. That means that, combined, there is probably a better chance that Buttigieg, Warren or Sanders will win the caucuses than Biden -- but we just don't know which one.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Someone in Harris' position (a little north of 5%) should be expected to win Iowa around 5% to 10% of the time. Republican Ted Cruz was at about 5% in the polls at this point four years ago, and Rick Santorum was in the same position back in 2011. Harris definitely has a better-than-zero shot of winning, though it's probably best to categorize her as a clear underdog at this point. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Perhaps most interesting is what past contests tell us about the group of candidates polling at 2% or lower. They suggest that someone polling at about 1% should go on to win the caucuses about 3% of the time. This isn't nothing, especially since we have more candidates than ever polling around this level. The chance that any one of these candidates joins the top tier of candidates at some point in the coming months is almost certainly higher than 3%.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, there is an example of a candidate polling at about 1% at this point in the cycle who has gone on to win the caucuses. Republican George H.W. Bush polled at 3% in May 1979 and 1% in August 1979 in the Des Moines Register poll. He would go on to shock the political world by winning the 1980 Iowa caucuses. (Of course, he didn't win the GOP nomination that time around.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Notably, all the examples of candidates polling at less than 10% at this point and going on to win the caucuses were Republican. But I'm not sure I would read much into that lack of Democrats coming from way back to win. We're dealing with a sample size of just seven on each side of the political aisle.

""It isn't meant as a commentary on any show, just our view that hard-hitting stories like the ones we are doing should stand on their own.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The night Baquet said that, Maddow pointedly had a guest from the Washington Post on her show instead.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">MSNBC hasn't said anything publicly since the initial reports in May, but the Times policy has caused consternation behind the scenes at the cable network. ""It's poorly executed and poorly thought through,"" one of the MSNBC staffers said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's absurd,"" said another.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The staffers spoke on condition of anonymity because they said public comments might inflame tensions further.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Both sides rely on each other: Cable networks like MSNBC lean heavily on guests from newspapers like The Times, and newspapers benefit from the television and social media exposure.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But editors at The Times are trying to be more consistent about ""enforcing our long-standing rules,"" as one source put it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Times declined to comment on the recent meeting or the current complaints from MSNBC staffers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Baquet previously explained his thinking to The Daily Beast this way: ""We will still appear on television when invited. It's the most sharply opinionated shows that give me pause. I'm not sure which shows we will avoid. The line is increasingly blurred. Again, this is not an assault on our television compatriots.

In this way, she is the polar opposite of her 9 p.m. rival Sean Hannity on Fox News, another one of the shows that would be subject to The Times' guidelines.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In practice, Times journalists are rarely if ever booked on Fox talk shows, so the guidelines have not come into play. But they are booked on CNN and MSNBC shows on a daily basis.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And ""it's hard to draw the lines,"" a person familiar with the matter acknowledged.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">MSNBC blurs the lines between news and liberal opinion in ways that conservative hosts on Fox frequently criticize.

The routine surveys measured how frequently people ate food in the four food categories defined by the <a href=""http://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf"" target=""_blank"">NOVA classification system</a>, which looks at how foods are made and not just nutrients.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The ""unprocessed or minimally processed"" food category included fruits, vegetables, legumes, milk, eggs, meats, poultry, fish and seafood, yogurt, grains (white rice and pasta) and natural juice. Salt, sugar, honey, olive oil, butter and lard were listed in the category of ""processed ingredients,"" while ""processed foods"" included cheeses, breads, beer, wine, cured traditional ham and bacon. The final category encompassed ultraprocessed foods such as flan, chorizo, sausages, mayonnaise, potato chips, pizza, cookies, chocolates and candies, artificially sweetened beverages and whisky, gin and rum.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Generally, products in this category are rich in poor quality fat, added sugar and salt, along with low vitamin density and fiber content, and they ""are economically profitable (low cost ingredients), very palatable and convenient,"" said Bes-Rastrollo.

It eventually grew to about 19,000 square miles; roughly twice the size of Vermont. Though polynyas are not unusual, this large and frequent of a hole was a great opportunity for scientists to figure out why, exactly, these holes were appearing. A team from the University of Washington explored the hole with a combination of robots, radio equipment and seals with antennas stuck to their heads.

In the area where the giant polynya opened up, there is an underwater mountain that, when met with strong storms, causes a swirl of sea water, churning saltier water from deeper parts of the ocean up to the top. Once that water is cooled, it falls to the bottom again, and the ice can't re-form. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As for the elephant seals, the team used them to transmit data back to shore as they swam in the depths of the polynya.

A show like ""Pose,"" with its LGBTQ cast (featuring <a href=""https://www.teenvogue.com/story/pose-transgender-actors"" target=""_blank"">more transgender actors</a> as series regulars than any scripted show in history), is an undeniable sign of progress. But it's also a reminder that too little has changed since the time period it depicts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Transgender women are still <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/transgender/index.html"" target=""_blank"">disproportionately impacted</a> by HIV/AIDS. Our community continues to face widespread <a href=""https://transequality.org/issues/employment"" target=""_blank"">employment discrimination</a>, poverty and harassment. ""Pose"" continues to tackle these topics with sensitivity in its new slate of episodes. But what makes this series so powerful is its unapologetic depiction of transgender joy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The loving looks between MJ Rodriguez's Blanca, who is the show's protagonist and mother figure, and Billy Porter's Pray Tell. The amusing antics of House of Ferocity co-mothers Candy (Angelica Ross) and Lulu (Hallie Sahar). The breathtaking beauty of Indya Moore's aptly named Angel, who has more love in her heart than the world will ever give to her. Porter in particular has been a breakout star, making fashion and political statements on the <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-48582277"" target=""_blank"">red carpet</a> at the Tonys, Oscars and Met Gala. All of these characters are back in the second season of ""Pose"" — and they still form the sweet beating heart of the show amid more serious subject matter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As the AIDS crisis surges, ""Pose"" swings back and forth between funerals and celebrations, protests and pleasures, abuses and absurdities. That might sound like tonal whiplash, but it's not. The series is actually an authentic portrayal of both the 1980s and 1990s social practice of forming ""Houses"" as alternative urban family structures and, more broadly, of LGBTQ resilience. When our community is under attack, we fight back, and we still find time to dance. (In this case, the stars of ""Pose"" are often dancing to Madonna's then-ubiquitous song ""Vogue,"" which introduced the aesthetics of ball culture to a more mainstream — and much whiter — audience.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The poignant mix of death and dance in ""Pose"" arrives at a timely moment. It has arguably never been more important for us to see transgender characters on TV finding happiness wherever they can against a backdrop of heartbreak. Five decades after the Stonewall riots, transgender American like me are still struggling to stay hopeful in the absence of formal legal protections and more widespread cultural acceptance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During its first few years in power, the Trump administration has <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/05/22/transgender-soldiers-against-trump-military-ban-pride-digi-prod.cnn"" target=""_blank"">imposed restrictions</a> on transgender military service,<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/02/22/politics/doj-withdraws-federal-protections-on-transgender-bathrooms-in-schools/index.html"" target=""_blank""> rolled back</a> Obama-era guidance for restroom use in schools, and <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/05/24/new-trump-administration-rule-would-weaken-protections-transgender-people-health-care/"" target=""_blank"">proposed a new rule</a> that could make it harder for my community to get medical care. Meanwhile, transgender people of color are being killed, with a <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/04/us/dallas-transgender-killings/index.html"" target=""_blank"">recent string of murders</a> in the Dallas area drawing attention (not nearly enough) to this horrific violence.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the second season premiere, Pray Tell pontificates over the House of Evangelista dinner table that ""every generation thinks that they're gonna be the ones that are finally invited to the party.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Put your glass slippers away Trans-arella,"" he concludes. ""It ain't never going to happen!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At this particularly challenging moment in LGBTQ history, transgender viewers like me have to wonder whether it's naïve to believe we could live to see the world that our forerunners envisioned in those riots in 1969 and underground balls in the 1980s and 1990s. How different are we, really, from these characters dreaming of a day that never came?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the potent lesson of ""Pose"" is that LGBTQ people can't wait for acceptance to live our lives, even in the face of death and discrimination. The transgender people I know are exhausted by <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/22/politics/transgender-trump-protection-rollback-trnd/index.html"" target=""_blank"">the current attacks</a>, afraid of future rollbacks, and worried that court decisions to come could endanger our rights further. Some are worried for their physical safety, their anxiety spiking with each homicide report.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And yet, much like the characters in ""Pose,"" we still find solace in community — in bars, at Pride parades, and, yes, by staying home and watching shows like ""Pose"" together. We have to care for each other the same way the House of Evangelista looks after their own: with acts of service and gentle touches. What gives me the most joy these days is the simplicity of seeing a smile on another transgender person's face.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Indeed, one of the reasons why ""Pose"" has earned such a devoted LGBTQ fan base is because the people behind the show — themselves LGBTQ, like producer Ryan Murphy and writer-director Janet Mock — understand that we don't just mope our way through hardship; we laugh as much as we cry, and sometimes simultaneously. No one can take away the beauty of that solidarity.

But the House resolution introduced last week did not include a criminal contempt citation against Barr -- it was only a resolution to go to court to enforce the subpoenas of Barr and McGahn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I see no need to resort to the criminal contempt statute to enforce our April 19 subpoena, at least for now, so long as the Department upholds its end of the bargain,"" Nadler said at a Monday hearing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""But our arrangement with the Department does not extend to the full scope of our request for the full Mueller report and its underlying materials, including grand jury information, nor does it extend to our demand that Don McGahn, a key fact witness, testify before this committee,"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec praised Nadler's decision.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We are pleased the Committee has agreed to set aside its contempt resolution and is returning to the traditional accommodation process,"" she said in a statement.

""John Dean's been a loser for many years,"" Trump said on Monday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the hearing Dean, who was a key witness in the Watergate case, evoked similarities between that case and Mueller's investigation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In many ways the Mueller report is to President Trump what the so-called Watergate road map, officially titled the grand jury report ... was to President Richard Nixon,"" Dean said. ""Stated a little differently, special counsel Mueller has provided this committee with a road map.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The hearing was the first in a series that the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees are planning to hold to highlight the Mueller report publicly. Dean noted at the outset he was ""not a fact witness,"" but argued he could provide a historical perspective.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Democrats walked Dean and the former prosecutors through the excerpts of the Mueller report, reading passages aloud and asking the witnesses -- who argued Trump should have been charged with obstruction of justice -- to weigh in.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The facts contained in that report would be sufficient to prove all of the elements necessary to charge multiple counts of obstruction of justice,"" said Joyce White Vance, a former US attorney in Alabama. ""The evidence is not equivocal, nor is the charging decision a close call. And I would be willing to personally indict the case, and to try the case. I would have confidence that the evidence would be sufficient to obtain a guilty verdict and to win on appeal.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Republicans questioned why a key witness from the Nixon era was speaking to them about the Mueller report, seizing on his statement that he was not a fact witness and noting that his long public record of commentary criticizing the President. Several Republicans noted that Dean was convicted during Watergate, comparing him to a witness the committee heard from earlier this year, the President's former lawyer Michael Cohen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What I really regret Mr. Dean is that you're here as a prop, you are functionally here as a prop, because they can't impeach President Trump because 70% of Democrats want something that 60% of Americans don't,"" said Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and close Trump ally.

The Justice Department responded it would also be willing to negotiate on the committee's document request so long as the House called off its contempt vote against Barr.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the Judiciary Committee still sees the resolution as part of the civil contempt process to enforce subpoenas through the courts, the Justice Department only considers it an effort to enforce subpoenas, and not contempt, according to a Justice Department official.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nadler noted that Tuesday's vote included language authorizing court action against McGahn, in addition to Barr. He said that as long as the Justice Department ""proceeds in good faith,"" there would be no further steps taken against Barr, but added: ""If important information is held back, then we will have no choice but to enforce our subpoena in court and consider other remedies.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rep.

They are largely wrong. In many cases, foreign leaders and citizens of the world alike have likely ""priced in"" Trump's erratic behavior and sidelined his pronouncements. If so, the result is a neutered presidency and an America that is safer because Trump is often not taken seriously.  </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">For decades, Presidents have played critical roles in international affairs -- from Richard Nixon's détente with China to Ronald Reagan's force of will that toppled communism to Jimmy Carter's brokered peace between Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin. In these and countless other examples, past Presidents advanced American interests and inspired the world by wielding both formal constitutional powers, as well as the authority granted by foreign leaders who accepted their statements as US policy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">This isn't the case with Trump, whose words foreign leaders can no longer take at face value. Fortunately, President Trump's incompetence in foreign relations, while not a cure-all, can moderate the damage that he might otherwise cause. The more exposure the world has to this President, the less he matters. After all, communication is a two-way street, and the audience plays a significant role in determining whether someone's words are accurate, meaningful, and safe to rely on.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Take, for example, Trump's rhetoric on North Korea. While the President recently said he is <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-27/trump-not-bothered-by-north-korea-s-recent-missile-test-launches"" target=""_blank"">not bothered by new North Korean missile tests</a> -- conflicting with the view of intelligence agencies -- he previously threatened nuclear attack (in his own way of course, by <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2018/01/03/trump-north-korea-nuclear-button-tweet-himes-reax-bts-ac.cnn"" target=""_blank"">claiming that his button is bigger than Kim's</a>).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In any prior administration, words such as these from the American President would place us at the precipice of war. But as norm-busting as they may be, we have become conditioned to view them as just the latest in an unbroken string of overheated comments. His words aren't newsworthy because they will all have real world consequences but because in many instances they won't -- despite being uttered by the leader of the free world, they are heavily discounted by the world just the same.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, how should foreign nations react if Trump renews his threats to pull out of NATO, makes further statements that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/16/politics/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-summit/index.html"" target=""_blank"">praise leaders of corrupt regimes</a>, such as Russia's Vladimir Putin, or makes some other jaw-dropping pronouncement? Unless these leaders haven't been paying attention, they should temper any initial alarm by weighing these statements against often-contradictory commentary from other senior American officials, the State Department and the CIA. His track record shows that impulsive words may not result in action. Ultimately, despite Trump's rhetoric, the US has not pulled out of NATO, and it has levied sanctions on Russia. Moreover, routine rebukes of Trump's comments from foreign leaders reveal an international band of adults who are ready to sideline the US President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, as oddly comforting as Trump's lack of global credibility may be, it reflects a sorry state of affairs. This administration has luckily not faced an acute national security crisis, such as a 9/11-style terrorist attack or an imminent threat of war. As has been the case throughout our history, when such circumstances arise, America needs a reliable and respected leader to guide the nation. And the way in which the President acts in moments such as these could determine the course of human history.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">President John F. Kennedy's approach to the Cuban missile crisis likely averted war. Conversely, President George W. Bush's fixation on weapons of mass destruction (which were never found) led to war with Iraq, resulting in the deaths of thousands of US service members and a power vacuum filled by al Qaeda, the group from which<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2014/08/08/world/isis-fast-facts/index.html"" target=""_blank""> ISIS</a> was later formed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If faced with a national security crisis, Trump's incompetence could pose serious problems. The void of US leadership could also damage the US' global standing and push fledgling nations, such as Libya, to take their cues from Russia and China rather than from the United States. And then there's Trump's command over the nuclear arsenal, which is scary, given his penchant for tantrums. In a crisis, it's hard to know where Trump's impulses would lead the nation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's more, there have been instances when President Trump's words have foretold real policy movements with real-world consequences, such as his use of tariffs as an international trade tool with China and his threats of tariffs on Mexican goods in an effort to advance immigration-related ends. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But recognizing that he can cause damage does not mean that every oddball comment he makes will have a lasting impact.

It is both my belief and continued hope that President Trump's journey to irrelevancy on the world stage advances by the tweet, continuing to take further root so that we will soon see the day when it will not only be reasonable for world leaders to ignore Trump but it will be the only rational thing for them to do.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the international stage, the one constant in modern history is that the American President is taken seriously.

In 2012, the government determined that cancers can be compensated as part of the fund.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It wasn't nearly enough money, however, and in 2015 Congress <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/06/15/2016-14259/james-zadroga-911-victim-compensation-fund-reauthorization-act"" target=""_blank"">added $4.6 billion in funding</a>, along with new controls and limits on some payments.

So did 42 senators. Their concerns were with the cost of the measure and how to pay for it. They ultimately agreed to a less generous version that became law. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The national debt and government spending were much bigger issues back in late 2010, when tea party furor helped Republicans end Democrats' House majority. Democrats regained control of the House this year. But even among Republicans, fear of government spending seems quaint after GOP lawmakers passed a tax bill in 2017 that is projected to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/09/news/economy/deficits/index.html"" target=""_blank"">explode the budget deficit</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New health problems</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The World Trade Center Health Program, the separate health care program related to the victims fund that's administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was made permanent in 2015. It has documented the troubling increase in illnesses, including cancer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In July of 2011, it had identified just more than 56,000 first responders, volunteers and others with health problems stemming from 9/11. By March of 2019, that number had risen to more than 95,000, with roughly 500 to 900 new cases being identified each month. The program has identified 2,355 deaths associated with 9/11-related health problems. That's nearly as many as died at the World Trade Center because of the crashes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Chronic and debilitating problems with sinuses, reflux and asthma are the most-diagnosed ailments, but as of May, more than 12,500 cases of cancer had also been diagnosed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As of May, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund had paid out 28,403 claims totaling $5.2 billion in the eight years since it reopened.

Ted Lieu and Michigan Republican Rep. Justin Amash, the joint resolution ""would reject all 22 sales the Administration is attempting to ram through under a phony emergency declaration,"" according to a statement released by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, a New York Democrat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In May, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally told lawmakers of the administration's plan to use a pre-existing rule that would allow it to expedite arms sales to allies in the Middle East. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The move drew bipartisan condemnation, with lawmakers decrying the precedent it sets, questioning the administration's claims of an emergency and raising the issue of Saudi Arabia's human rights record and the killing of journalist <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/20/politics/trump-saudi-arabia/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">House lawmakers reasserted that view Wednesday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The emergency declaration is nothing more than an egregious abuse of power by an Administration that doesn't like being told, 'No.' There is no emergency, but there is a conflict in Yemen that has killed thousands of civilians with US-made weapons and a Congress that is tired of being complicit,"" Lieu said in a statement. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The Trump Administration knows that these sales would not meet that standard, so they decided to declare a fake emergency in order to bypass Congress. It's a tactic they've used before. This legislation sends a strong signal that we will not tolerate the Trump Administration's blatant abuse of power,"" he added. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rhode Island Democratic Rep. David Cicilline also voiced his frustration over the administration's decision-making, specifically with regards to its policy on Saudi Arabia.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Aiding and abetting Saudi Arabia's horrific attacks on civilians in Yemen is unconscionable. We should demand better from countries that purport to be our allies,"" he said. ""The President is once again trying to circumvent the law to do something the American people oppose. Congress needs to step up and prevent this from happening.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Tensions on display</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The latest legislative rebuke against the Trump administration's emergency declaration came hours after State Department Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs R. Clarke Cooper was grilled by lawmakers on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cooper argued that an emergency declaration was necessary to not only address threats posed by Iran but also to send a message of support to US partners in the region. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""These sales and the associated emergency certification are intended to address the military need of our partners in the face of an urgent regional threat posed by Iran; promote the vitality of our bilateral relationships by reassuring our partners; and preserve strategic advantage against near-peer competitors,"" he testified.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But those comments were ill received by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who challenged Cooper's assertion that the emergency declaration was warranted. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""As I said last month, the recent use of this emergency authority in my judgment was unfortunate. Of note, some of these sales will not be ready for delivery for over a year. I would have preferred State to adhere to the formal statutory 30-day congressional review process to expedite these 22 arms sales, where a Resolution of Disapproval process could have been an option,"" the committee's top Republican Michael McCaul said in his opening remarks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, McCaul did note that he agreed with Cooper's concerns related to US allies looking to Russia and China to buy weapons, noting <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-intelligence-saudi-arabia-ballistic-missile-china/index.html"" target=""_blank"">CNN's recent reporting</a> that Saudi Arabia has expanded its ballistic missile program with help from Beijing as an example.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Last week, it was reported that Saudi Arabia, however, has been buying ballistic missiles from China. While we are not discussing ballistic missile technology today, it is disturbing if our allies are deepening their defense relationships with our adversaries like China,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Was Kushner involved?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In addition to voicing their opposition to the emergency declaration itself, House lawmakers sought to extract answers related to the administration's decision making process leading up to May's announcement and the involvement of President Donald Trump's son-in-law and White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Cooper, repeatedly declined to answer questions from Democratic Rep. Bill Keating about whether Kushner played any role in discussions with the Saudis about arms sales.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Was Jared Kushner, since you are in a position to know, in any way involved in this what so ever?"" Keating asked, referring to the events that ultimately culminated in the administration's emergency declaration.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What I can tell you ... Mr. Kushner does not have an interagency role in the review of these cases,"" Cooper answered, only conceding that Kushner was not specifically involved in constructing the declaration itself despite repeated questions about his overall coordination with Saudi officials. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kushner refused in a recent interview with Axios on HBO to discuss his private communications with the Crown Prince, with whom<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/08/middleeast/saudi-arabia-middle-east-arms-race-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> he is known to be close</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At one point during his testimony, Cooper appeared to argue that Congressional objections to certain proposed arms sales, namely those from top Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Democrat Bob Menendez, were to blame for delays in the approval process and factored into the administration's decision to declare an emergency.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Yes, the protracted process did contribute to the conditions that necessitated an emergency,"" Cooper said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Menendez responded to Cooper's comments in a statement to CNN saying: ""Disdain for law and process is not an excuse to break it.  It's also not an excuse to create a fake emergency, mislead Congress, and rush weapons into Saudi hands without assurances that they won't be used to kill civilians.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Juan Pachon, a spokesman for Menendez, also pushed back against Cooper's claim, saying the Senator ""was waiting for the Secretary of State and the State Department to answer his human rights concerns regarding both sales, but there has been no engagement on substance since Jamal Khashoggi was brutally murdered by the Saudis.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Clearly, the Secretary of State decided that he couldn't answer those concerns substantively or persuasively, and so concocted an emergency so he wouldn't have to do so. You have to give Mr. Cooper points for creativity in how he tried to defend the indefensible,"" Pachon added. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""There's a high probability we'll be paying less than $2.50 in the next few months.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The national average price will probably decline even more — perhaps to $2.25 a gallon according to Kloza — later in the year. Once the summer driving season ends, demand for gas falls, pushing down prices. So does a switch away from the more expensive blend of gasoline required in the summer months to control smog.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A national average of $2.25 a gallon would probably mean that nearly half the nation's gas stations will be selling regular gas for less than $2 a gallon, Kloza said.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

PFAS is short for perfluoroalky and polyfluoroalkyl substances and includes chemicals known as PFOS, PFOA and GenX, sometimes called forever chemicals. These chemicals all share signature elemental bonds of fluorine and carbon, which are extremely strong and difficult to break down in the environment or in our bodies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">These chemicals can easily migrate into the air, dust, food, soil and water and can accumulate in the body. They've been linked to adverse health impacts including liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, high cholesterol, obesity, hormone suppression and cancer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the body, PFAS chemicals primarily <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-12/documents/ffrrofactsheet_contaminants_pfos_pfoa_11-20-17_508_0.pdf"" target=""_blank"">settle </a>into the blood, kidney and liver. A <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072821/"" target=""_blank"">study </a>from 2007 by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that PFAS chemicals could be detected in the blood of 98% of the US population.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>FDA reveals PFAS findings</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">PFAS chemicals have been used by various industries because of their ability to repel oil and water. They've been manufactured since the 1940s and can be found in non-stick products, stains, paints, cleaning products, food packaging and firefighting foams.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The results of the FDA investigation were initially presented by the agency at the 29th annual European meeting of the <a href=""https://helsinki.setac.org/programme/scientific-programme/trackssessions/"" target=""_blank"">Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry </a>in Helsinki last month.

All 13 samples had detectable levels of PFAS that were of similar chemical structure as what was used in firefighting foams. The FDA said the samples were ""determined to be a human health concern and all milk from the farm was discarded."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The FDA noted that even after the cows are no longer exposed to the PFAS contaminated water or feed, the accumulated chemicals can remain in the cow. Just 30 days of eating and drinking contaminated food and water would require 1.5 years for a cow to rid their system of the chemicals. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The FDA also analyzed produce samples from farms close to a PFAS manufacturing plant. The produce was sold at local farmer's markets. According to the FDA, area water wells are known to be contaminated with the PFAS known as GenX. Of the 20 produce samples tested, 16 were leafy greens such as lettuce, cabbage, kale and collard greens. Among those, 15 showed detectable levels of PFAS.

""I couldn't believe that those were my legs.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A bullet had entered her right leg above the knee and shattered her femur. A second one hit her left thigh and left a flesh wound. She would need two months of intense physical therapy before she could walk without assistance, and would have a bad limp for close to a year. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heavy sedation kept Carter's physical pain at bay for a while. But it couldn't stop the grief. Or the guilt. When a hospital nurse discovered Carter watching the news in the middle of the night, she gave her a small journal and told her to start writing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>The guilt of feeling grateful to be alive is heavy.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>Wanting to smile about surviving,</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>but not sure if the people around you are ready.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>As the world mourns the people killed and viciously slain,</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>I feel guilty about screaming about my legs in pain because I can feel nothing,</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>like the other 49 who weren't so lucky to feel the pain of mine.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Carter kept going over the shooting in her head. Unlike some survivors, her mind hadn't defensively blocked the details.

And the gunman coming in.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She remembered the last time she saw Akyra conscious, on the phone with her mom. Bleeding. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Saying, ""I don't want to die.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the hospital, Carter struggled to even be in the same room with Akyra's little sister.

Another 53 were injured. It was the deadliest mass shooting by a single person in modern US history. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/us/las-vegas-massacre-fbi-investigation-ends/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Until it wasn't</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the three years since Pulse, eight of the deadliest mass shootings in the US have occurred.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The number of survivors -- from those who were at the scene, to the family and friends left grieving -- is nearly impossible to quantify. In the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting, cameras swarm and interest is intense. But as years pass, survivors see their stories told less often. Politicians' promises dwindle. The general public moves on, even if they can't. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The aftermath of trauma</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">These days Carter tries not to think about the shooter at all. She believes in God, and though she doesn't understand why He allowed this to happen, she tries to trust that there's some greater purpose to all this pain.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I have to hang on to that hope,"" she says. ""Even if I'm wrong... with the increase in random acts of violence, the increase in terrorist attacks, increase in mass shootings. If I die and the world is still that horrible, at least I didn't have to live with that fear.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It's taken her a long time to get to this place of acceptance. After the shooting she was just mad. Mad that she couldn't go the bathroom by herself. Mad that she and her friends had chosen Pulse in the first place. Mad that Akyra wasn't still here. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Conspiracy theorists took their own emotional toll. Ugly and evil: These are the words Carter uses to describe the people who lied to the world in the days and weeks after the shooting -- saying Carter had never been shot; that she was a crisis actor. She spent hours fighting them online before she realized she was never going to win. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, when she finds herself complaining about the small things, she reminds herself that she could be paralyzed. Or dead. Her fiancé helps. She and Alex, Akyra's older brother, became close after the shooting. His strength and compassion lifted Carter up on her darkest days. He proposed in March 2018 at a Miami Heat game, and they're getting married in August. If there's one thing the shooting has taught Carter, it's that having your family around matters.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She's writing a book called ""Survive Then Live: The Patience Carter Story"" and became e a certified trauma professional so she can help others through post-traumatic stress. Her leg still hurts, every day, but her Instagram is full of motivational messages and photos from the gym. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to leave behind a legacy that people can talk to their kids about. You know I want them to be able to say ... This girl, she went through things that were horrible but she still persevered,"" she says.

However, the early varieties of cannabis, as well as most wild populations, had low levels of THC and other compounds with psychoactive properties, the authors said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many historians had placed the origins of cannabis smoking on the ancient Central Asian steppes, but these arguments relied solely on a passage from a single text from the late first millennium BC, written by the Greek historian Herodotus. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The authors said this study offers the first concrete evidence for cannabis smoking in this area, although it is still unclear whether the people buried at Jirzankal cemetery actively cultivated cannabis or simply sought out higher THC-producing plants.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Finding evidence for ancient drug use is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack, because this kind of evidence is rare due to there being few opportunities for long-term preservation of the remains of activities involving drug use, which is very ephemeral, and doesn't necessarily leave a lot in the way of physical evidence,"" Boivun said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The authors said that cannabis plants produce greater quantities of active compounds when they grow at higher elevations, and this may be why more potent plants had been discovered --  and a new use initiated -- by people living in high mountainous regions like the Pamirs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although the region is remote today, it may once have sat on the Silk Road, a key trade route. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Our study implies that knowledge of cannabis smoking and specific high-chemical-producing varieties of the cannabis plant were among the cultural traditions that spread along these exchange routes,"" Robert Spengler, the lead archaeobotanist for the study who is also at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, said in a statement.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Modern perspectives on cannabis vary tremendously cross-culturally, but it is clear that the plant has a long history of human use, medicinally, ritually, and recreationally, over countless millennia,"" Spengler added. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

A year earlier, when Adetu was a junior, she and her parents filed a claim with the DC Office of Human Rights, alleging discrimination and retaliation largely related to her math classes.

Sidwell had described the Adetus' claim as ""generalized gripes founded upon [the Adetus'] speculation"" and argued that it was entitled to academic deference, the appeals court noted.

Those arrested include two SAT/ACT administrators, one exam proctor, nine coaches at elite schools, one college administrator and 33 parents, according to Lelling.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here's how the plan worked, according to prosecutors.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Cheating on the ACTs and SATs</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, students who score higher on standardized tests such as the ACT and SAT are more likely to get into selective colleges. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Given that, Singer facilitated cheating on those exams for students whose wealthy parents paid for his services. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Singer pleaded guilty in court on Tuesday to four federal charges and admitted that the case against him was accurate.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the indictment, he arranged for a third-party -- generally Mark Riddell, who is <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/file/1142891/download"" target=""_blank"">charged with two conspiracy counts</a> -- to secretly take the test in the students' place or replace their responses with his own.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How did Riddell allegedly take the tests without being noticed by the test administrators?

She was arrested without incident at her home, the FBI said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She is accused of paying $15,000 to Singer's fake charity to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs, the complaint says.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A cooperating witness told authorities he purportedly traveled from Tampa to a West Hollywood test center to administer Huffman's daughter's exam. She received a 1420 on her test, which was 400 points higher than a PSAT taken a year earlier without the same administrator, the complaint states.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Huffman discussed the alleged scheme in a recorded phone call with Singer, the complaint says.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Bribing coaches for spots</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">College coaches do not explicitly decide who gets accepted into their university. But they do recommend to the admissions office certain recruited athletes to be accepted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Being a recruited athlete in a Division I sport is a ""very powerful influencer"" in the admissions process, said Sara Harberson, a college admissions expert and former dean of admissions at Franklin &amp; Marshall College.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because of that, a second part of Singer's scheme was to bribe college coaches and athletics officials.

CNN has reached out to Heinel for comment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>False charitable donations</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As part of the scheme, Singer disguised the bribe payments from clients as charitable contributions to the Key Worldwide Foundation, or KWF, a nonprofit that Singer set up as a charity, prosecutors said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But rather than go to charity, some of that money was instead used to bribe coaches and athletics officials as part of the scheme, prosecutors said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Singer's foundation purported to be a charitable organization, but was actually a front Singer used to launder the money that parents paid him,"" said Lelling, the federal prosecutor in Boston.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Afterward, a KWF employee would mail letters to the clients thanking them for their donations.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Your generosity will allow us to move forward with our plans to provide educational and self-enrichment programs to disadvantaged youth,"" the letter said, according to prosecutors. The letters also falsely wrote that ""no good or services were exchanged"" for the donations, prosecutors said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The alleged false nature of the charity is evident in a recorded phone call on October 25, 2018, between Singer and Giannulli that is included in the complaint.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Singer, acting at the direction of law enforcement officials, clarified with Giannulli that the money they sent was in fact used to get the daughters into USC for crew, and Giannulli allegedly agreed.

I knew from experience to expect blowback, but I was shocked by the intensity of my classmates' reaction. Many called me a traitor.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">I relate this experience as context for explaining one of the most puzzling paradoxes of our time. Students, faculty and alumni of elite universities are among the most liberal people in American society and yet, many of my classmates continue to stand behind indefensible admissions practices.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">For let's be clear: the college admissions process is a moral outrage. The colleges implicated in the Varsity Blues scandal have tried to dismiss the defendants as corrupt outliers. In truth, the college admissions scam is a public manifestation of a deeper, structural flaw -- the surface lesions that betray an underlying cancer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The fraud is a foreseeable consequence of a system that invites the infection of money. What stands out most about <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/13/us/felicity-huffman-monday-plea/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Felicity Huffman </a>and her co-defendants is their clumsiness. There are many legal pathways to buy your kids' way into college or to at least give them a substantial edge.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The influence of money is sanitized in the admissions process through the concept of legacy -- a massive racket carried out in plain sight. At Harvard in particular, the picture is getting worse, not better. Among members of the Class of 2018, 26.9% had a relative who'd attended Harvard. For the Class of 2022, that statistic increased to 36.8%, according to the<a href=""https://features.thecrimson.com/2018/freshman-survey/makeup/"" target=""_blank""> Harvard Crimson's survey of college freshmen. </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The direct consequence of legacy is to compromise the admissions process by admitting less qualified students. The indirect consequences are more profound and pernicious. Legacy admissions aren't in tension with the principles of the university; they are antithetical to it. Its taint is so corrosive and pervasive that it obscures the many virtuous things that universities do.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For example, legacy undermines universities' defense of affirmative action. <a href=""https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/02/final-arguments-in-admissions-suit-against-harvard/"" target=""_blank"">In the pending lawsuit </a>brought by a group of unsuccessful Asian-American applicants, Harvard has claimed that departing from meritocratic principles is necessary to promote diversity. This is superficially reasonable, as many ethical positions on affirmative action are. But no one could defend departing from merit to give an additional advantage to the children of alumni, who are disproportionately rich and white.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Legacy similarly undermines universities' position on big-time sports. Colleges exploit basketball and football players, disproportionately men of color who are effectively unpaid professionals, to generate millions of dollars. It would be one thing if these profits were used to fund an engine of social mobility. It's quite another if they <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/us-sport/college-sports-industry-exploitation-amateurism-ncaa-a8579606.html"" target=""_blank"">perpetuate a system</a> that reinforces inequality.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Legacy is the argument of an ethical dinosaur. Moreover, it's the simplest thing in the world to stop: Build a metaphorical wall between admissions and fundraising. My classmates and alumni at other colleges know this is the answer to the problem. So what prevents change? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Well, for starters, reunions. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, most alumni are inclined to view their alma mater as an ethical actor. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The culprit is the ""<a href=""https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-affect-heuristic-2795028"" target=""_blank"">affect heuristic</a>,"" a mental shortcut that leads people to make quick judgments, without seeking information, based on their association with a stimulus. It's why organizations -- universities included -- invest so heavily in marketing. Brand loyalty is a strong force, especially to colleges, and schools carefully exploit it in constructing their public narratives about admissions.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Case in point: When grilled at trial in the lawsuit over Asian-American admissions about the ""Dean's Interest List,"" a confidential list of applicants with ties to big donors whose admission rate is higher even than legacy applicants, Harvard's dean of admissions, William Fitzsimmons, <a href=""https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/22/fitzsimmons-faces-personal-reckoning/"" target=""_blank"">called the list</a> ""important for the long-term strength of the institution."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Earlier, during a deposition, <a href=""https://samv91khoyt2i553a2t1s05i-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Doc-416-1-Kahlenberg-Expert-Report.pdf"" target=""_blank"">he described legacy</a> as ""essential to Harvard's well-being.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Fitzsimmons couldn't point to a shred of data to support these claims. In any case, the colleges don't need the money. The eight Ivy League schools <a href=""https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=73"" target=""_blank"">have a combined endowment </a>of more than $100 billion,  which they retain from their wealthy alumni in part because of the massive tax break they receive as nonprofits, a status that seemingly only can be defended on the premise that they promote class mobility.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, private colleges do precious little to combat inequality.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since 1980, the CUNY system, in which I teach, <a href=""http://www2.cuny.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/page-assets/news/newswire/assets/Americas-Great-Working-Class-Colleges.pdf"" target=""_blank"">has promoted six times as many</a> poor students into the top three income quintiles as all the Ivy League schools combined. And since I wrote <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/end-college-legacy-preferences.html"" target=""_blank"">my first anti-legacy op-ed</a>, Harvard has been losing ground. Over the past five years, the percentage of entering Harvard students who come from a family making over $500,000 per year has increased from 13.8 to 17, according to the<a href=""https://features.thecrimson.com/2018/freshman-survey/makeup/"" target=""_blank""> Crimson survey of freshmen</a>.  Meanwhile, the share of students from families earning less than $40,000 per year is essentially unchanged.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To qualify for a federal Pell grant, a student needs to come from a family earning less than $50,000 annually. At Amherst, for example, 22% of undergraduates <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/05/25/sunday-review/opinion-pell-table.html"" target=""_blank"">receive Pell grants.</a> At my school, John Jay College of Criminal Justice,<a href=""https://datausa.io/profile/university/cuny-john-jay-college-of-criminal-justice/"" target=""_blank""> the figure is 64%</a>. Twenty-three percent of our students <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/john-jay-college-of-criminal-justice"" target=""_blank"">come from families making less than $20,000 annually.   </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For God's sake, if you're a billionaire contemplating a major gift to a private college, please give the money to a place like CUNY instead.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alumni who accept private colleges' defense of legacy and aggressive fundraising as necessary to the survival of a pro-social institution are being blindly loyal to a fight song and the colors of a uniform. That blind loyalty is the most formidable barrier to change. Universities won't change their practices until alumni stop contributing money and, yes, stop attending reunions.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So I'm saying in the most public way possible that I'll be boycotting my 30th reunion this weekend -- not as an act of disloyalty, but rather as an expression of love for equality of access -- the true, first principle of ethical higher education.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

In that interview, Conway also addressed those who said she was being too political. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Anytime I express a feeling about a candidate, people who want to make themselves relevant get air time and Twitter time, so I won't go there,"" <a href=""http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1712/06/nday.04.html"" target=""_blank"">she said</a>. Chris Cuomo, one of the ""New Day"" anchors, warned Conway that she needed to ""be careful about the Hatch Act.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She didn't seem to heed that advice. Which may not matter all that much, honestly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here's why: Although the Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency overseen by a Trump appointee, it has zero enforcement power. (The OSC is different than the special counsel's office, which sits under the Justice Department.) The OSC can make recommendations -- like that Conway should be terminated -- but it can't make that firing happen. And there's roughly a 0% chance Trump or his White House will do that. (White House spokesman Steven Groves called the OSC opinion<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/kellyanne-conway-office-of-special-counsel-hatch-act/index.html"" target=""_blank""> ""deeply flawed.""</a>)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But just because Conway isn't going anywhere doesn't mean this ruling from the Office of Special Counsel isn't revealing. Because it is. It's a window into how all lines are blurred in Trump's White House and how political calculation drives all the decisions that get made.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Let's start with that second part first. To be clear: The Trump White House isn't the first one to have political people -- like Conway, a former pollster and his winning 2016 campaign manager -- in it. Barack Obama had <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122420254658343011"" target=""_blank"">David Axelrod and David Plouffe</a> -- two leading campaign officials -- in his administration. George W. Bush installed <a href=""https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5481603"" target=""_blank"">Karl Rove</a>, his personal political Svengali, in the White House. And on and on it goes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's different about Trump -- and Conway -- is that this is a President who has been running for a second term, openly and actively, since almost the second he was sworn in as president. (On the day Trump was inaugurated, <a href=""https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/donald-trump-president-campaign-money-fundraising/"" target=""_blank"">he formed his 2020 reelection campaign</a>.) Through March 2019, Trump had already <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/2020-map-donald-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">raised $97 million</a> for his 2020 race. He is expected to formally kick off his 2020 bid next week in Florida. And on and on it goes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In short: Most presidents are political. They just have done their best to start the political part of the job as late as possible in their first term. Trump has always seemed to relish the purely political parts of the job, and so started doing them sooner than any president in modern history. That sets a tone for those who work for him -- including Conway.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And that traditional separation of politics and official government work has been further blurred by the fact that Trump has destroyed all lines of ""how things work"" in official Washington since arriving here in early 2017. He has <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/barr-doj-investiation-fbi-russia/index.html"" target=""_blank"">scolded the Justice Department</a> openly for not investigating what he thinks should be investigated. He has asked the White House counsel <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/mcgahn-trump-obstruction.html"" target=""_blank"">to say publicly</a> that Trump never instructed him to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.

Conway thumbing her nose at the Hatch Act is all of a piece with that broader theory that the old rules of Washington don't mean anything in the new Trump order.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

If I thought there was something wrong, I'd go maybe to the FBI, if I thought there was something wrong,"" the President said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Then again, Trump had said moments earlier: ""I don't think in my whole life I've ever called the FBI.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the morning after his interview broke the President launched a sometimes <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1139161442437992448"" target=""_blank"">nonsensical</a> Twitter tear, apparently seeking to fog understanding of his remark and to offer his defenders ammunition to push back against his critics.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The fact is that the phony Witch Hunt is a giant scam where Democrats ... and other really bad people, SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!"" the President wrote in one tweet.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>New calls for impeachment</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The immediate political effect of Trump's interview was to fan more Democratic calls for the President's impeachment -- and to make House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's life more difficult. ""It is past sad. It is past frustration. This is criminal. It is criminal. And we need to hold this president accountable,"" Democratic Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Michigan, told CNN's Erin Burnett.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I feel we have to begin that process,"" said Lawrence, one of a growing minority of Democratic House members urging more robust action against Trump, referring to impeachment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It would not be farfetched to argue that the President's remarks in themselves might end up as part of an impeachment case if things ever get that far.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Democratic Party's 2020 presidential candidates competed with one another to hit the impeachment talking point -- suggesting the growing power of the argument even though the Russia investigation is not a dominant 2020 issue.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The #MuellerReport made it clear: A foreign government attacked our 2016 elections to support Trump, Trump welcomed that help, and Trump obstructed the investigation,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, tweeted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he was not shocked since he believed that Trump does not respect the Constitution.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I believe the House should begin impeachment inquiries,"" Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Sen. Kamala Harris of California -- the state's former attorney general -- tweeted: ""China is listening. Russia is listening. North Korea is listening. Let's speak the truth: this president is a national security threat.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Anything it takes</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the political consequences of Trump's statements on Wednesday may pale in comparison with the intelligence and national security problems they will seed.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President did not just risk the integrity of the 2020 vote, he reinforced the already strong impression that he would do anything it takes -- anything -- to win. Since he has the power of the presidency, that's a troubling thought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Given that reality, any foreign entity that helps him in 2020 might expect all kinds of unspecified accommodations in policy or otherwise -- one reason why Trump's private meetings with Putin so trouble his opponents.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If he takes dirt from a foreign power, the President could then place himself in a dangerous, compromised position.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While US intelligence agencies -- and even the White House -- say they are doing everything they can to protect the election, the most powerful man in the world is signaling he doesn't care and would be willing to undermine those efforts.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And it may not even matter if any dirt gleaned on his opponents is true, since the Russian effort in 2016 showed that rumor and misinformation can be just as powerful as genuine information.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's swipe at Wray will also spark new speculation about the position of the President's second FBI director.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There was no immediate comment from the bureau.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>But will it even matter?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The lesson of Trump's two-plus years in power is that convention-shattering comments like these will do nothing to crumble the rigid GOP base of support that sustains his presidency.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the evidence of past kerfuffles, Republican senators can be expected to dodge and hedge. Conservative pundits will deny he did anything wrong. And his White House may accuse journalists of taking him out of context or deny the evidence on tape that the President said it at all.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every Trump-engineered outrage ends the same way, with his critics fulminating and the President untouched and unrepentant, reinforcing his brand as a flamethrower torching the structures of Washington governance, as he promised his fans he would.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump knows what he's doing. He makes such incendiary statements well aware that they will unleash a media storm that will explode heads in Washington, further divide the nation and agitate the political base he needs to turn out in droves in 2020.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By now, it's almost as if Trump is intent on demonstrating that in the turbulent political era he spawned there are no enforceable standards of minimally acceptable public conduct. That his power cannot be constrained and reality is what he says it is. Yet another presidential constraint obliterated, and a new outrage will be along soon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The cost to democracy</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That is not to say there will not be reverberations from the President's interview. In the real world, there will be political, practical and intelligence implications.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After all, he's inviting anyone to play in the process that ultimately underscores American democracy. If elections have no integrity, the public's faith in those to whom it grants power cannot be guaranteed and the system will be in severe jeopardy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's comments represented a particular repudiation of special counsel Robert Mueller, who even in his taciturn way made an impassioned plea for Americans to protect their democracy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/full-mueller-report-pdf/index.html"" target=""_blank"">first page of the Mueller report</a>, the special counsel writes that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in ""a sweeping and systematic fashion.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the end of his news conference last month, Mueller strove  again to get his message across with the final act of his assignment: ""There were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. And that allegation deserves the attention of every American.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump delivered his response on Wednesday, taking issue with the central pillar of Mueller's case -- effectively arguing that the targeting of an opponent by a foreign espionage operation is acceptable.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's called oppo research,"" Trump told ABC.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Adding insult to injury, the President also flagrantly misrepresented Mueller's account of multiple meetings between his team and Russians in the 2016 campaign: ""In fact, it said we actually rebuffed your friends from Russia; that we actually pushed them back -- we rebuffed them.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mueller did not find a conspiracy between the Trump team and Russia. But he wrote in the report that ""the campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The ultimate question posed by the special counsel's parting warning and Trump's response is whether Mueller's plea will resonate, or whether another presidential restraint will dissolve in plain sight.  </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Trump knows something about trying to keep things quiet. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to his now-imprisoned former fixer and lawyer, Michael Cohen, Trump OK'd and orchestrated payments to silence women who said they had affairs with him.

Trump said in the ABC interview that he was OK with ""oppo research,"" but how would he know how a foreign government got the oppo research? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Further, by saying he'd take the oppo research, he could be encouraging foreign governments to ferret it out.

He took that meeting after a publicist named Rob Goldstone said in an email that he could facilitate information via the pop star son of a Russian billionaire that was damaging to Clinton.

It's called oppo research.</em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The are many issues with Trump's argument, and several of them have to do with his own situation and philosophy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Trump's supposed to be a nationalist</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump describes himself as a nationalist. His first thought, he says, is to put what's best for the country first. But in this case, he's saying it's OK to work with a foreign government, or at least accept information from a foreign government, that would hurt a US politician.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Trump says there was no collusion</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President has spent the last two years swearing up and down there was<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/specials/politics/trump-russia-ties"" target=""_blank""> ""NO COLLUSION!""</a> between his campaign and Russia. And he claimed vindication when the Mueller report did not identify enough information to pursue criminal charges. However, it's now clear that Trump is perfectly OK working with a foreign power against his opponents.

What's less up for argument is that Sanders fundamentally changed the job of White House press secretary during her 23 months in the role. And not for the better.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sanders replaced Sean Spicer in the job way back in July 2017. Spicer's tenure was, uh, rocky -- and for one very clear reason: He simply could not balance the desires of a President who demanded favorable coverage and a White House press corps committed to abiding by facts and not the spin provided by the administration. (Case in point: Spicer's fact-free assertion that more people attended Trump's inauguration than any other in history.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What Sanders realized from the very start is that balancing between Trump and the media (and, by extension, the broader American public) wouldn't work. The way to stay in the job was to keep the President happy. Period.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So that's what she did. The President wasn't a fan of the daily press briefing. So, Sanders stopped doing it altogether. (On the day Trump announced she was leaving, Sanders <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/media/legacy-of-sarah-sanders/index.html"" target=""_blank"">hadn't done a daily press briefing in 94 straight days</a>.) Trump didn't like admitting he, or anyone in his administration, had ever said something that was later proven to be false. So Sanders simply parroted the falsehoods pumped into the bloodstream by her boss. And on and on it went. Whatever Trump wanted, Sanders did.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It's very hard to describe how radical a shift that approach is -- for a job that had long been regarded as part partisan and part public trust. Spicer was not a good fit as press secretary. That's beyond reasonable doubt. But even he sought to find ways to work with reporters and get as much accurate information as he could out to the public. He gave it the old college try -- in the spirit of Mike McCurry, Dana Perino, Ari Fleischer and many others who have held the press secretary job in this modern era of cable TV and social media. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's not to say all of those people had a warm and fuzzy relationship with the media -- or vice versa. That's not the job. It is to say, however, that all of those people tried to balance the public's right to know with their boss's policy and political interests. They failed at times. In some cases, often. But they also believed that a fundamental truth to the job was that they had two bosses: The President and the American public (as channeled through the White House press corps).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sanders never even feigned a commitment to that two bosses idea. She served the President and no one else.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong><u>The Point</u></strong><strong>: Sanders leaves the White House on great terms with her boss -- Trump pushed the idea of her running for governor of her home state of Arkansas when announcing her departure -- but with a legacy that will be rooted in an abandonment of a long-held core principle of who the White House press secretary actually works for.</strong></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

three Democrats -- Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam, a candidate whose campaign has struggled to gain any traction -- on the outside looking in at the first debates on June 26 and 27 in Miami.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/21/politics/2020-democrats-running-for-president/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Candidates</a> had until 11 a.m. ET to certify with the DNC that they have either achieved at least 1% support in three polls from an approved list of pollsters or received campaign contributions from 65,000 unique donors, including 200 donors each from 20 different states. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Based on public information, it had been clear for days that Bullock, Moulton and Messam were the three candidates likely to miss the debate stage.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And both Bullock and Moulton's campaigns have been resigned that they will not make the first debate.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""No, I'm not going to make the first debate, but I knew that getting in so late,"" Moulton told Hugh Hewitt earlier this month.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bullock said he was ""disappointed"" that he was likely to miss the first DNC debate, but said he is ""going to keep doing what I'm doing"" whether he makes the stage or not.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We'll still have plans. We'll be meeting voters and if not on that, we'll be doing the things yet,"" he said. ""But, yeah, I'm disappointed."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What remains in question is how the qualifying candidates will be dispersed over the two nights. NBC, the Democratic committee's media partner for the first debate, will make that announcement on Friday, sources tell CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NBC will divide the 20 Democrats vying to take on President Donald Trump into two groups: those with a polling average at 2% or higher and those whose polling average is under 2%.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NBC, according to a DNC aide, will then do a random selection, dividing up the top tier and lower tier into the two nights to ensure an even mix of candidates on each debate stage. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Four sources say the drawing will take place on Friday at Rockefeller Center in New York. Representatives of each of the campaigns that qualified will be allowed to have someone there.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Which candidates end up on the same stage will determine a great deal about the tone and tenor of each debate. Candidates, as the debates loomed, have already signaled a willingness to go after each other on a host of issues, with some of the barbs getting more and more direct.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most likely recipients of attacks are the two top candidates -- Biden and Sanders -- who have taken fire from a host of lesser known candidates eager to vault themselves into contention by punching up.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Hickenlooper and Delaney have both gone after Sanders from the right, faulting his view of Democratic socialism as out of step with what more Americans want.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""To his credit, Sanders has been consistent in his support for socialism and even, at times, communism,"" Delaney said in a statement on Wednesday, ahead of a speech Sanders gave on his view of Democratic socialism.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The opposite has happened with Biden, as most competing campaigns have shown a willingness to go after him from the left, questioning his liberal credentials and looking to undercut him with the party's base.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Sanders campaign has been the most aggressive in criticizing Biden, and a shared debate stage would give the Vermont senator an opportunity to confront the former vice president directly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But candidates like Buttigieg and Warren also tested out lines at events in June that are clearly -- even if not by name -- aimed at Biden.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Buttigieg, at an event in Iowa earlier this month, said ""some of my fellow Democrats... want to see a return to the 1990s or 2000... just as some conservatives want to return to the 1950s.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""That doesn't have to happen,"" the mayor added in a preview of a ""generational change"" line Buttigieg could use against the older candidate.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biden, too, has clearly been testing lines against these critiques.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I gather some people think that's a return to the past,"" he said in a recent speech. ""I don't see it that way. I see it as embracing the enduring values that have made America -- America.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are also wildcards in the field of Democratic contenders. Williamson is a largely unknown figure, and Yang, a businessman with a sizable following on line, has shown a willingness to hit hard at people like Biden.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Joe Biden must really not like to travel,"" Yang said on Sunday at a Democratic event that brought together 19 candidates. Biden declined the invitation because of his granddaughter's graduation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biden responded by saying it shouldn't be surprising that he picked his granddaughter's graduation over the event, saying he would have missed an inauguration to be with his family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yang, undeterred and in a sign of what he could do on the debate stage, responded: ""Out of 19 presidential candidates in Iowa this weekend, I guarantee you that several were missing family obligations. That's what happens when you run for president. If a front runner says that we have different values that's on him."" </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Rebecca Buck contributed to this report. </p>]"

""Lately more than ever people want someone who is tech savvy and nannies who can move into a family assistant role.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Such nannies work long hours or overnights and may even travel with the family. But they can make between $150,000 to $180,000 a year in places like New York or Los Angeles. Sometimes even more in the Bay Area. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Families are paying over $220,000 a year in San Francisco,"" says Anita Rogers, president and founder of British American Household Staffing. ""There's a value in paying well for your employees, especially in your household.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The six-figure nanny </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With more skills come higher rates. At Educated Nannies, a staffing agency in Los Angeles, nannies need to have college degrees and families appear to be most interested in candidates with backgrounds in child development.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Many of our families don't want any screen time for the kids,"" says Ryan Jordan, founder of Educated Nannies. ""So that's the time the nanny needs to bring in preschool curriculum and adventures.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But while a preschool teacher makes $13 to $15 an hour, or <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm"" target=""_blank"">around $30,000</a> a year according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, skilled nannies are commanding double that at $25 to $40 an hour. Some newborn care specialists in Los Angeles can even earn $70 an hour, says Ryan. At that rate, specialists working a schedule that some keep -- 9 or 10 hour shifts, six-days-a-week -- find it possible to earn $200,000, including overtime or travel pay.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heidi Joline has worked as a nanny for nearly 20 years. But she wasn't always so sure childcare was the right career for her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Saying you're a nanny doesn't get that 'Oh! You're a nanny? That's so exciting!' reaction from people,"" she says. ""It's like ""Oh, you're a nanny. When are you going to get a real job?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But after trying office work for a bit, she returned to nannying and realized she could grow in a way that was interesting to her, valuable to her families and a lot more lucrative than teaching preschool.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She has passed the International Nanny Association Exam, taken Yale courses on child rearing and Stanford courses on health across the gender spectrum. She has studied child psychology, newborn care and resilience following trauma. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Currently working with a family in Los Angeles, Joline prepares a curriculum every month for the preschooler she cares for. This month's theme is bugs, and she has planned a lineup of songs, stories and activities along with learning words in Spanish, French and Mandarin. She and the child even released 3,000 ladybugs into the wild. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In this field, things change all the time,"" Joline says. ""What we did with our children five years ago is not what we're doing now with regard to nutrition, socialization, education and overall well-being. You have to keep up with that to help inform the parents.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And her skills have not gone unnoticed: she was named 2019 <a href=""https://nanny.org/introducing-the-2019-nanny-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank"">Nanny of the Year</a> by the International Nanny Association.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""As a nanny you have to have those specialties and you have to continue your education,"" Joline says. ""In other places, it may be fine to just have CPR training, but if you're in the bigger markets, where you are expecting higher pay and working with higher-profile people, you need specialized skills to stand out."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She earns at least $30 an hour with additional pay for overtime, overnights or travel, allowing her to earn more than $100,000 a year. And now, as the child is spending more time at school, Joline is transitioning into a family assistant role, handling the organizational side of the family's life including grocery shopping, cooking meals, picking up dry cleaning, handling pool cleaners and housekeepers and making sure the family's dog has vet visits and a stock of food.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The newborn care specialist</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For some affluent families, bringing home a new baby may involve not just a nanny or two, but also a lactation consultant and a newborn care specialist. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's where Marly Higgins Driskell comes in. After 23 years as a traditional nanny, she was looking to stay in a career she loved, but expand her work. Her full title is now, ""Certified Credentialed Master Newborn Care Specialist,"" and her expertise is with high-order multiples like triplets, quadruplets and even quintuplets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I come in and help empower and educate the parents,"" she says. ""If there are other caregivers in the house, I will take the lead. What happens during the day impacts what happens at night.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Working with families for three to four months right after the birth, she sleep conditions the baby with gentle, non-cry-it-out methods. But don't confuse her with a night nanny, who is taking instructions from the parents. Higgins Driskell's role is more like a consultant.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She says that after a couple of months she often has babies sleeping 10 to 12 hours through the night with no feedings. Her fees, which in Houston are lower than those in New York or Los Angeles, start at $35 an hour, and she will sometimes work up to 80 hours a week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Like many professionals earning six figures and working long hours, she has help. She has her own personal assistant for correspondence, a social media assistant and a housekeeper to clean her home.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I run better when I have help,"" she says.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Now we're starting to get an idea of how much it will cost. </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">The space agency will need an estimated $20 billion to $30 billion over the next five years for its moon project, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told CNN Business on Thursday. That would mean adding another $4 billion to $6 billion per year, on average, to the agency's budget, which is already expected to be about $20 billion annually.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Bridenstine's remarks are the first time that NASA has shared a total cost estimate for its moon program, which is called Artemis (after the Greek goddess of the moon) and could send people to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century. NASA wants that mission to include two astronauts: A man and the first-ever woman to walk on the moon.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The overall goal of the Artemis program is to establish a ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/tech/nasa-clps-commercial-contract/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sustainable</a>"" presence on the moon, paving the way for astronauts to return to the surface again and again. Learning to live and work on another world, Bridenstine said, will prepare them for NASA's long-term mission: to put <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/opinions/united-states-lead-way-mars-astronaut-leroy-chiao/index.html"" target=""_blank"">people on Mars</a> for the first time in human history. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The $20 to $30 billion cost estimate is <a href=""https://spacenews.com/bridenstine-plays-down-costs-of-2024-moon-landing/"" target=""_blank"">less expensive than some had predicted</a> — though they're not necessarily the final figures. Bridenstine acknowledged that spaceflight can be dangerous and unpredictable, so it's practically impossible to settle on an accurate price tag.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're negotiating within the administration,"" he said. ""We're talking to [the federal Office of Management and Budget]; we're talking to the National Space Council."" (The National Space Council is a recently revived policy development group headed by Vice President Mike Pence.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Once we come to a determination within the administration,"" Bridenstine said, ""we will of course take that over to the Hill and make sure that our members of Congress are interested and willing to support that effort.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Will NASA get its money?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Winning over lawmakers, however, will likely be the most difficult part.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pence announced in March that the Trump administration wanted to speed up NASA's moon ambitions, and launch the first crewed mission in 2024 instead of 2028, the agency's earlier timeline. That's just five years away. And all the hardware that NASA needs is either delayed, way over budget or doesn't yet exist.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So far, NASA has formally requested only an additional $1.6 billion for Artemis, which Bridenstine has described as a small ""down payment"" for the overall program. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Meanwhile, members of Congress have been after the administration for a total cost estimate and a detailed plan on how it spend the money. Bridenstine will also have to win over Democrats who are already skeptical.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Critics also point out that NASA has poured <a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/nasa-nears-50-billion-for-deep-space-plans-yet-human-flights-still-distant/"" target=""_blank"">billions of dollars</a> into deep-space programs over the past 15 years, though humans still <a href=""https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/nasa-nears-50-billion-for-deep-space-plans-yet-human-flights-still-distant/"" target=""_blank"">have not been back</a> to the lunar surface since the final Apollo mission in 1972.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Apollo program also happened in a very different political environment. It was during a bitter Cold War standoff with the Soviet Union, and the United States was in a mad dash to beat its enemy to the lunar surface. All told, the United States spent about <a href=""https://history.nasa.gov/Apollomon/Apollo.html"" target=""_blank"">$25 billion on the Apollo program</a>, or nearly $150 billion in today's dollars. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some fear that NASA will end up diverting funds from its other programs, which include robotic exploration missions, Earth science and climate studies and other important scientific research.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I will tell you my goal — and I've been very clear about this — is to make sure that we're not cannibalizing parts of NASA to fund the Artemis program,"" Bridenstine said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, he said he's confident that NASA will convince Congress to get on board: ""I think there is a strong desire. It's bipartisan to explore, to learn, to understand the science and the history of our own solar system.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Breaking down the budget</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NASA and US taxpayers have already invested heavily in the rocket and spacecraft that will be used for the trip. But those projects have been routinely criticized. They're years behind schedule and way over budget.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/26/tech/nasa-commercial-rocket-sls-boeing-spacex/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Space Launch System</a>, or SLS, is the name of a gargantuan new rocket that promises to out-power any launch vehicle ever built and be capable of flinging people toward the moon or Mars. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">SLS was once expected to cost about $9.7 billion and start flying in 2017. But NASA has already spent at least $12 billion, according to a recent <a href=""https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-19-001.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Office of the Inspector General</a> report, and it's not expected to fly until next year at the earliest.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Similarly, Orion, the name of the spacecraft that will launch on top of SLS and carry astronauts out to the moon, is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget, according to the <a href=""https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/699373.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Government Accountability Office</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Other hardware NASA needs that doesn't exist yet: A small space station that will orbit the moon and serve as an outpost for astronauts, called the Lunar Gateway, along with a lander that's capable of taking people from the station down to the moon's surface. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">These are not cheap projects.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Still, NASA's expenses have been a drop in the bucket compared to many other departments. The annual Defense Department budget, for example, has reached $1.3 trillion per year. Health and Human services gets about $90 billion per year. And Homeland Security annually receives about $50 billion.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>What it means for business</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NASA isn't the only organization talking about going back to the moon. The United States has a booming commercial space industry, and SpaceX, the rainmaker of the industry, has its own plans to build a giant rocket and <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/18/technology/yusaku-maezawa-spacex/index.html"" target=""_blank"">fly tourists around the moon</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And NASA is paying attention: A significant chunk of research and development for the Artemis program will come from the private sector. It's part of NASA and Bridenstine's plan to lower costs and make space an entrepreneur-friendly environment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're going back to the moon, but we're doing it entirely different than we did in the 1960s,"" Bridenstine told CNN Business. ""The reason we need commercial operators is because they can drive innovation if they're competing on cost and innovation.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NASA has long worked with corporate contractors. Boeing, for example, helped build the Saturn V rocket that powered the Apollo program. And these days, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are primary contractors for Orion and SLS. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But NASA's commercial partnerships are different: The space agency wants private-sector companies to design, test and build technologies and then compete for lucrative government contracts. Essentially, Bridenstine says, NASA will become just another customer for companies in the business of space travel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The space agency has already made it clear it wants to turn to the private sector to take care of lunar landers. Three small companies that build robotic landers were awarded tens of millions of dollars from NASA to drop cargo off at the moon. And startups like Jeff Bezos' <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/tech/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-blue-moon/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Blue Origin</a>, which is building a crew-worthy lander called Blue Moon to compete for contracts to build crew-worthy lunar landers.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

A study published Wednesday in <a href=""https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaaw7123"" target=""_blank"">Science Advances</a> sheds light on the discovery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Previously, NASA's Voyager and Galileo spacecraft performed flybys of Europa, which led scientists to discover that the moon has a salty liquid water ocean beneath an icy shell. An infrared spectrometer aboard Galileo studied the shell and detected water ice and magnesium sulfate salts, which are similar to Epsom salts. It was believed that the shell was similar in composition to the same ingredients that made up the ocean. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""People have traditionally assumed that all of the interesting spectroscopy is in the infrared on planetary surfaces, because that's where most of the molecules that scientists are looking for have their fundamental features,"" said Mike Brown, study co-author and the Richard and Barbara Rosenberg Professor of Planetary Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, in a statement. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii provided new data with higher spectral resolution to show that the salts weren't magnesium sulfates.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We thought that we might be seeing sodium chlorides, but they are essentially featureless in an infrared spectrum,"" Brown said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kevin Hand, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, took ocean salt samples from Earth and hit them with radiation to simulate what it might be like on Europa. The sea salt changed color and could be identified in the visible light spectrum as yellow.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This was similar to an area on Europa called Tara Regio, which has a distinct yellow color. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Sodium chloride is a bit like invisible ink on Europa's surface. Before irradiation, you can't tell it's there, but after irradiation, the color jumps right out at you,"" Hand said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Follow-up observations with the Hubble Space Telescope confirmed that the yellow color of Tara Regio was due to irradiated table salt on Europa's surface.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Magnesium sulfate would simply have leached into the ocean from rocks on the ocean floor, but sodium chloride may indicate the ocean floor is hydrothermally active,"" said Samantha Trumbo, lead study author and California Institute of Technology graduate student, in a statement. ""That would mean Europa is a more geologically interesting planetary body than previously believed.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

He did not allow questions so journalists could challenge his assertions. And his decision not to allow a few days to elapse for a full investigation left no doubt about US intentions.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He left the room after warning the ""United States will defend its forces, interests, and stand with our partners and allies to safeguard global commerce and regional stability.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later on Thursday night, US Central Command released a video that it claims shows a smaller Iranian boat sailing up next to the tanker to remove an unexploded mine. An individual stands up on the bow of the boat and can be seen removing an object from the tanker's hull. The US says that object is likely an unexploded mine.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pompeo's approach will do nothing to quell anxiety that the United States and Iran are locked into an inexorable cycle of escalation that could trigger a disastrous war.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And after placing the prestige of the Trump administration on the line, he left open the question of Washington's next steps in dealing with a crisis that caused an immediate spike in oil prices and has few obvious off ramps.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>US piling pressure on Iran</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thursday's drama in which two ships were left ablaze forcing their crews to abandon their posts, was not an isolated incident. It's a product of rising tensions that Trump administration critics see as the logical result of a hardline approach heralded when the President pulled out of the international <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/08/politics/donald-trump-iran-deal-announcement-decision/index.html"" target=""_blank"">nuclear deal concluded by the Obama White House.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Washington insists its new strategy of economic and political pressure on Iran is aimed at driving the Islamic Republic back to the negotiating table. But many US allies fear it is more likely to lead to a military confrontation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Apart from Pompeo's swift warning to Iran over the attacks and the CENTCOM video, there has not yet been any independent international assessment that blames Iran or its proxies for the attacks -- though suspicion is hanging heavy on the Islamic Republic.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration's documented recor<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/10/politics/donald-trump-lies-fact-check/index.html"" target=""_blank"">d of perpetrating falsehoods </a>means it inevitably faces a higher bar for its statements on an issue as critical as Iran. Memories are also still fresh of botched intelligence that led the US into war with Iraq.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are no signs so far that Washington is preparing a military response to the tanker attacks. It is more likely to use them to bolster its case for Iranian malfeasance.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But it has the option to increase naval patrols in the area. Trump has already<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/26/middleeast/trump-middle-east-iran-analysis-trump-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank""> rushed an aircraft carrier strike force</a> to the region and is deploying 1,500 troops and a Patriot missile system to meet Iran's perceived threat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The US also called a UN Security Council meeting on the tanker strikes on Thursday but did not present any evidence to back up Pompeo's remarks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Uncertainty about what is next is also being fueled by indications that Trump is not on the same page as senior members of his national security team on Iran.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President, loath to get pulled into foreign misadventures, is seen as far less hawkish on the issue than Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Shortly after Pompeo spelled out his stern-faced warning, which Trump tweeted out, the President was still holding out the hope of eventual talks with Iran.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready, and neither are we!"" T<a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1139236468365434880"" target=""_blank"">rump tweeted.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iran will never be ready, if remarks carried by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's Twitter feed on Thursday are any indication.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't consider Trump as a person deserving to exchange messages with; I have no response for him &amp; will not answer him,"" Khamenei wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Fog of war hangs over tanker attacks</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The question of who is behind Thursday's attacks may not be quite as clear cut elsewhere as it is in Washington.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The fog of war in the region, with its bitter rivalries, opaque motivations and boiling tensions means that there are a number of conceivable explanations for the strike.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If Iran was involved, it might have been sending a pointed message to the US that it has the capacity to hold the world economy to ransom by attacking shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One of the ships involved was a Japanese tanker, in an embarrassment to one of Trump's closest allies, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/world/asia/japan-abe-iran.html"" target=""_blank"">Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</a> who was in Tehran hoping to broker an easing of tensions.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One way of looking at the targeting of a Japanese tanker would be to conclude that someone wants to send Trump a message that his vows to protect US allies are empty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But if Iran hoped to use Abe's visit to convince Japan to resume buying its oil despite US pressure it would not make much sense for the government to order an attack on a Japanese owned ship.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But decision making in Iran is not monolithic. Even if Iranian forces or proxies were to blame, the action may not have been ordered by political leaders in Tehran, who are locked in a constant power struggle with the ruling clerics.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps has in some cases the autonomy to act outside the auspices of the country's religious or political authorities.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Middle East's thriving conspiracy theory industry also means there are alternative rationales for the attacks. Might an Iranian foe like Saudi Arabia, keen for a US-Iranian confrontation, not have an interest in staging such an attack to reflect badly on Tehran?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Reported attacks on Japan-related tankers occurred while PM @AbeShinzo was meeting with Ayatollah @khamenei-ir for extensive and friendly talks,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif tweeted on Thursday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Suspicious doesn't begin to describe what likely transpired this morning.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The tanker attacks came a month after the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/05/politics/iran-carrier-bomber-task-force/index.html"" target=""_blank"">previous peak </a>in recent tensions, after four commercial ships were attacked in the Gulf, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen attacked a Saudi pipeline and they US pulled non-essential staff from its embassy in Baghdad -- a potential target for pro-Iran militias in Iraq.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The fact that this attack was more sophisticated and expansive than the previous one is sobering.

One job that the White House press secretary has is to promote the President's agenda and try to put the President in the best possible position to make his case. Just last week, the President did an interview in the American graveyard in Normandy with a highly partisan Fox News anchor. The President proceeded to desecrate the sacred ground by<a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/06/cnn_amanda_carpenter_trump_using_graves_of_world_war_ii_soldiers_as_a_prop_fox_news_helped.html"" target=""_blank""> launching partisan attacks</a> at his political opponents in the worst possible setting. Sanders' job was to anticipate what the President would say and make sure situations like this never happened.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The more important job is to keep the American public, the same public who fund her salary, informed through the traditional daily White House Briefing. For more than half a century, reporters, acting as proxy for the American public, would meet with the White House press secretary for a briefing almost every day. That came to a screeching halt under Sanders' watch. In fact, she has not done a briefing in <a href=""https://news.yahoo.com/white-house-press-secretary-sarah-sanders-is-leaving-the-white-house-203008180.html"" target=""_blank"">95 days</a> and has only done<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/sarah-sanders-out/"" target=""_blank""> eight  briefings in the last 300 days. </a>By contrast, in recent history, the most briefings that were ever done in a year were done in 1998, the year Republicans impeached President Bill Clinton, according to an analysis done by the<a href=""https://qz.com/1503024/2018-was-the-year-the-white-house-press-briefing-died/"" target=""_blank""> American Presidency Project. </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://qz.com/1503024/2018-was-the-year-the-white-house-press-briefing-died/"" target=""_blank""> </a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Many of my Democratic friends have argued no briefings are better than briefings where lies are told. I disagree. Briefings, even when the press secretary gives dishonest answers, allow reporters to surface important questions that the public has the right to ask. They also create a public record of the administration's response for historical purpose. That's one of the reasons I've been using Twitter every day to do a <a href=""https://twitter.com/joelockhart/status/1127952137567330304?lang=en"" target=""_blank"">""Shadow Briefing,""</a> an exercise that highlights the many questions the administration refuses to address.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, while we are on the question of honesty, this was another important failure of Sanders' tenure.  Some of it was beyond her control. President Trump, as of April 26, according to the Washington Post, has made misleading or false statements more than <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/29/president-trump-has-made-more-than-false-or-misleading-claims/?utm_term=.d5a69d086f09"" target=""_blank"">10,000 times </a>since taking office. But to my memory, I can't point to a single time Sanders acknowledged when the President misspoke.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her legacy of dishonesty is enshrined in the Mueller Report and is very telling. Many will remember the day she went after Former FBI Director James Comey, saying the White House had heard from many FBI agents who were critical of Comey's leadership. It was only when she was under oath and facing potential jail time did Sanders <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/18/politics/sarah-sanders-mueller-report/index.html"" target=""_blank"">admit </a>she made the whole story up. To be clear, she smeared a former high-ranking government official with a story that was made up from whole cloth.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But that's not the worst of it. When the Mueller Report was released, and she was no longer under oath, she backtracked on her story, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/19/sarah-sanders-mueller-report-defends-lying-james-comey"" target=""_blank"">reverting</a> to key parts of the lie she'd already admitted to. That shows she lacked the moral character to be in such an important job in the United States Government. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Finally, Sanders' job inside the White House is supposed to include being an advocate for the press and pushing for maximum transparency.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here, again, she failed. The normal channels of communication have been shut down. Now, government policy is routinely transmitted through at times incoherent and contradictory tweets. And one news outlet -- Fox News -- has been elevated to a position as partner of the administration, rather than functioning as a traditional newsgathering operation.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Given President Trump's performance with non-Fox anchors -- see Lester Holt and George Stephanopoulos --  it is somewhat understandable that Trump has <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/03/third-trumps-words-sit-down-interviews-were-said-fox-news-or-fox-business/?utm_term=.3c3e16b37fdc"" target=""_blank"">talked with Fox News more often </a>than with other news organizations. But it's the press secretary's job to make sure that all the media has access to the President, not just the ones who agree with him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Only time will tell how much lasting damage Sanders has done to the Office of the Press Secretary.  As for Ms. Sanders' ultimate legacy, I'll remember her as the press secretary who helped normalize the idea that the press is the enemy of the people. That's not a legacy to be proud of.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Like all White House employees, Kushner files annual ethics disclosure forms, which list positions he holds outside of government, assets with broad ranges of value, outside-of-government income and his liabilities.<strong> </strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some of the things we know about Kushner already are that he's in charge of coming up with a Middle East peace plan, he's been <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/politics/jared-kushner-axios/index.html"" target=""_blank"">chummy with the Saudi crown prince</a> the CIA <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/politics/cia-assessment-khashoggi-assassination-saudi-arabia/index.html"" target=""_blank"">thinks ordered </a>the murder of a US-based journalist and he <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/politics/democrats-mick-mulvaney-request-revoke-jared-kushner-clearance/index.html"" target=""_blank"">had trouble getting a security clearance</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But there is so very much we don't know about him. According to a<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/10/jared-kushner-real-estate-cadre-goldman-sachs"" target=""_blank""> report in the Guardian</a>, a real estate company called <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/18/politics/kushner-nyc-property-flipping/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Cadre</a> in which he has an interest got some money from Saudi Arabia through an offshore fund run by Goldman Sachs. Their report is based on two unnamed sources. CNN has not independently verified the report.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If true, does that mean Kushner can't be involved in Middle East policy? <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/politics/jared-kushner-middle-east-peace-plan/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Apparently not</a>. The situation illustrates that the US laws meant to identify conflicts of interest don't do much to prevent them, particularly when it comes to extremely rich people like Kushner with complicated financial root systems.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Cadre is among scores of LLCs in which Kusher reported owning a stake last year. In his filings, Kushner reported leaving his official positions with Cadre in 2017 and is not involved in day-to-day operations. It will be interesting to see if Kushner lists Cadre on new financial disclosures he was required to submit this year. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here's another example having to do with Kushner's interest in Cadre. Last November, the company pitched opportunities to take advantage of a tax break created by the 2017 tax overhaul that encourages real estate investment in low-income areas. Is it a conflict that Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, a fellow White House adviser, pushed hard for the so-called ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/04/politics/crew-ivanka-trump-opportunity-zones/index.html"" target=""_blank"">opportunity zone</a>"" tax break in the new tax law? She's showed up at events <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/12/politics/trump-kushner-opportunity-zone/index.html"" target=""_blank"">promoting the investment opportunity</a>. Watchdog groups asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A spokesman for Kushner and Trump told CNN at the time that the watchdog request was ""a politically motivated and meritless complaint.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But federal law ""prohibits Government employees from participating personally and substantially in official matters where they have a financial interest. In addition to their own interests, those of their spouse, minor child, general partner, and certain other persons and organizations are attributed to them,"" according to the Office of Government Ethics, which certifies them for other executive branch employees like Kushner, though not for the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Like his father-in-law's assets, Kushner's wealth is spread out like roots from a tree, and hard to follow in the very general forms he and other administration officials are required to file each year. Trump has argued those forms are more detailed than tax returns, but ethics watchdogs say that for a candidate like Trump, both should be released, and that the laws should be updated.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We have never seen an administration before with this level of issues with financial disclosures, both in number and scale,"" said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""The tone is set at the top, and when you have a President that does not appear to care about ethics issues -- especially around finances -- it's not surprising that you have an administration that doesn't either.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kushner's time in public service has been fraught with concerns from the moment he was hired, when <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/21/politics/jared-kushner-white-house-job-justice-department-ruling/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Department of Justice attorneys reasoned</a> that an anti-nepotism law applied only to executive agencies and that the White House itself, overseeing the executive branch, was not an executive agency.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When career officials, perhaps concerned foreigners might seek leverage over Kushner, whose financial empire is highly leveraged, denied him security clearance, Trump ultimately pushed it through, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/28/politics/nyt-trump-kelly-kushner-clearance/index.html"" target=""_blank"">according to a New York Times report</a> -- which he's entitled to do, though the President and Ivanka Trump both denied the President was involved.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Washington Post <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kushners-overseas-contacts-raise-concerns-as-foreign-officials-seek-leverage/2018/02/27/16bbc052-18c3-11e8-942d-16a950029788_story.html?utm_term=.63ed680e7cd3"" target=""_blank"">reported in 2018</a> that officials in four countries -- the United Arab Emirates, China, Israel and Mexico -- discussed ways of taking advantage of Kushner by exploiting his complicated business interests, though it's not clear what came of those conversations.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yet in May of 2017, Kushner's family business, from which he has stepped away from day-to-day involvement, tried to drum up investors in China for a New Jersey real estate project.

On November 20, in an appearance on ""Fox and Friends,"" <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/20/trump-no-campaign-roy-moore-249609"" target=""_blank"">Conway said this</a> about Democrat Doug Jones:</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>""Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don't be fooled. He will be a vote against tax cuts. He is weak on crime. Weak on borders. He is strong on raising your taxes. He is terrible for property owners.

In that interview, Conway also addressed those who said she was being too political. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Anytime I express a feeling about a candidate, people who want to make themselves relevant get air time and Twitter time, so I won't go there,"" <a href=""http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1712/06/nday.04.html"" target=""_blank"">she said</a>. Chris Cuomo, one of the ""New Day"" anchors, warned Conway that she needed to ""be careful about the Hatch Act.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She didn't seem to heed that advice. Which may not matter all that much, honestly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here's why: Although the Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency overseen by a Trump appointee, it has zero enforcement power. (The OSC is different than the special counsel's office, which sits under the Justice Department.) The OSC can make recommendations -- like that Conway should be terminated -- but it can't make that firing happen. And there's roughly a 0% chance Trump or his White House will do that. (White House spokesman Steven Groves called the OSC opinion<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/kellyanne-conway-office-of-special-counsel-hatch-act/index.html"" target=""_blank""> ""deeply flawed.""</a>)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But just because Conway isn't going anywhere doesn't mean this ruling from the Office of Special Counsel isn't revealing. Because it is. It's a window into how all lines are blurred in Trump's White House and how political calculation drives all the decisions that get made.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Let's start with that second part first. To be clear: The Trump White House isn't the first one to have political people -- like Conway, a former pollster and his winning 2016 campaign manager -- in it. Barack Obama had <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122420254658343011"" target=""_blank"">David Axelrod and David Plouffe</a> -- two leading campaign officials -- in his administration. George W. Bush installed <a href=""https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5481603"" target=""_blank"">Karl Rove</a>, his personal political Svengali, in the White House. And on and on it goes.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What's different about Trump -- and Conway -- is that this is a President who has been running for a second term, openly and actively, since almost the second he was sworn in as president. (On the day Trump was inaugurated, <a href=""https://publicintegrity.org/federal-politics/donald-trump-president-campaign-money-fundraising/"" target=""_blank"">he formed his 2020 reelection campaign</a>.) Through March 2019, Trump had already <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/11/politics/2020-map-donald-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">raised $97 million</a> for his 2020 race. He is expected to formally kick off his 2020 bid next week in Florida. And on and on it goes. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In short: Most presidents are political. They just have done their best to start the political part of the job as late as possible in their first term. Trump has always seemed to relish the purely political parts of the job, and so started doing them sooner than any president in modern history. That sets a tone for those who work for him -- including Conway.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And that traditional separation of politics and official government work has been further blurred by the fact that Trump has destroyed all lines of ""how things work"" in official Washington since arriving here in early 2017. He has <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/barr-doj-investiation-fbi-russia/index.html"" target=""_blank"">scolded the Justice Department</a> openly for not investigating what he thinks should be investigated. He has asked the White House counsel <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/mcgahn-trump-obstruction.html"" target=""_blank"">to say publicly</a> that Trump never instructed him to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. He has <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/15/politics/donald-trump-border-national-emergency-immigration/index.html"" target=""_blank"">declared a national emergency</a> at the border to get money to build a border wall that he was unable to secure through the normal legislative process.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over and over and over again Trump has snapped the rules that political Washington holds so dear. Conway thumbing her nose at the Hatch Act is all of a piece with that broader theory that the old rules of Washington don't mean anything in the new Trump order.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

He's won. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It is impossible that Kavanaugh should have appointed Chua-Rubenfeld without knowing that many would see this as payback for her mother's support.

Thus far, Kavanaugh and Chua-Rubenfeld have not commented on the hire.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">One can't avoid feeling sorry for Chua-Rubenfeld. Her childhood has already been exposed to public gaze in Amy Chua's witty bestseller ""The Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother"" (a more self-aware memoir of helicopter parenting than some may realize.)

Might it not have been simply a better idea to attend Harvard Law or (perish the thought!) Georgetown? Couldn't she have applied for a clerkship with Chief Justice John Roberts, instead of Kavanaugh?

""Lately more than ever people want someone who is tech savvy and nannies who can move into a family assistant role.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Such nannies work long hours or overnights and may even travel with the family. But they can make between $150,000 to $180,000 a year in places like New York or Los Angeles. Sometimes even more in the Bay Area. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Families are paying over $220,000 a year in San Francisco,"" says Anita Rogers, president and founder of British American Household Staffing.

At Educated Nannies, a staffing agency in Los Angeles, nannies need to have college degrees and families appear to be most interested in candidates with backgrounds in child development.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Many of our families don't want any screen time for the kids,"" says Ryan Jordan, founder of Educated Nannies. ""So that's the time the nanny needs to bring in preschool curriculum and adventures.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But while a preschool teacher makes $13 to $15 an hour, or <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/preschool-teachers.htm"" target=""_blank"">around $30,000</a> a year according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, skilled nannies are commanding double that at $25 to $40 an hour. Some newborn care specialists in Los Angeles can even earn $70 an hour, says Ryan. At that rate, specialists working a schedule that some keep -- 9 or 10 hour shifts, six-days-a-week -- find it possible to earn $200,000, including overtime or travel pay.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heidi Joline has worked as a nanny for nearly 20 years. But she wasn't always so sure childcare was the right career for her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Saying you're a nanny doesn't get that 'Oh! You're a nanny? That's so exciting!' reaction from people,"" she says. ""It's like ""Oh, you're a nanny. When are you going to get a real job?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But after trying office work for a bit, she returned to nannying and realized she could grow in a way that was interesting to her, valuable to her families and a lot more lucrative than teaching preschool.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She has passed the International Nanny Association Exam, taken Yale courses on child rearing and Stanford courses on health across the gender spectrum. She has studied child psychology, newborn care and resilience following trauma. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Currently working with a family in Los Angeles, Joline prepares a curriculum every month for the preschooler she cares for. This month's theme is bugs, and she has planned a lineup of songs, stories and activities along with learning words in Spanish, French and Mandarin. She and the child even released 3,000 ladybugs into the wild. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""In this field, things change all the time,"" Joline says. ""What we did with our children five years ago is not what we're doing now with regard to nutrition, socialization, education and overall well-being. You have to keep up with that to help inform the parents.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And her skills have not gone unnoticed: she was named 2019 <a href=""https://nanny.org/introducing-the-2019-nanny-of-the-year/"" target=""_blank"">Nanny of the Year</a> by the International Nanny Association.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""As a nanny you have to have those specialties and you have to continue your education,"" Joline says. ""In other places, it may be fine to just have CPR training, but if you're in the bigger markets, where you are expecting higher pay and working with higher-profile people, you need specialized skills to stand out."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She earns at least $30 an hour with additional pay for overtime, overnights or travel, allowing her to earn more than $100,000 a year. And now, as the child is spending more time at school, Joline is transitioning into a family assistant role, handling the organizational side of the family's life including grocery shopping, cooking meals, picking up dry cleaning, handling pool cleaners and housekeepers and making sure the family's dog has vet visits and a stock of food.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The newborn care specialist</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For some affluent families, bringing home a new baby may involve not just a nanny or two, but also a lactation consultant and a newborn care specialist. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's where Marly Higgins Driskell comes in. After 23 years as a traditional nanny, she was looking to stay in a career she loved, but expand her work. Her full title is now, ""Certified Credentialed Master Newborn Care Specialist,"" and her expertise is with high-order multiples like triplets, quadruplets and even quintuplets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I come in and help empower and educate the parents,"" she says. ""If there are other caregivers in the house, I will take the lead. What happens during the day impacts what happens at night.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Working with families for three to four months right after the birth, she sleep conditions the baby with gentle, non-cry-it-out methods. But don't confuse her with a night nanny, who is taking instructions from the parents. Higgins Driskell's role is more like a consultant.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She says that after a couple of months she often has babies sleeping 10 to 12 hours through the night with no feedings. Her fees, which in Houston are lower than those in New York or Los Angeles, start at $35 an hour, and she will sometimes work up to 80 hours a week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Like many professionals earning six figures and working long hours, she has help.

The countries say rapid withdrawal of the plotters by fast boats indicated understanding of the geographic area.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>June 13 attack</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most recent attack occurred a week later on June 13, when two tankers -- one carrying oil and the other transporting a cargo of chemicals -- <a href=""https://cnn.com/2019/06/13/middleeast/sea-of-oman-tanker-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">were struck in broad daylight</a> sailing through the Gulf of Oman, near the Strait of Hormuz. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Norwegian Maritime Agency said that three explosions were reported on board the Marshall Islands-flagged Front Altair oil tanker, which is owned by the Bermuda-based Norwegian company Frontline. The company said that a fire broke out after an explosion and that the cause of the blast was unclear.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A second vessel, the Japanese-owned chemical tanker Kokura Courageous, was ""attacked"" twice ""with some sort of shell,"" the ship's co-manager, Michio Yuube, said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The vessels were hit ""at or below the waterline, in close proximity to the engine room,"" said the International Association of Independent Tanker Owners (Intertanko). </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""These appeared to be well-planned and coordinated"" attacks, it added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">All 21 Philippine crew members on the Kokura Courageous were evacuated, Yuube said. The ship's Singapore-based management company, BSM, said a sailor was injured and the vessel had suffered damage to its hull.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The USS Bainbridge was nearby when the incident happened and a tug ferried crew members of the Kokuka Courageous to it. Images released by the US Central Command showed crew from the Bainbridge assisting the sailors following their rescue.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The 23 crew members of the Front Altair were picked up by a South Korean cargo ship, the Hyundai Dubai, which responded to their distress call.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to a Hyundai Merchant Marine official, the ship's captain said in an official report that he heard three explosions prior to the Front Altair's distress call. He went outside to the dock and saw the ship was on fire. Two sailors approached the Norwegian tanker on a lifeboat and rescued the 23 crew, bringing them to the Hyundai Dubai, which has now docked in Abu Dhabi. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Friday, the Japanese shipping company that owns the chemical tanker Kokuka Courageous said it did not believe the ship was attacked by a mine.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a press conference Friday in Tokyo, the president of Kokuka Sangyo Marine, Yutaka Katada, said he believed ""there is no possibility of mine attack as the attack is well above the naval line.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to Katada, a crew member said the second attack came from a flying shell. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Katada said that all crew members were now back on board the tanker, which is currently tagged to the UAE city of Khor Fakkan, and were working to get electricity fully up and running. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Iran blamed again</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pompeo <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/iran-us-tankers-pompeo/index.html"" target=""_blank"">blamed Iran</a> for the attacks, saying the assessment was based on intelligence but offered no evidence to support his claim.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It is the assessment by the United States government that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks that occurred in the Gulf of Oman today,"" Pompeo said in specially scheduled remarks at the State Department Thursday, as investigations into the attacks were beginning.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Thursday evening, the US military <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/us-images-iranian-boat-removing-mine/index.html"" target=""_blank"">released video</a> in support of Pompeo's claims of what it said showed an Iranian navy boat removing an unexploded mine attached to the hull of the Kokura Courageous. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the video, a smaller boat is shown coming up to the side of the tanker. An individual stands up on the bow of the boat and can be seen removing an object from the tanker's hull. The US says that object is likely an unexploded mine.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Another official told CNN that multiple Iranian small boats had entered the area where the Bainbridge continued to be on the scene, prompting US Central Command to issue a statement saying, ""No interference with USS Bainbridge, or its mission, will be tolerated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the Saudis ""have no reason to disagree"" with Pompeo's comments blaming Iran for being behind Thursday's attacks, saying ""Iran has a history of doing this.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Iran denies any involvement</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said ""suspicious doesn't begin to describe"" this latest incident, noting that one of the tankers is Japanese owned and the attack took place as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was visiting Iran in an effort to calm tensions between Washington and Tehran.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Alireza Miryousefi, a spokesman for the Iranian mission, tweeted a statement saying Iran ""categorically rejects the US unfounded claim"" that Iran is behind the attacks and ""condemns it in the strongest possible terms.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He added that Iran ""expresses concern"" over the ""suspicious incidents."" And he called it ""ironic"" that the US, which withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran, was now calling Iran to come back for negotiations and diplomacy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The UN Security Council privately discussed the latest on the attack but declined to produce any formal reaction.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Barbara Starr,  Vasco Cotovio, and Kara Fox contributed to this report.</p>]"

""I don't have time to celebrate.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Same. Also: ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDwqdSF6Ec"" target=""_blank"">I ain't got time to bleed</a>."" And away we go!</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>2. ""Yes, we'll have a little piece of cake tonight, but in the meantime we're doing a lot of things.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NO TIME TO CELEBRATE.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>3. ""I enjoy that doing more. That's better than taking it easy. There's always going to be plenty of time to take it easy, I guess.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, working is better than taking it easy. That said, there will be plenty of taking-it-easy time, allegedly.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>4. ""I don't think anybody's accomplished so much in two and a half years, what we've done.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Well, he has set one record in his first two-plus years in office; he's said more than 10,000 misleading or outright false things, <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/29/president-trump-has-made-more-than-false-or-misleading-claims/?utm_term=.042339f12e02"" target=""_blank"">according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker</a>.

So we have that.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Take that, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/us-images-iranian-boat-removing-mine/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Iran</a>! We have ""things that we can detect in the dark."" And they ""work very well."" BOOM.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>6. ""They were unstoppable and now they are in deep, deep trouble. They -- you can't -- you can't -- they don't have anything.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The President of the United States on Iran. In summary: deep trouble. Also, they don't have anything.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>7. ""I don't think anybody would present me with anything bad because they know how much I love this country. Nobody's going to present me with anything bad.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">OK. So Trump is saying it's fine that he <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/abc-george-stephanopoulos-donald-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">said he would listen to foreign countries</a> promising information on his political opponents because those countries would never say anything bad because they know how much he loves America. <a href=""https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/liars/n9373"" target=""_blank"">Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>8. ""if I was -- and, of course, you have to look at it, because if you don't look at it you're not going to know if it's bad.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>[raises hand tentatively]</em> What if, and I am just spit-balling here, you just don't accept information from a foreign power at all? Then you wouldn't need to look at it to see if it was good or bad, right?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>9. ""But, of course, you give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general or somebody like that. But, of course, you do that.</strong><strong>""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The FBI director is wrong because, frankly, it doesn't happen like that in life."" -- <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/abc-george-stephanopoulos-donald-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Donald Trump earlier this week</a>, insisting that he wouldn't have to tell the FBI about contacts with a foreign country offering information on an opponent.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>10. ""I thought it was made clear. In fact, I actually said at the beginning, I think I said I'd do both.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He did not. <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/abc-george-stephanopoulos-donald-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Here's what Trump did say</a>: ""I've seen a lot of things over my life. I don't think in my whole life I've ever called the FBI. In my whole life. I don't -- you don't call the FBI. Life doesn't work that way.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>11. ""I mean how can you report something that you don't know?""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>[raises hand]</em> Again, I am just a guy thinking out loud here. But what if, and I am repeating myself, you just said, ""I am not going to take any information on my opponents from foreign sources?"" Feels like that would pretty much cover our bases, right?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>12. ""Now, if I thought anything was incorrect or badly stated, I'd report it to attorney general, the FBI.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In this scenario, Trump -- and Trump alone -- has total and complete decision-making power over whether information passed on to him by a foreign power should be reported to law enforcement. Which, uh, well, seems like a lot of power to give to any one person.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>13. ""And I'm just thinking, gee, if they say, we don't like your opponent, am I supposed to put -- you know, the president of France, am I supposed to report him to the FBI?""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This is a total <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/politics/donald-trump-fox-news-hatch-act-fact-check/index.html"" target=""_blank"">straw-man argument</a>. At issue is not whether, say, Emmanuel Macron likes Joe Biden. At issue is a country hypothetically passing along negative information about Biden to Trump in hopes of manipulating the results of the election in a way they believe would be beneficial to them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>14. ""But nobody is going to say bad things to me. They know that I'm a very straight player.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's what you think foreign leaders think, eh? Interesting!</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>15. ""They spied on my campaign and they got caught, OK. They spied on my campaign and they got caught.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I don't know who Trump believes this ""they"" to be, but he is factually <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/14/politics/trump-russia-dossier-carter-page-fisa/index.html"" target=""_blank"">wrong about spying</a>.

""The big thing though is they spied on my campaign. That's probably one of the great criminal acts of all time.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The surveillance of Page was approved by a FISA court -- and re-authorized three times.

""So this is big stuff. We'll see how it turns out.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I guess <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM6RyuJkVgk"" target=""_blank"">we'll see what happens.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><strong>21. ""And, again, I stay uninvolved. I -- maybe I shouldn't. Somebody else would say, oh, he's involved. I say, we have a great attorney general. He's doing a great job.""</strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yes, Mr. President, the facts definitely bear out that you have stayed <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/02/politics/donald-trump-justice-department/index.html"" target=""_blank"">totally out of the business</a> of the Justice Department in your first two years in office.

""No, I'm not going to fire her. I think she's a terrific person. She's a tremendous spokesperson.

Talks about the nature of the border czar position are still ongoing, according to one of the officials. Prior to the President's announcement, aides had not finalized the nature and scope of the role and they had not formally vetted candidates, though Homan's name has been floated internally. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Among the potential problems associated with the czar role is structuring it in a way that does not run afoul of the statutory responsibility given to the Department of Homeland Security when it was created by Congress. According to this official, those decisions are still not settled, even after Trump made his announcement this morning. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This official did not know if or when the White House would move forward with formally announcing Trump's pick.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During a nearly hour-long interview on ""Fox and Friends"" Friday morning, Trump said the former acting Immigration and Customs director will be ""a border czar.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Tom Homan's coming back,"" Trump said, acknowledging that the news was supposed to be announced next week. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He's going to be very much involved with the border. That's what he really wants to be involved with,"" Trump continued, later adding, ""He'll be a border czar. He'll be reporting directly to me. He'll be probably working out of the White House but spending a lot of time at the border."" It's not clear what the position will entail or who the person filling the role would report to. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The new position comes amid a dramatic spike of apprehensions at the southern border and a Department of Homeland Security stretched thin. The department has lacked permanent leadership since Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was ousted in April.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This is the latest of several personnel announcements that Trump has announced before the White House was fully prepared, and even in some cases before the candidate themselves are notified. A year ago, for example, Trump made the surprise announcement of Robert Wilkie as his nominee to be the Veterans Affairs secretary as Wilkie was seated in the audience at an event about the criminal justice system. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'll be informing him in a little while -- he doesn't know this yet -- that we're going to be putting his name up for nomination to be secretary of the Veterans Administration,"" Trump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Homan, a career law enforcement officer, is the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He announced his plans to retire in 2018, and shortly after leaving the agency, he jumped to Fox News to be a contributor on the network.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Homan has been a steadfast defender of the President's immigration enforcement policies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Most recently, Homan touted an agreement reached by the US and Mexico to boost enforcement, calling it ""an achievement that has eluded past presidents."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""After threatening to impose tariffs on everything Mexico exports to the US, Trump got Mexico to agree to finally take greater action to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants into the US,"" he <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tom-homan-trump-mexico-agreement"" target=""_blank"">said in an op-ed published on Fox News</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Homan's name has previously been floated for the position of Department of Homeland Security secretary, a position behind held in an acting capacity by Kevin McAleenan.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

The Trump administration has already taken significant steps to help, and Thursday we took another one. A new Trump administration <a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-12571.pdf"" target=""_blank"">rule</a> will provide an estimated 800,000 businesses a better way to offer coverage and millions of workers a better way to obtain coverage, through the expansion of Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs). </p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">HRAs are employer-funded arrangements that workers use to pay for medical expenses. The Obama administration forbade workers in the individual insurance market to use HRAs to pay for coverage — significantly impeding employer flexibility and worker choice. Trump's new rule undoes this misguided restriction. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Starting on January 1, 2020, employers will be able to offer their workers HRAs to buy individual market coverage for themselves and their families. The administration's new rule addresses a major inequity by, in effect, providing the same tax advantage that traditional employer-sponsored group plans receive — exclusion of premiums from federal income or payroll taxes — to coverage that workers in the individual market purchase from an HRA. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The rule will significantly expand worker options since 80% of firms that provide insurance currently offer only <a href=""http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2018"" target=""_blank"">one type of plan</a>. Now, workers will be able to use tax-advantaged money from their employers to buy coverage of their choosing. This new flexibility will allow people<strong> </strong>to maintain their coverage when they switch jobs. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In particular, this new rule should help small business workers by making it possible for employers to fund coverage with less hassle and cost than maintaining a traditional group health plan. Between 2010 and 2018, the <a href=""http://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-Annual-Survey-2018"" target=""_blank"">proportion of workers</a> at firms with three to 49 workers covered by an employer plan fell by more than 25%. This rule should help reverse that decline. The rule also makes it easier for small businesses to compete with larger businesses for talent. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It will take roughly five years for the full impact of the rule to hit — at which point, we expect 11 million workers and family members to use HRA funds to obtain individual coverage. The HRA rule may increase the size of the individual market by upwards of 50%, and should spur a more competitive market that drives insurers to deliver better options to consumers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In addition to enhancing employer flexibility and worker choice, the HRA rule has the potential to reduce wasteful health care spending. The rule will make coverage costs more transparent, which should put downward pressure on insurance costs and lead employers to offer higher wages. Moreover, the rule allows employers to offer compensation arrangements that many workers will prefer, meaning that over time it should boost work and the economy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While some recklessly claim that the administration has been sabotaging the individual market, this rule makes clear we have been focused on expanding affordable options through choice and competition in all possible venues. We aim to deliver better results than previous policies centered on mandates and a ""Washington-knows-best"" mentality. Obamacare's many mandates still keep individual market premiums too high in many parts of the country, but this rule may spur necessary deregulatory reforms as more stakeholders now stand to benefit from a more competitive and free individual market.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today's action follows other significant Trump administration health care accomplishments. The president signed legislation to zero out the individual mandate penalty — freeing people to pay for their health care in ways that work best for them. The administration finalized a rule to open up another pathway for businesses, including many sole proprietors, to join together to obtain more affordable coverage through Association Health Plans (AHPs). (This rule is not currently in effect, and is under review in the courts.)</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The administration also finalized a rule to expand consumers' ability to purchase short-term plans, a much more affordable option for many since they are exempt from numerous federal mandates. The Council of Economic Advisers <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Deregulating-Health-Insurance-Markets-FINAL.pdf"" target=""_blank"">estimates</a> that Americans will receive nearly $50 billion of net economic benefit per year from the elimination of the individual mandate penalty, combined with the expansion of AHPs and short-term plans. Moreover, the HRA rule, combined with the rules for AHPs and short-term plans, is projected to result in nearly two million more people insured on net.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Although Congress has largely failed to fix problems with the nation's health care system, the president has created a freer, improved market. This rule is another important step by the Trump administration to offer businesses, particularly small businesses, and their employees greater options and control over their health coverage. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Well, the positivity's great."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But after this latest ""no touch"" revelation, Twitter fans are officially hailing Reeves as their ""respectful king,"" a man who is taking the lessons of #MeToo to heart. Many have suggested he can serve as a role model for other men confused about what respect for women's personal space looks like in platonic settings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Are we sure about that lofty praise? Certainly, Reeves seems like a wonderful guy. But he's also never spoken publicly about the reasons that he chooses not to touch women in pictures. Perhaps he's indeed being respectful of women. Or perhaps he's adopted a ""better safe than sorry"" attitude, as many men have since the sexual harassment reckoning—which could cast at least a little doubt on Reeves' altruistic intentions, since this attitude tends to cast men as unwitting, innocent victims to women's irrational, predatory motives. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And it's already proven damaging: <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-female-colleagues-in-the-metoo-era-heres-what-not-to-do-2019-05-20"" target=""_blank"">According to a recent LeanIn.Org survey</a>, 60% of male managers now express concern about mentoring, socializing or being alone with their women employees, up substantially from last year. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, being alone with women is different than taking a picture with a fan in a public place. But given the fact that powerful men like Al Franken and Joe Biden have taken hits for unwelcome touching in photographs and public settings, men everywhere are paying attention. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There's another perspective to be aware of, too, before we go and put every interaction between men and women these days through the #MeToo filter. And that's to consider that not touching people may be Reeves' personal preference. From all that we know of him—which isn't much, considering his 35 years of A-list movie stardom—he seems to be an introverted and somewhat socially anxious person, at least according to <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/keanu-reeves-is-too-good-for-this-world"" target=""_blank"">a recent New Yorker profile.</a> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He didn't grow up with privilege and has experienced some serious tragedies. In the late '90s, his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Syme, gave birth to their stillborn child, and then died two years later in a car accident. His father served some time for drug dealing when Reeves was a kid, and then left their family. Reeves moved all around the world with his mom, from Beirut to Sydney to New York to Toronto. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">All of which may be relevant: Certain traumas, and the amount of physical affection we received in early childhood, can go on to affect how comfortable we feel about being touched by others when we grow up.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Likewise, <a href=""https://www.med.upenn.edu/ctsa/social_anxiety_symptoms.html"" target=""_blank"">social anxiety,</a> an affliction that affects 12% of the adult population, is often correlated with touch avoidance. Reeves has described himself as having a ""wallflower demeanor"" at parties. There are also more intense neuroses that people have about being touched, like germaphobia and the most extreme iteration of touch avoidance, haphephobia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And thus there are a variety of plausible explanations for Reeves's no-touch policy of picture-taking. Unfortunately, like most of the rest of his life, the true reason may remain a mystery to the rest of us. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What we can pull from the conversation surrounding it, however, is that it's never a bad idea to be mindful of another person's personal space, whether female or male. And that even though we may think of Reeves as our internet boyfriend, if we have the good luck of encountering him out in the wild, it's wise to take a cue from his awareness of boundaries, and give him back what he's dishing out.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Trump marked it with a Rose Garden ceremony and an announcement that she would be expanding the platform, though details on that expansion have yet to be outlined with specifics. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There was the reveal, however, that she would at some point this year take another solo trip abroad, slated to be her second after an October 2018 visit to five countries in Africa. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the policy component of her tenure remains sparse, Trump does take a hearty role in many of the traditional components of being first lady, overseeing events such as the Easter Egg Roll or the annual holiday decorations, planning and practicing proper protocol for the overseas trips. She also remains a steady, quiet presence alongside the President for dignitary visits and announcements. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yet, in the absence of a familiarity and accessibility some Americans felt more with previous first ladies, such as Michelle Obama or even Laura Bush, there's a narrative that Trump is a reluctant first lady. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I still feel that she's one of the most unconventional first ladies we've ever had,"" said New York Times opinion columnist Frank Bruni in the CNN special report, ""Woman of Mystery: Melania Trump,"" set to air Friday night at 9 p.m. ET.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Many of the recent ones have not really seemed to want the job. You know, their husbands ran for President against their wishes, they went along with it to be supportive. But Melania is the apotheosis of that. And, I feel, and what I think has been consistent through the campaign, through the entire administration so far, is this sort of distance that she keeps from the role,"" said Bruni.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her husband, however, often heaps praise on his first lady. On Friday, while discussing his new Air Force One paint plans, the President favorably compared Melania Trump to Jackie Kennedy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You know, the baby blue doesn't fit with us. And people get used to something but that was Jackie O, and that's good, but we have our own Jackie O today, it's called Melania,"" Trump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Small but fierce staff</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady's deputy chief of staff and communications director, Stephanie Grisham, has a decidedly different opinion, which she shared while providing rare access to the East Wing of the White House. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Grisham's office is adjacent to office of Melania Trump, and she says she is ""literally the first line of defense"" when it comes to defending her boss. She cites the strong bond the first lady has created with her small team, at 12 members a skeleton crew of an East Wing staff when compared to those of Obama and Bush, both of whom had at least 20 or more working for them in various official capacities. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Grisham told CNN it was by Trump's design that her team feel trusted and supported, and there was not a hire that the first lady did not personally oversee. It's an interesting juxtaposition to the West Wing, with it's frequent staff turnovers and rumors of infighting among aides. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Working in the East Wing, being so small, we are tight knit,"" Grisham said. ""We have to be. We're very close."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady is actively involved in the day-to-day business of the East Wing and White House activities, Grisham said, adding that Trump is a ""fun"" and engaged boss. The first lady often takes the time to put staff at ease by listening to them and she knows about their families and their lives outside of the White House. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But there are those who say that the lack of a more robust staff, while lending itself to better personal interaction, could signal a disinterest in her role. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think (a small East Wing staff) puts you at a tremendous disadvantage and also sends a message about how much you're willing to do and how much you want to do,"" said Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of ""First Women: the Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>'My own voice'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If messaging is a concern of Trump's, she clearly doesn't focus on it. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While previous first ladies have practiced the art of going along with their husbands, personally, politically, publicly, Melania Trump has chosen a different route. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I have my own voice and my opinions,"" Trump said at her one and only on-camera, on-the-record news conference last October in Egypt. ""It's very important to me that I express how I feel."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After all, the first real stand the first lady took in her tenure was to break the mold by not moving to Washington for six months after the inauguration, citing the need to remain in New York while her son finished the school year. That move should have been a signal to the other notes of independence to come, including traveling solo when she feels like it, not commenting during scandals about infidelities or improprieties. She also has occasionally spoken out when her take doesn't necessarily jibe with that of the President's -- be it about cyberbullying, which television news channel she prefers or how she feels about NBA superstar LeBron James. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is clearly an independent streak in her which I think surprises people just because in so many other ways, she seems like an old-fashioned wife,"" Bruni said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of course, she is married to Trump, and her opinions, and lack of clarification, have stirred controversy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2011, she went on ABC's ""The View,"" and said, like her husband, that she felt Barack Obama needed to show his birth certificate, expressing suspicion over where he was born. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump has never commented on or clarified those remarks. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She also said in Africa that while she was glad female accusers claiming abuse are heard, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/10/politics/melania-trump-metoo-evidence/index.html"" target=""_blank"">she said they need ""hard evidence,"" before they come forward</a>, a staid take amid the #MeToo movement's commitment to believing women. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Backlash </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She has also suffered backlash simply by proximity to Trump. Many critics think that she can't preach anti-bullying while she is married to a man who regularly uses social media to name-call and grandstand. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't always agree (with) what he tweets, and I tell him that,"" said Trump in Egypt, a refrain she has said several times before. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It is a note of insight into the first lady that perhaps peels back some of the mystery. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Here is a first lady who is saying that of the many disparate components of her job (a job that has no official description), is not to control the President, nor blindly agree with him on all fronts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rather, she is vocalizing that there are parts of his behavior that bother her, too. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Melania Trump is never beholden to the Washington ways of broadcasting everything you're thinking and doing,"" Kellyanne Conway told CNN in an interview for ""Woman of Mystery: Melania Trump.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The first lady is also, unlike the President, and unlike those in her role before her, hardly concerned with how she is viewed by an American public in one of the most divisive political climates in history. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't think Melania's after popularity,"" Bruni said. ""Because you're only after popularity and poll numbers if you're going to try to turn them into something, if they're currency.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">This weekend marks four years since Melania Trump came down the escalator in Trump Tower alongside Trump when he announced his presidential bid. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She was then, as she is now, expressionless, calm, refined and difficult to read. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I get the feeling that she cares less about what people think than any of her predecessors,"" Bruni said.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

The private quarters are just that -- private -- and reserved for just her, her husband and their son.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Mar-a-Lago is her respite.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family compound of the Trump orbit at the approximately 20-acre estate-turned-private club nestled on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean in Palm Beach, Florida, are relatively modest, as far as their homes go, according to a member familiar with the layout.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The suites of rooms aren't vastly expansive in terms of square-footage -- tiny compared to the three floors of the Trump Tower family penthouse in Manhattan and a fraction of the four floors of the Executive Residence of the White House. There is a coziness to the place, even if it is one of the largest estates in Florida.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is no private pool for the family, no private spa, no separate driveway. In fact, the proximity to the rest of the guests, many of whom have known one another socially for a period of time, breeding the club-like atmosphere, is both surprising and familial.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The heavily secured area, like most of the property, is essentially attached to the rest of the club's facilities, where members and member-guests can stroll about, dine, socialize, frequent the vast outdoor facilities, the tennis courts, the croquet courts or the Beach Club. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">President Trump's Mar-a-Lago is the shiny penny of his wealth, a sprawling example of what he has acquired, the literal interpretation of showing off. He rarely leaves its confines, with the exception of golfing at his club. Melania Trump is loathe to leave the grounds, too, it turns out, and spends most of her vacation days on property, secluded from the hoi polloi members, mostly having quality time with her son and her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who also spend a decent portion of the year at Mar-a-Lago.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over the Christmas holiday, the first lady spent three weeks out of the public eye at Mar-a-Lago, save for the approximately four days she was in Washington and on a surprise visit to troops in Iraq. This month, for spring break, she has been away from Washington at Mar-a-Lago since March 19, and is scheduled to return Sunday evening. Her year is peppered with mini-breaks there, too -- the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend, Easter, Thanksgiving. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yet, like many things with Trump, there remains a screen of privacy around her visits down here, an oblique notion that she is off somewhere, for large chunks of time away from the White House, doing whatever she sees fit to do, at her own pace, on her own schedule, unrelated to that of her husband, or his priorities or habits -- an independent way of life that has become the calling card of this administration's first lady.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She has a long history with Palm Beach, yes, but she stays to herself for most part,"" said Laurence Leamer, part-time Palm Beach resident and author of ""Mar-a-Lago: Inside the Gates of Power at Donald Trump's Presidential Palace."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Leamer has long been a chronicler of Trump and his Palm Beach habits, even pre-presidential, and, as such, those of Trump's third wife. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""All these ladies in Palm Beach,"" said Leamer, speaking generally of the overtly monied set of denizens in one of the country's wealthiest towns, ""they go to Worth Avenue to shop, they dress up and they pay these exorbitant prices for clothes and things, and that's part of the scene. That's what they do here, that's the life. But not Melania Trump.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The visits</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Trump departed Washington for Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, told CNN spring break at the property was ""an annual tradition"" for the family. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are few who would argue against Trump's fierce commitment to her 13-year-old son to provide as ""normal"" a life as she possibly can for him. As such, Trump hasn't diverted from the occasions and events that have brought her down here since he was born. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Grisham, during the 2018 Christmas holidays, which coincided with the longest government shutdown in history, said something similar when pressed by CNN about the first lady's use of government funds to fly to and from Palm Beach and Washington (Air Force planes are required for the first lady of the United States, per security guidelines.) </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It has long been the family's tradition to spend their Christmas holiday at Mar-a-Lago. Her plans to travel with her son to their Florida home for his winter break have not changed this year,"" said Grisham at the time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For many of the rich folk who ""winter"" in Palm Beach, away from chilly East Coast temperatures and snow, Palm Beach means parties and social clubs and nights on the town. But for Melania Trump, Palm Beach is hearth-centric, it's where she makes sure things are consistent, where she can care take annual traditions and where she can hunker down, away from the headlines and chaos.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Since becoming first lady, Trump's Mar-a-Lago days include other additions to her usual calendar of vacation and self-care. She now travels there with at least one staff member, typically Grisham, whose full title is deputy chief of staff for communications. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump and Grisham meet regularly while in Palm Beach, Grisham told CNN, to discuss events and off-site visits (this week Trump hosted Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Juan Guaido, the president of the country's National Assembly, who the Trump administration recognizes as Venezuela's acting president. She also dropped in on a local elementary school to talk about bullying with the students).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They also plan upcoming White House obligations (such as the Easter Egg Roll) and future travel. Trump is, Grisham said, in ""constant communication"" with her and the rest of her small East Wing team back in Washington.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Yet there is another component of her Mar-a-Lago life that is more personal than professional; it is where Trump has lengthy one-on-one time with her husband, the President.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>'They dine for hours'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Dinner guests at Mar-a-Lago are used to seeing them by now. The couple huddled on the candle-lit patio during dinnertime, talking, sometimes for two, three hours. Only interrupted by friends who come over to shake his hand or wish him a pleasant evening, Donald and Melania Trump are mealtime fixtures at the club's formal outdoor restaurant, often eating dinner together both Friday and Saturday nights on weekends when Trump is in town, says a White House official.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What married couple spends three hours together alone at dinner?"" Leamer, who has observed the Trumps on several occasions rhetorically asked. ""They're there so long, other people are leaving and they're just ... there. They dine for hours. He likes a small table, a four-person table, so people can come over to say 'hello' but there's not enough room to invite people to join."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The cozy dinners at Mar-a-Lago might fly in the face of the oft-thought common perception the first couple are irretrievably detached.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's extraordinary for what a public personality Trump is that part of him is very private, and so is she. I am talking in the sense he and she don't necessarily like interlopers,"" said Leamer. ""Trump has always got to be the center of attention, so if you go to someone else's party, he's not always going to be that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Trump does have dinner guests, instances of which there have been publicly circulated photographs, there is typically no more than two or three other couples, oftentimes old friends from New York, or members of his inner political circle. A creature of habit when he's not eating alone with Melania Trump, the President isn't looking to make new friends. Nor is he looking to widen his culinary inclinations. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Leamer writes in his book how particular Trump is about his vacation menu -- and how many Mar-a-Lago chefs have rotated in and out through the years. As such, Melania Trump doesn't challenge the kitchen either. Though she may not eat Trump's favored blackened steaks and burgers or meatloaf, she keeps her tastes simple and healthy. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melania Trump does, however, oversee menus for bigger family events, including Thanksgiving, Easter and Christmas. But for dinners à deux, the focus is on the conversation, not the cuisine. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Those two will go and sit at dinner, and they are in the most in-depth conversations, and will talk and sit there for hours, literally,"" a White House official told CNN, confirming Leamer's account of the first couple's habits. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A long history</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mar-a-Lago was one of the first places Trump took his new girlfriend, then-Melania Knauss, when they first started dating in late 1998, early 1999, and it quickly became one of her favorite getaways, and remains so now, two decade later.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Melania Trump is following a long tradition of first ladies seeking to escape the claustrophobic White House,"" says Kate Andersen Brower, CNN contributor and author of ""First Women: the Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies."" ""I think she's been more successful than most because there is so much going on in her husband's West Wing that she can fly under the radar more than Michelle Obama or Laura Bush ever could.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bush had the family ranch in Crawford, Texas, Obama had Christmases in Hawaii and summers on Martha's Vineyard, but when those first ladies vacationed, it felt planned and regimented. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The Reagans had Rancho del Cielo or 'Ranch in the Sky,' "" said Brower. ""But they were so attached at the hip they often went there together."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rarely did they spend as much time apart as do the Trumps.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump has Mar-a-Lago, and in the summer, when south Florida becomes sticky with heat and humidity, she can also escape to New Jersey, where she and her family have more private quarters within a private club, the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster. Trump's options are more vast, her movements more mysterious and her activities, when she's not working with her team, more cloaked in privacy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's desire to be away is perhaps more akin in terms of predecessors to Jacqueline Kennedy, who would spend long weekends away from the White House at Glen Ora, the 400-acre estate in Virginia horse country that the Kennedys rented.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brower writes in her book, ""First Women,"" ""according to Jackie's Secret Service agent, Clint Hill, between the summer of 1961 and the summer of 1962, the first lady spent nearly four months away from Washington. She often left on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning and would not return until Monday afternoon or even Tuesday morning.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Summers for Kennedy were spent in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, where the fabled Kennedy compound was located. But Jackie Kennedy, like Trump, also spent time in Palm Beach for Christmas and Easter, and she had a fondness for escaping to her family's estate in Newport, Rhode Island, where she and John Kennedy were married.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mar-a-Lago contains marital memories for Trump, as well. While the ceremony was held at nearby Episcopal church Bethesda-by-the-Sea, the Trumps' lavish wedding reception in 2005 was held in the club's gilded ballroom, which had recently completed a $42 million renovation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's six-figure couture gown helped land her the cover of Vogue magazine, and at the reception dinner guests were served gold-flecked hors d'oeuvres, steak and lobster, and they swilled expensive Champagne. As the party spilled out into the pool area after dinner, Trump changed into a white Vera Wang slip dress, better for dancing, which the newlyweds did until the wee hours. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mar-a-Lago also served as the backdrop for the weddings of Donald Trump, Jr, and Eric Trump -- and more recently, guests opting to hold their wedding at the club are sometimes to treated to a brief audience with the President, if he's in town.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even when they're with family at Mar-a-Lago, especially Donald Trump's extended clan, those who observe the first lady say she and her parents and her son form their own impenetrable, less approachable entity. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And when she's there for her husband, ""she is on his arm, spectacularly dressed, even if just for the members to see,"" said Leamer. ""Mar-a-Lago is the one place where he feels truly relaxed, he feels comfortable there -- and I think that's true of her as well.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

(Think long skirts for women and waistcoats for men.) Guests of the Royal Enclosure, where the most formal dress is required, as well as more flexible areas, don their best ""in respect of the event and its history,"" she explained in an email.  </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But what has been deemed Ascot appropriate has changed tremendously since 1711, when horse aficionado Queen Anne first founded the annual race. The fashions on show serve as a cultural barometer, reflecting an era's trends and social norms, and an ever-evolving dress code. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""Royal Ascot provides a needed space in fashion for the marrying of tradition and eccentricity,"" Murray said. ""In the future, it will continue to adapt and evolve as it has since the first race in 1711, responding and reflecting society and fashion, and showcasing British style.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It was Beau Brummell, a Regency dandy and close friend of the future King George IV, who implemented Ascot's first dress code. In 1807, he decreed that ""men of elegance"" should wear waisted black coats with white cravats and pantaloons. However, Brummell left no guidance for the elegant women in attendance. Instead, their Ascot choices were to be guided by less tangible forces. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In the 1800s, the standard was set by Queen Victoria, whose influence was such that when she wore a <a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/history-white-wedding-dress-royal-wedding/index.html"" target=""_blank"">white wedding dress</a> to marry Prince Albert in 1840, she sparked a tradition that is still followed around the world today. According to Ascot Racecourse, the organizing body behind Royal Ascot, the Queen set a vogue for porter bonnet (a headpiece that shielded the face from observers) when she wore one to Ascot in the 1830s. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The royal influence was also felt in 1910, the year of the famed ""Black Ascot."" As the royal family mourned the death of King Edward VII, guests wore all black out of respect. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">After World War One, Ascot became a showcase for the trends taking hold on both sides of the Atlantic. This meant shorter hemlines, pearls and furs in the 1920s, and the nipped-waists and A-line skirts of Christian Dior's New Look in the 1950s. (Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret were both fans of the silhouette, and the latter wore a cream dress by the designer to Ascot in 1952.) </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">While it was long known that there were certain expectations around what to wear Ascot, it was only in 2012 that the event organizers released a formal style guide for racegoers, outlining dress code regulations for the Royal Enclosure and the Queen Anne Enclosure to help racegoers to dress appropriately for the occasion. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The strictest rules are reserved for the invitation-only Royal Enclosure, which was initially established as a private space for guests of King George III in 1807. Here, men are advised to wear black or gray morning dress (a formal suit comprising a coat with tails, a waistcoat and trousers, accessorized with a tie), along with a plain black or gray top hat. Women's hemlines must fall just above the knee or lower, and straps on dresses or tops should be at least one inch wide. (Off-the-shoulder <a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-43330899"" target=""_blank"">Bardot necklines</a> were banned in 2018.) Hats are mandatory, and there are strict rules around the base size of headpieces. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""Institutions such as Ascot and the (Henley) Royal Regatta have gradually evolved their dress codes over the years to reflect changes in society and fashion,"" said Rupert Wesson, academy director at Debrett's, the leading authority on British etiquette, in an email. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""However, they have been careful to do so in ways that do not detract from the sense of occasion.

This, even though the engraving plate for it was completed ""as recently as May 2018"" a Treasury Department employee told the New York Times. The employee also said the design ""appeared to be far along in the process,"" according to the Times.  Apparently so — as we all saw a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/us/politics/harriet-tubman-bill.html"" target=""_blank"">picture of it </a>leaked to the press.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Pay no attention to that, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has indicated. There are technical difficulties and they will persist until long after President Trump leaves office, he tells us. We'll pause here to note that the plan for the Tubman bill originated with Trump's predecessor, the first black President of the United States. President Barack Obama referred to Harriet Tubman — an abolitionist who led enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad — <a href=""https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/25/presidential-proclamation-harriet-tubman-underground-railroad-national-m"" target=""_blank"">as ""an American hero</a> ... [who] fought tirelessly for the Union cause, for the rights of enslaved people, for the rights of women, and for the rights of all."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2016, candidate Trump told NBC that stripping his favorite president, the populist and slave owner, Andrew Jackson, from the $20 bill was ""<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/21/politics/donald-trump-tubman-bill-political-correctness/index.html"" target=""_blank"">pure political correctness</a>."" He suggested that Tubman be bumped to the $2 bill, which is no longer printed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the scheme of things, this is not the worst thing the President or his administration has done to disrespect a source of black pride, but it is telling. This President's belief in white supremacy knows no bounds and perhaps a better descriptor would be to start referring to him as our white-supremacist-in-chief.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He has claimed that he is the <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history"" target=""_blank"">""least racist person""</a> we know. Yet starting in <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2016/7/25/12270880/donald-trump-racist-racism-history"" target=""_blank"">1973</a> we learned otherwise when the Justice Department under President Richard Nixon sued the Trump Management Corporation for <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/12/racism-and-donald-trump-a-common-thread-throughout-his-career-and-life"" target=""_blank"">refusing to rent apartments to blacks</a>, among other things. (Trump settled the suit without an admission of guilt.) </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Next up let's take his involvement in the Central Park jogger case. I was living in New York at the time and the case of those innocent youngsters — Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise — left an indelible mark. I remember Donald Trump taking out <a href=""https://time.com/5597843/central-park-five-trump-history/"" target=""_blank"">full page ads</a> in newspapers to advocate for the death penalty. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2014 the Exonerated Five received a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/nyregion/41-million-settlement-for-5-convicted-in-jogger-case-is-approved.html"" target=""_blank"">$41 million settlement</a> from New York because another man confessed and had the DNA to prove it. Yet Donald Trump stated in 2016 in an interview with CNN that he still believed their guilt. Facts and simple justice do not get in the way of white supremacy, it just bulldozes over anything that would challenge the notion that whites belong at the top and blacks at the bottom.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Some could argue that Trump started his run for President off birtherism claims and his questioning of President Obama's<a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/politics/donald-trump-barack-obama-birth-certificate-nyt/index.html"" target=""_blank""> American citizenship</a>.

They failed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From our camera position south of Tyre, we watched daily as volley after volley of Katyusha rockets roared out of the banana groves toward Israel. Frequent Israeli air strikes didn't appear to have any impact on the men launching the rockets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iran provided -- and continues to provide -- training, weaponry and equipment to Hezbollah.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As the US and Iran rush perilously close to a violent confrontation, the example of Hezbollah's 34-day war with Israel comes to mind. A war between Iran and the US would pit the mighty American military machine against a much smaller but highly mobile array of Iranian forces and allies spread around the Middle East. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Regardless of the details behind Thursday's attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, a confrontation between Iran and the United States became ever more likely after the Trump administration unilaterally pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal last year, brought on by ultra-Iran hawks Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State and John Bolton as National Security Advisor, and then began to tighten the screws on Iran with ever more punishing economic sanctions.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US policy toward Iran now is maximum sticks, no carrots. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Iran is very different to Saddam's Iraq</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unlike Saddam Hussein's Iraq in 2003, however, Iran has plenty of sticks at its disposal. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In 2003 Iraq was a shadow of its former self. I recall driving to Baghdad two years before the war and being stopped at an Iraqi Army checkpoint in the desert. The gaunt, weary troops didn't ask for our papers. They asked for food and water. By 2003 Iraq was weak and isolated. In his hour of need, no one came to Saddam's aid.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iran is different. It has armed and trained Hezbollah, perhaps one of the most effective fighting forces in the Middle East. It has backed the Houthis in Yemen, who have managed to fight the US-backed and armed Saudi and Emirati armies to a standstill. An array of militias in Iraq receive support from Iran. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Plus, Tehran has had close ties with Syria going back to the 1979 revolution. Iranian troops and advisers helped, along with Russia and Hezbollah, to keep Bashar al-Assad in power. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Iran has plenty of IOUs it can call in.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Its friends have already made it clear they won't stand idly by if Iran is attacked.

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have been separated. Warren is in the Wednesday group, giving the senator from Massachusetts the first -- potentially more high-profile -- shot at being mover and shaper of the policy conversation. She may also set the standard for the progressive alternative to former Vice President Joe Biden, who is in the Thursday group. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Biden has been clustered with a number of his higher-polling competitors, including Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, which means that he could come under tougher fire than he might have on the first night.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But even before the announcement, three Democrats were furious that they didn't qualify. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Miramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam failed to garner the required 1% support in three polls or donations from 65,000 people (or both). As The New York Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/democratic-debates-2020.html"" target=""_blank"">noted Thursday,</a> parties knocking candidates out of the prime-time spots based on early polling can indeed be a mistake. In 1992, Paul Tsongas wasn't even at 1% in the early polls but was able to defeat Bill Clinton in 15 contests. Had the current debate chess rules been in effect, Jimmy Carter would never have made the screen. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Given these and other factors, it is worth asking: Are these debates really so important? Well, yes. While there is a tendency within the media to exaggerate the long-term impact of any of the events that take place along the way of a presidential campaign -- including these debates -- the candidates (the chosen and the bumped) know the importance of televised faceoffs is real.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To be sure, the nature of party candidate selection has been changing in significant ways. Winning the nomination is no longer primarily about retail politics, for example, nor is it all about the local anymore. The number of national media events and moments that take place before the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary is now immense. The permanent campaign is a reality. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What we have witnessed over the past two decades is the construction of a vast media-political complex that covers and analyzes politics on a full-time basis. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It started with cable television in the 1980s and 1990s, which soon became a dominant form of news, filled with stations -- some partisan, some neutral -- devoted to covering politics almost 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This automatically extended the time of the political campaign by creating vast amounts of airtime where politics would be reported on, discussed, debated and analyzed long before the first caucuses and primaries took place. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The expansion of the internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s only strengthened this new world of media. The internet created an online community with an instantaneous and global reach, breeding online newspapers, magazines, blogs and bulletin boards focused on upcoming campaigns. Politicians were often forced to respond to stories that emerged in this space from the moment their candidacies became clear. Some of them, astute about the opportunities taking shape, tried to exploit this part of the media landscape to build the kind of momentum and excitement that were once reserved for early caucuses and primaries.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Then came social media -- Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005) and Twitter (2006) -- adding yet another dimension to the vast universe of political information. The kinds of editorial and production controls on information that still existed in the formative era of cable disappeared.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Candidates could speak directly to voters whenever they wanted. Voters, commentators, political operatives and anyone else could get their message out right away. Viral moments meant that a candidacy could be made or broken within a few hours outside of any voting.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The impact of all this media space for campaign politics, and the thirst for content, became clear in the 2016 primaries, with a series of televised debates that took place in both parties during 2015 and 2016. Republicans put together a two-tiered structure, given the huge number of candidates who were running. Voters were bombarded with campaign events from both parties. The Republican contest was more like a WWE steel cage match filled with contestants while the Democratic primaries took on the drama of a Frazier-Ali series of boxing matches. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So, there is a good reason that candidates are extremely focused on their placement, the structure and the format. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While none of these debates will likely be a make-or-break moment, in a field this crowded they could have a very significant influence on elevating candidates and helping Biden's opponents gain more traction against him. They will also create opportunities for candidates, including Biden, to stumble.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The power of this media-political complex has already been made clear yet again with the meteoric rise of Buttigieg, who has used interviews and carefully tailored tweets to make a serious candidacy for himself. And in her own way, Warren has <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-pete-buttigieg-2020.html"" target=""_blank"">figured out </a>how to use the announcement of substance-based policy plans as a way to keep media attention as she gradually climbs in the polls.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Debates are never what they are hyped up to be, but they are extremely significant in this politically cluttered age.  Candidates face each other -- unmediated by aides and Twitter -- and American voters, just on the other side of the camera, get a look at who they are. They need to respond to challenges in real time and they are forced to handle the back-and-forth with opponents rather than find shelter in the silo of a campaign.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The cumulative effect of the events starting in June and going through Super Tuesday can set the terms of the actual voting that will take place between Iowa and Super Tuesday.</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Puzzled white people ask what your parents were thinking. Black people wonder if you're trying to play a bad joke.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">It can be exhausting constantly explaining yourself to white people, even though you're white.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At least one to three times a week, someone is saying something about my name,"" says LaKiesha Francis, a 28-year-old bartender who lives in a small town in western Ohio. ""It kind of gets old.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We hear a lot about what are known as ""black-sounding"" names these days. Comics make fun of names like ""D'Brickashaw Ferguson"" or ""Tyrasciuses."" Professors conduct <a href=""https://cos.gatech.edu/facultyres/Diversity_Studies/Bertrand_LakishaJamal.pdf"" target=""_blank"">studies on the success rate for job applicants</a> with names like ""Jamal."" Online commentators warn black parents not to give their babies names like ""Keisha,"" while others simply confess -- <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Should-African-American-parents-avoid-giving-their-children-traditionally-African-American-names"" target=""_blank"">as one white man did</a> -- ""I truly don't get the black name thing."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But hardly any attention is paid to people like Francis and other white folks with distinctively black names.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They are those rare white people who can credibly say, ""I'll be black for a minute."" Francis says she's glimpsed racial stereotyping, what it's like to face discrimination and even a degree of acceptance from black people that she may have otherwise never known.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">What she has discovered is that the names of Americans are as segregated as many of their lives. There are names that seem traditionally reserved for whites only, such as Molly, Tanner and Connor. And names favored by black parents, such as Aliyah, DeShawn and Kiara. Add into that mix names that are traditionally Asian, Latino or, say, Muslim.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But when you move through life with a name that violates those racial and ethnic boundaries, Francis has found that people will often treat you as an imposter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The first thing they'll say is, 'That's not your name,' or, 'That's not a name that suits you,'"" she says. ""If I go to a bar, they'll say, 'That's not your name. Let me see your ID.'""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How LaKiesha got her name  </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Francis didn't know much about the baggage attached to her name where she grew up, and still lives: Pitsburg, Ohio. She describes it as a ""super-quiet"" village of more than 300 people, virtually all of them white. The town has one main street and is surrounded by cornfields.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I never realized my name was an African-American name because where I grew up we literally had one African-American child during the whole 12 years I had gone there in school,"" says Francis, a petite woman who exudes a Midwestern friendliness. ""No one said anything. I was oblivious.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">LaDeana Diver, Francis' mother, says she wasn't trying to make a political statement with her daughter's name.  She was trying to settle a disagreement. She and her husband Frank couldn't agree on a name when she became pregnant. They eventually came up with a compromise while vacationing in Florida. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I brought a baby-name book and that was about the only name we agreed on, ""Diver says. ""So she ended up LaKiesha.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From the beginning, there was criticism. Diver says her relatives told her people wouldn't be able to pronounce her daughter's name. They said some might think there were black people in their family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm not prejudiced,"" Diver says. ""A name is a name. To me it doesn't matter. I liked the name. I think it's a pretty name.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Where do distinctively black names come from?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> A name isn't just a name, according to history and social science. Give someone the wrong name and it can become a burden.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That belief is partly why many Irish, Italian and Polish immigrants who came to America in the early 20th century whitened their children's names to avoid persecution and increase their chances of social mobility. It's part of the reason why the Asian actress Chloe Bennet dropped her surname, Wang, to work in Hollywood.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That thinking was validated in <a href=""https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html"" target=""_blank"">a famous experiment</a> in which researchers sent out fictitious resumes in response to actual help-wanted ads. Each resume had identical qualifications, save for one variable: Some applicants had white-sounding names such as ""Brendan"" while others had black-sounding names -- such as ""Lakisha.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The white-sounding applicants were 50% more likely to get calls for interviews than their black-sounding counterparts, researchers found. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Francis says she has experienced this bias firsthand.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's been more than one time that I've been very qualified for a job and I didn't even get a callback, and I think it had to do with my name,"" she says.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">So if black-sounding names are looked at with such suspicion, why do some black people persist in using them? And where did the practice start in the first place?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The answers vary. Some say it began in the late '60s and '70s when some black parents begin giving their kids names that reflected the influence of the Black Power movement and black pride. Some cite the impact of ""Roots,"" the 1977 miniseries. Others say inventive naming has counterparts in the<a href=""https://www.salon.com/2008/08/25/creative_black_names/"" target=""_blank""> ""linguistic and musical inventions"" </a>that produced rap and jazz.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The sheer inventiveness of some black-sounding names has become so extreme, though, that it became the subject of a famous parody by the comic duo Key &amp; Peele. Their ""East/West College Bowl"" skit featured black football players such as ""Quisperny G' Dunzoid Sr"" and ""Tyroil Smoochie-Wallace"" announcing their names during pre-game introductions. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>When a restaurant server refuses to pronounce your name</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Tim Machuga is a software engineer who also knows what it's like to be black for a minute. He is a white man with an African name. People who only know him by name often assume he is African and are startled when a fair-skinned, white guy of Polish descent opens the door.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I run into people who say, 'That's an African name and you pronounced it correctly, Machuga says. ""I always chuckle. Sure I did, because it's my name.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He says the startled expressions he sometimes gets when meeting people face-to-face force him to be more empathetic.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It does make it easier for me to get outside my little shell and empathize with people, but it's always a struggle,"" he says.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But trying to move through life with a white face and a misleading name isn't just a black thing. Talk to Yasmina Bouraoui and you'll hear similar complaints.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She's a white woman with an Arabic name.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bouraoui is the 52-year-old daughter of a Belgian mother and a Tunisian father who lives in Lansing, Michigan. Her name is Arabic, but by law in the US she is considered white -- and she looks white as well. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She recently had an experience that is common to many racial minorities: A white person just ignored her, and her name. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It happened when Bouraoui went to a busy restaurant one evening with a group of family and friends. As they waited outside for a table, a white waiter approached Bouraoui and asked for her name along with the number of people in her party.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Yasmina, party of six,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I need something easier to pronounce,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She repeated her name but he didn't want to try to pronounce it. And then she was no longer there.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He looks at a 12-year-old in our party and he says, 'What's your name?' '' says Bouraoui, a manager with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. ""Now he's just ignoring me.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bouraoui says she has relatives who have whitened their last names to gain more acceptance. But she'd feel as if she had disowned a part of herself if she did the same.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There was, however, one moment when she felt her name was accepted as American.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When Barack Hussein Obama was named president and I no longer had to apologize for a Muslim name,"" she says. ""That was my moment of pride, when I felt normalized. It hit me when he was sworn in. This is America. We can be part of the fabric, too.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her name forced her to step outside her whiteness</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Francis had to learn how to not apologize for her name as well. She says she didn't become aware of its significance until she got married and moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, for a while with her husband Jarrett.  She began waiting tables at a Ruby Tuesday in the city, which has a sizable black population.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's when she started getting double takes at the mention of her first name. Sometimes the reactions stung.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once when she approached a table of black women and told them her name, they looked at her in disbelief.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They took their menus and put them in front of their faces and started laughing,"" she says.

I was a clever psychopath, dirty and drug-addicted whore, guilty until proven innocent. It was a false and unfounded history that lit up people's imagination because it fed fears and fantasies.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On her return to the States in 2011, Knox said she craved a normal life and set about completing her studies at the University of Washington before getting a job as a cub reporter at the West Seattle Herald, writing her memoir ""Waiting to be heard"" and sharing her version of events in a Netflix documentary. As the years have passed, she has continued to try to reshape her public image by forging a career as the host of a true crime podcast as well as an activist campaigning against wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Overnight infamy</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Knox said that despite the notoriety of her case, she still believed the media could be a force for good. It wasn't until she saw Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini in the Netflix documentary that she truly understood his ""genuine and noble motivation"" to find justice for Kercher. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""One day I'd like to meet the real Dr. Mignini, and I hope that when he comes, he will also see that I am not a monster, I simply am Amanda,"" Knox said. ""I have the same hope ... that being brave enough to face you and meet you face to face we can get to some sort of understanding and reconciliation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Because the real justice happens when we see the other people with compassion, when we judge with moderation and when we come back to each other after the pain with the courage of an open heart."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The trip is of course controversial, with criticism coming from the Kercher family's former lawyer. But author and documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson, who became friends with Knox after she contacted him about his book ""So You've Been Publicly Shamed,"" said he was impressed by how she was reclaiming her own story. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I'm sure she has her fair share of trauma and anxiety and so on, but she never lets it get to her.

She works really hard to feel empathy and curiosity and compassion towards everybody -- including her prosecutors.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Shocking murder</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Kercher's slaying in the historic university city of Perugia ignited a <a href=""http://cnn.com/2009/CRIME/03/27/amanda.knox.italy/index.html"" target=""_blank"">media furore</a> in 2007. Within days of the 21-year-old's killing at their shared home, Knox, then 20, was detained for questioning along with her 23-year-old Italian boyfriend of a week, Raffaele Sollecito.

Knox and Sollecito insisted <a href=""http://cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/12/italy.amanda.knox.trial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">they were away from the apartment </a>the night Kercher was killed. During her initial interrogation, Knox also falsely blamed Patrick Lumumba -- the owner of the bar where she worked -- in Kercher's death. He had an alibi and sued Knox for libel, and was awarded 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder in December 2009; Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, and Sollecito to 25. The rulings were just the beginning of a <a href=""http://cnn.com/2011/09/28/world/europe/italy-amanda-knox-timeline/index.html"" target=""_blank"">lengthy legal saga</a>; both convictions were <a href=""https://cnn.com/2015/03/27/europe/amanda-knox/index.html"" target=""_blank"">overturned in 2015</a>.

He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, later reduced to 16 years on appeal. His lawyer told CNN that Guede is now allowed out on day release.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Knox was asked whether she thought there had been justice for Kercher and her family. ""The judicial system cannot promise anybody the ultimate and complete truth. And I'm sorry for them. The judicial system did what it could, the murderer is in jail and so for that they should be satisfied,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Trial by media?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Throughout the court proceedings, newspapers plastered Knox's face across front pages with headlines like ""Sex, lies and stabbings"" and ""Lovers without any inhibitions."" Journalists pounced on any developments.

What was going on with these young women?' and then in the first month started to realize this is not looking the way it looked to me when I got here,"" she told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Burleigh said the fact the Knox case became such a media spectacle was at least in part down to widespread misogynistic attitudes in Italy, and the country's often frenzied coverage of crime stories.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is this way of covering these lurid murders, often involving women or girl children. This was one of those stories. They had a prosecutor feeding [reporters] one-sided information,"" Burleigh explained. ""I met rational people all over who were convinced that Amanda Knox was a killer based a lot on [how it was] depicted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It had everything: A lot of emotion, it had nationalism; it had misogyny ... but really it comes down to young women,"" Burleigh said. ""Women are prey and for there to be a female involved as an alleged murderess -- that was going to get a lot of attention.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Sexism and scrutiny </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://cnn.com/2019/03/31/europe/verona-world-congress-of-families-intl/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Ilaria Ruzza</a>, a feminist and LGBTQ activist based in Verona, said this normalized sexism gets to the heart of why Knox became the poster girl for the case.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Women are not taken seriously in Italy,"" she said. ""It is the type of culture we have,"" in which misogynistic attitudes are ""rooted in our society.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Ruzza said Italian patriarchal attitudes mean women are still expected to conform to gendered stereotypes such as the homemaker and stay-at-home mother. ""We have TV in Italy always showing almost-naked women where their role is to be on the side of the host, like a beautiful stage show. We had 20 years of Berlusconi and that's what he did. He spread this way of objectifying women and that [legacy] is very hard to die.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Certainly, Knox's behavior both in the immediate aftermath of Kercher's death, and during the trial, was heavily scrutinized for clues -- and deemed inappropriate by spectators.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Knox had been filmed kissing Sollecito outside the murder scene, and while at the police station, she reportedly sat on Sollecito's lap, pulling faces.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's very common for very shy people, especially attractive shy people, to be considered stuck up and conceited,"" explained clinical psychiatrist Dale Archer, who added that what others perceive as a ""cold exterior"" is often simply a coping mechanism for the stress an individual is facing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When you put everything together, she was scared to death and did act inappropriately without a doubt,"" he told CNN. ""But I think any young person put in her shoes -- in a foreign country, being interrogated in a foreign language, with a horrible murder that took place and you're being blamed for it -- you can excuse a lot of that behavior.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>'Not looking for revenge'</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When Knox announced on Twitter that she would travel back to Italy, many social media users immediately questioned why. Some suggested she use ""common sense,"" ""think twice"" and called her decision to return ""ridiculous."" Others applauded the move as ""brave,"" ""extraordinary"" and ""strong."" Knox declined CNN's request for an interview.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Francesco Maresca, the former lawyer for the Kercher family, told CNN the trip seemed ""inappropriate.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""She comes to speak about judicial errors, but it was not her case. You can talk of judicial errors when a trial doesn't stand up from the beginning. In her trial, there were as many as three convictions if we also consider the first sentence of the high court. To call it a judicial error is excessive,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Italy's high court first ruled in 2013 that Knox and Sollecito should stand trial for a second time before overturning Knox and Sollecito's second convictions in 2015. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Maresca added that Knox has used the media coverage of her trial ""to her convenience, to become famous, to be able to write the book, to be able to make the film... she exploited it to the full.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Knox's friend Jon Ronson said that like many other people he has met who have been publicly pilloried, she is not looking for revenge, or to bring people down, but instead wants to do good.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's an incredible strength, the fact that she's using all of this to highlight miscarriages of justice,"" he said, adding: ""She just lives her life in an unapologetic way because why should she be apologetic when she's innocent?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He continued, ""At the beginning of the documentary about her, she basically said 'I'm either the world's greatest psychopath or I'm normal and I'm innocent,' and I can tell you having been with Amanda many, many times and having written a book about psychopaths, she's not a psychopath.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Livia Borghese contributed to this report from Rome.  </p>]"

The high pressure also prevents precipitation from forming and leads to clear, sunny skies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Over the past week or two, that high pressure ridge got even stronger as another high pressure front moved in from the eastern U.S. (the one that caused the prolonged hot and dry period in the Southeast earlier this month).</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Melt periods like the current one are not unprecedented; Mote noted previous ones in 2012 as well as 2007 and 2010 (all major melt years).

The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. <br/><br/>CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. A version of this story was published in The Conversation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad Paragraph__isDropCap"">For nearly a century, a massive mural by painter Victor Arnautoff titled ""The Life of Washington"" has lined the hallways of San Francisco's George Washington High School.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It may not be there much longer.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Washington High School's Reflection and Action Working Group -- an ad-hoc committee made up students, school employees and local artists, historians and Native Americans -- believes the mural ""glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, manifest destiny, white supremacy (and) oppression,"" according to a statement <a href=""https://thefrisc.com/at-sfs-washington-high-an-83-year-old-mural-depicting-slaves-and-a-dead-native-american-is-again-b2b576bdf5da"" target=""_blank"">published</a> in local media.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The group reportedly identified two panels as especially offensive. One shows Washington pointing westward next to the body of a dead Native American (pictured above). The other depicts slaves working in the fields of Mount Vernon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Because the work ""traumatizes students and community members,"" the group's statement concluded that ""the impact of this mural is greater than its intent ever was."" They are campaigning for its removal.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The idea that impact matters more than intention has informed debates about everything from microaggressions to cultural appropriation.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But when it comes to art, should impact matter more than intention?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As historians committed to preserving our cultural heritage -- and as citizens invested in the power of art to engage the public -- we see the growing chorus of voices favoring impact over intention as a dangerous trend, one that makes art more vulnerable to rejection, censorship or even destruction.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>A radical work for its time</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">For most members of the Washington High School's Reflection and Action Group, the only message ""The Life of Washington"" sends is one of crushing, dehumanizing oppression.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">What happens, though, when we examine the mural in the context of the life and times of the artist?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Painter Victor Arnautoff was born in 1896 in a small village in present-day Ukraine. He emigrated to San Francisco in 1925, where he joined a leftist art collective. During the Great Depression he was a supporter of workers' strikes and formally joined the Communist Party in 1937. He was even hauled before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1956 for drawing a ""Communist Conspiracy"" cartoon that caricatured then-Vice President Nixon.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In ""The Life of Washington,"" Arnautoff decided to place Native Americans, African Americans and working-class revolutionaries front and center in the four largest panels, relegating Washington to the margins.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The slaves toiling in the Mount Vernon fields highlight a central paradox of America's history: The nation was founded by men who championed liberty, freedom and equality, and yet owned slaves.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Then there's the striking image of the fallen Native American. The mural's detractors say that it dismisses the humanity of indigenous peoples. But why must it necessarily be read as dehumanizing to Native Americans? Could it not instead be seen as throwing into sharp relief the inhumanity of the founding fathers?</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In his biography of Arnautoff, Robert W. Cherny, wrote that the image challenged the fallacy that ""westward expansion had been into largely vacant territory waiting for white pioneers to develop its full potential.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">There's a <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/san-francisco-high-school-may-destroy-historical-murals"" target=""_blank"">strong case</a> to be made that Arnautoff is exposing -- rather than celebrating -- slavery and genocide. As Native American Tamaka Bailey, of the Choctaw Nation, <a href=""https://twitter.com/tamaka3715/status/1127996787283775489"" target=""_blank"">tweeted</a>: the murals ""do not glorify slavery but prove that (Washington) was a slave-owner"" and ""part of the Genocide of First Nation Peoples."" Moreover, those arguing for the mural's removal are overlooking the fact that African Americans are not only portrayed as picking cotton and that Native Americans are not only depicted as victims. Rather Arnautoff is insisting that African Americans and indigenous peoples were key historical actors in the making of the United States.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">That the mural appears in a school is particularly important. For decades, the country's educational institutions perpetuated national myths about American exceptionalism and American history as one long glorious march of forward progress. Up until the 1960s, the standard US history curriculum ignored the country's dark and terrifying history of racial violence, including enslavement and the slaughter of indigenous peoples. So drawing attention to the horrors inflicted on Native Americans and African Americans would have been a radical statement in 1930s America.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Many of those in favor of scrapping the murals seem to believe that merely depicting past atrocities justifies them. In fact, the Action and Reflection Working Group concluded that the mural contravened the San Francisco Unified School District's commitment to ""social justice.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Quite to the contrary. In our view, the ""Life of Washington"" is an invaluable resource for students to engage in a serious and sustained way with social justice issues. It provides a singular opportunity to cultivate historical literacy and to equip students with the skills to analyze and discuss difficult material. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">From new student orientation to classes in art, history and civics, this mural should be formally incorporated into the George Washington High School curriculum. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>Only the latest controversy</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">The controversy over this mural is sadly not an isolated exception.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Over the past several years, there have been dozens of cases where plays, poems, books, prints, paintings, sculptures, installations and other creative works have been shut down, canceled, removed or otherwise censored based on snap judgments, social media swarms, ideologically motivated reasoning and obtuse interpretations of the art in question.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In all of these cases, there has been little to no regard for the aspirations, aims and ambitions of the artists themselves. Their intentions have been treated along a spectrum that runs from indifference to contempt.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">To be clear, we are not saying that an artist's intent is all that matters. How people interpret and respond to a work of art is inseparable from its raison d'etre.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But disregarding the intentions of artists would place every significant creative work with a whiff of controversy in jeopardy because of its ""problematic"" or ""offensive"" content. In a world where intentionality and context are irrelevant, satire and irony would not only be incomprehensible but forbidden.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Mark Twain's frequent invocation of the n-word in ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn""? Just a vicious rehearsal of a profoundly damaging racial slur. Artist Kara Walker's searing paper cuts depicting the horrific violence of slavery in the United States? Nothing more than a celebration of the white domination of black bodies. Keegan-Michael Key's brilliant sketch character Luther who serves as Obama's ""anger translator""? Simply a racist caricature of the ""angry black man.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><h3>What else becomes vulnerable to censorship?</h3></div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Calls to censor ""offensive"" art by committees, petitions or the Twitterverse are especially dangerous. For every case of ""righteous"" censorship that removes works of art that are allegedly racist, sexist, homophobic and so on, there will be scores more censored on the grounds that they are anti-American or offensive to Christians.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">As the American Library Association <a href=""https://ncac.org/news/blog/whose-books-are-banned"" target=""_blank"">reports</a>, the most frequently challenged and banned books are those that contain ""diverse content"" and include characters of color or address themes of sexuality, racism, religion, disability and mental illness. Four out of the top 11 most <a href=""http://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10"" target=""_blank"">challenged or banned books</a> in 2018 were objected to on the basis of their LGBT content. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">""Two Boys Kissing"" -- a 2013 novel centered around the lives of seven gay teenagers -- has made the American Library Association list for several years running, even though The Guardian <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/may/16/review-david-levithan-two-boys-kissing"" target=""_blank"">described</a> it as a ""complex,"" ""intricate"" novel ""so extremely powerful (it) leaves you thinking long, long after you have finished reading it.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Thinking long and hard, alas, is in short supply for members of the ""we are not interested in the artist's intentions"" brigade, to quote a recent <a href=""https://www.change.org/p/mr-president-of-the-french-national-assembly-ladies-and-gentlemen-honorable-members-of-the-national-assembly-say-no-to-racism-on-the-walls-of-the-french-national-assembly"" target=""_blank"">petition</a> calling for the removal of a large fresco, also deemed racist, at France's National Assembly. Ripping art from its context degrades our critical faculties and imprisons us in the present. It smacks of a literal-minded authoritarianism that assumes and indeed insists that a creative work can and must only be read in one way.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">When people refuse to see the contradictions, tensions and ambiguities of art, it becomes disposable. Arnautoff's detractors bring to mind Oscar Wilde's warning that any time a spectator of art tries to ""exercise authority over it and the artist,"" he ""becomes the avowed enemy of Art and of himself.""</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">It took Arnautoff almost a year to complete the mural, painstaking labor that could be erased with a single coat of paint. Not only would this outcome whitewash history, it would also deal a severe blow to our own capacity for creativity and critical thought.</div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad""><em>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) told CNN that the school's superintendent and staff are currently reviewing the Reflection and Action Working Group's request, and a decision has yet to be made regarding the mural's future. </em></div>]"
