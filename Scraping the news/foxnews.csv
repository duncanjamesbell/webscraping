Number theorists recently published technical criterion that shows a significant portion of the hypothesis. Teams behind an eventual solution to the hypothesis are entitled to a $1-million prize.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Did a team of mathematicians just take a big step toward answering a 160-year-old, million-dollar question in mathematics?</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Maybe. The crew did solve a number of other, smaller questions in a field called number theory. And in doing so, they have reopened an old avenue that might eventually lead to an answer to the old question: Is the Riemann hypothesis correct?</p>, <p>The Reimann hypothesis is a fundamental mathematical conjecture that has huge implications for the rest of math. It forms the foundation for many other mathematical ideas — but no one knows if it's true. Its validity has become one of the most famous open questions in mathematics. It's one of seven ""Millennium Problems"" laid out in 2000, with the promise that whoever solves them will win $1 million. (Only one of the problems has since been solved.) [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/26584-5-mind-boggling-math-facts.html"">5 Seriously Mind-Boggling Math Facts</a>]</p>, <p>Back in 1859, a German mathematician named Bernhard Riemann proposed an answer to a particularly thorny math equation. His hypothesis goes like this: The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2. That's a pretty abstract mathematical statement, having to do with what numbers you can put into a particular mathematical function to make that function equal zero. But it turns out to matter a great deal, most importantly regarding questions of how often you'll encounter prime numbers as you count up toward infinity.</p>, <p>We'll come back to the details of the hypothesis later. But the important thing to know now is that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, it answers a lot of questions in mathematics.</p>, <p>""So often in number theory, what ends up happening is if you assume the Riemann hypothesis [is true], you're then able to prove all kinds of other results,"" Lola Thompson, a number theorist at Oberlin College in Ohio, who wasn't involved in this latest research, said.</p>, <p>Often, she told Live Science, number theorists will first prove that something is true if the Riemann hypothesis is true. Then they'll use that proof as a sort of stepping stone toward a more intricate proof, which shows that their original conclusion is true whether or not the Riemann hypothesis is true.</p>, <p>The fact that this trick works, she said, convinces many mathematicians that the Riemann hypothesis must be true.</p>, <p>But the truth is that nobody knows for sure.</p>, <p>So how did this small team of mathematicians seem to bring us closer toward a solution?</p>, <p>""What we have done in our paper,"" said Ken Ono, a number theorist at Emory University and co-author of the new proof, ""is we revisited a very technical criterion which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis … and we proved a large part of it. We proved a large chunk of this criterion.""</p>, <p>A ""criterion which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis,"" in this case, refers to a separate statement that is mathematically equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.</p>, <p>It's not obvious at first glance why the two statements are so connected. (The criterion has to do with something called the ""hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials."") But in the 1920s, a Hungarian mathematician named George Pólya proved that if this criterion is true, then the Riemann hypothesis is true — and vice versa. It's an old proposed route toward proving the hypothesis, but one that had been largely abandoned.</p>, <p>Ono and his colleagues, in a paper published May 21 in the journal <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/20/1902572116"">Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences</a> (PNAS), proved that in many, many cases, the criterion is true.</p>, <p>But in math, many is not enough to count as a proof. There are still some cases where they don't know if the criterion is true or false.</p>, <p>""It's like playing a million-number Powerball,"" Ono said. ""And you know all the numbers but the last 20. If even one of those last 20 numbers is wrong, you lose. … It could still all fall apart.""</p>, <p>Researchers would need to come up with an even more advanced proof to show the criterion is true in all cases, thereby proving the Riemann hypothesis. And it's not clear how far away such a proof is, Ono said.</p>, <p>In terms of the Riemann hypothesis, it's tough to say how big a deal this is. A lot depends on what happens next.</p>, <p>""This [criterion] is just one of many equivalent formulations of the Riemann hypothesis,"" Thompson said.</p>, <p>In other words, there are a lot of other ideas that, like this criterion, would prove that the Riemann hypothesis is true if they themselves were proven.</p>, <p>""So, it's really hard to know how much progress this is, because on the one hand it's made progress in this direction. But, there's so many equivalent formulations that maybe this direction isn't going to yield the Riemann hypothesis. Maybe one of the other equivalent theorems instead will, if someone can prove one of those,"" Thompson said.</p>, <p>If the proof turns up along this track, then that will likely mean Ono and his colleagues have developed an important underlying framework for solving the Riemann hypothesis. But if it turns up somewhere else, then this paper will turn out to have been less important.</p>, <p>Still, mathematicians are impressed.</p>, <p>""Although this remains far away from proving the Riemann hypothesis, it is a big step forward,"" Encrico Bombieri, a Princeton number theorist who was not involved in the team's research, wrote in an accompanying May 23 <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/22/1906804116"">PNAS</a> article. ""There is no doubt that this paper will inspire further fundamental work in other areas of number theory as well as in mathematical physics.""</p>, <p>(Bombieri won a Fields Medal — the most prestigious prize in mathematics — in 1974, in large part for work related to the Riemann hypothesis.)</p>, <p>I promised we'd get back to this. Here's the Riemann hypothesis again: The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2.</p>, <p>Let's break that down according to how Thompson and Ono explained it.</p>, <p>First, what's the Riemann zeta function?</p>, <p>In math, a function is a relationship between different mathematical quantities. A simple one might look like this: y = 2x.</p>, <p>The Riemann zeta function follows the same basic principles. Only it's much more complicated. Here's what it looks like.</p>, <p>It's a sum of an infinite sequence, where each term — the first few are 1/1^s, 1/2^s and 1/3^s — is added to the previous terms. Those ellipses mean the series in the function keeps going on like that, forever.</p>, <p>Now we can answer the second question: What is a zero of the Riemann zeta function?</p>, <p>This is easier. A ""zero"" of the function is any number you can put in for x that causes the function to equal zero.</p>, <p>Next question: What's the ""real part"" of one of those zeros, and what does it mean that it equals 1/2?</p>, <p>The Riemann zeta function involves what mathematicians call ""complex numbers."" A complex number looks like this: a+b*i.</p>, <p>In that equation, ""a"" and ""b"" stand for any real numbers. A real number can be anything from minus 3, to zero, to 4.9234, pi, or 1 billion. But there's another kind of number: imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers emerge when you take the square root of a negative number, and they're important, showing up in all kinds of mathematical contexts. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/58249-surprising-facts-about-pi.html"">10 Surprising Facts About Pi</a>]</p>, <p>The simplest imaginary number is the square root of -1, which is written as ""i."" A complex number is a real number (""a"") plus another real number (""b"") times i. The ""real part"" of a complex number is that ""a.""</p>, <p>A few zeros of the Riemann zeta function, negative integers between -10 and 0, don't count for the Reimann hypothesis. These are considered ""trivial"" zeros because they’re real numbers, not complex numbers. All the other zeros are ""non-trivial"" and complex numbers.</p>, <p>The Riemann hypothesis states that when the Riemann zeta function crosses zero (except for those zeros between -10 and 0), the real part of the complex number has to equal to 1/2.</p>, <p>That little claim might not sound very important. But it is. And we may be just a teensy bit closer to solving it.</p>, <p><em>Originally published on <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/"">Live Science</a>.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Volunteers are at the frontline managing Philadelphia’s exploding cat crisis</p>, <p class=""speakable"">PHILADELPHIA -- Every summer, Julie Crowe's back patio becomes overrun with stray cats. They climb on her barbecue grill, feast on her garden and leave a putrid stench that forces her to keep the windows of her home shut.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">No amount of eggshells, chili peppers or bleach keeps the felines out of her trash bins. Just last week, she discovered a litter of six kittens and a momma cat living off of leftovers.</p>, <p>“I got an estimate to try to enclose the patio, and it's $3,000,” said Crowe, “I don’t have it and shouldn’t have to pay it to enjoy my own backyard.”</p>, <p>Philadelphia’s feral cat population has long been an issue. But in recent years, the number of stray cats roaming the streets has exploded, with hundreds of colonies clustered in vacant lots, abandoned buildings or neighborhood yards.</p>, <p>Philadelphia is now home to nearly half a million stray or <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature"" target=""_blank"">feral cats</a>. And residents say they have had it.</p>, <p>""An unmanageable situation,"" said Alley Cagnazzi, coordinator of the city's Animal Care and Control Team, or ACCT, who said her department alone cannot handle the uptick of feral cats.</p>, <p>
      Feral cats recently trapped in South Philadelphia awaiting transportation to ACCT to be neutered.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Talia Kirkland / (Fox News))</span></p>, <p>As cities across the country began a kinder, gentler approach to the feral cat problem -- the felines years ago were immediately euthanized but many places now spay them – some places began seeing a growing litter of stray cats. Shelters in Philadelphia are crammed with feral cats and, because adoption is not an option, the untamed animals mostly roamed free.</p>, <p>""Every single shelter in the city would be overflowing, there is literally not enough space,"" said Cagnazzi.</p>, <p>But now cities like Philly have turned to neighborhood “volunteers” to serve on the front lines of the war to control the feral cat problem.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-man-baited-cats-fishhooks"" target=""_blank"">PENNSYLVANIA MAN ALLEGEDLY USED FISHHOOKS, POLE IN GRUESOME 'FISHING FOR CATS' PLAN</a></strong></p>, <p>Honorary soldier Jean Van Sciver, or neighborhood ""cat-mom,"" responded quickly to the city's call for help. Van Sciver, who unexpectedly died after her interview with Fox News, said she had taken care of a few hundred cats over the last few years.</p>, <p>Every evening after work, she would set out paper plates loaded with wet and dry kibble, and watch from her window as the cats tip-toed into her yard to eat. She pointed out each of “her” cats have a clipped left ear indicating it had been spayed or neutered. Van Sciver had trapped them herself and, once fixed, she treated them as quasi-pets.</p>, <p>
      Jean Van Sciver, a colony ""caretaker"" feeds her feral cats through her window.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Talia Kirkland / (Fox News))</span></p>, <p>""I'm not going to see them starve,"" she said, “They live here, they are just [my] outside cats.”</p>, <p>Colony caretakers, like Van Sciver, are community volunteers who help trap strays and get them fixed. In Philadelphia, this is a free service provided by ACCT, which will then return the cats to their neighborhoods or colony caretakers in a process known as ""trap, neuter, release,"" or TNR.</p>, <p>Though the program’s impact isn’t crystal clear, some believe it can make a difference.</p>, <p>“There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding TNR and, in order for community volunteers to be successful, education and support are key,” said Karen O'Rourke, president of Stray Cat Relief Fund, or SCRF, a volunteer-run, non-profit providing shelter, and medication to the felines.</p>, <p>According to the Humane Society, for decades feral cats were not much of a municipality concern. Animal control officers would round up strays only after a complaint, a practice that typically ended in euthanasia. The problem with that system, O’Rourke said, is that too many colonies were going uncontrolled, and cats that were taken off the street were swiftly replaced. Females can have litters every 63 days.</p>, <p>Nationally, the TNR program has been adopted by more than a dozen states, including California, where recent wildfires exposed hundreds of strays, and in cities like Chicago, where it is credited with reducing the feral cat population.</p>, <p>The most famous test case for TNR came in Newburyport, Mass., a tourist town where hundreds of stray cats hung out along the waterfront, dining on Dumpster scraps. Volunteers set out humane traps, and eventually managed to get every cat sterilized.</p>, <p>The population steadily dropped, and in 2009, reportedly the last feral waterfront cat died at the age of 16. Cats only live about five years after being spayed.</p>, <p>However, some have objected to program, saying outdoor cats are a menace to birds and other wildlife. They claim the effort to be more compassionate to wild cats has come at a steep price.</p>, <p>A 2012 study co-authored by Peter Marra, the chief of the Smithsonian’s migratory bird center, found that an estimated 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion small mammals in the U.S. are killed annually by free-roaming cats.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/science/australia-feral-cats-poisoned-sausages"" target=""_blank"">AUSTRALIAN OFFICIALS KILLING MILLIONS OF FERAL CATS WITH POISONED SAUSAGES</a></strong></p>, <p>
      Pretty deadly: Feral cats have contributed to the extinction of dozens of Australian mammal species.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme)</span></p>, <p>In Philadephia, the city’s parks department has not taken an official stance. In a recent interview with Philadelphia’s WHYY, city officials said their main objective is not the welfare of feral cats, but to maintain safe and accessible park spaces for city residents.</p>, <p>The city posted an article on its website written by environmental planner Tony Croasdale that said the kitties are not as innocent as they look.</p>, <p>“These outside cats will kill hundreds to thousands of wild prey in their lifetime,” the article said. ""While it is understandable that some people have a strong emotional attachment towards outside cats since cats are such a popular pet, many other people feel similarly towards wildlife.”</p>, <p>More than 60,000 feral cats were sterilized through the Philadelphia's TNR program in 2017.  Though the city is still overrun by cats, some say the practice appears to be working.</p>, <p>""Boots on the ground,"" said Kelsey Lauder, a volunteer with the Stray Cat Relief Fund. ""It's going to take neighbors in their back alleys working together before we see any significant change.""</p>, <p>Lauder said her organization is getting the friendly kittens off the street and putting them into homes, and the neutering and spaying efforts are reducing the population.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>O’Rourke said sterilizing even a single feral cat can make a huge difference in controlling the overall population, and can even improve a cat's behavior.</p>, <p>“Fixed and vaccinated cats are healthier,” said O’Rourke. “They are also less aggressive so no more fighting, howling and spraying. And ultimately one more fixed cat means one less litter of kittens.”</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

The sprawling report is 448 pages long, however. In his nine-minute address, Mueller quite consciously highlighted the portions of the report that fuel the Democrats’ calls for impeachment.</p>, <p>Mueller was adamant that he did not make a finding on whether President Trump should be charged with obstruction of justice because the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued guidance forbidding the indictment of a sitting president. I've argued before that he is completely wrong on this, but that is beside the point.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>What matters is that Mueller can be fairly understood to be saying he believed President Trump committed obstruction of justice. That is not the only possible interpretation, but it is the most likely interpretation.</p>, <p>Mueller said Wednesday that if he had concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction, he would have said so (as he did with collusion). He then emphasized that he did not say so. That strongly implies that he believes the evidence is sufficient (notwithstanding that the attorney general has found otherwise). Mueller added that, in deciding not to allege obstruction even though the evidence was arguably sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he relied on the OLC guidance. Finally, he deduced from this, and from his understanding of the Constitution, that in our system it is for Congress, not federal prosecutors, to deal with presidential misconduct.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-press-conference-impeachment-politics-democrats/""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</strong></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/andrew-mccarthy""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

There’s no doubt about it.</p>, <p>Last week, to remedy some of that struggle, President Trump announced a $16-billion-dollar aid package for those farmers impacted by this trade scuffle with China.</p>, <p>“We are gonna do a subsidy program….everybody is asking for money…just give us a flat table…nobody can compete with us…we are giving them a level playing field…giving them that level playing field that’s so important,"" said Trump.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout but they would like a level playing field and you can make that happen... easily. </p>, <p>It’s true, our farmers and ranchers don’t want a hand out at all.</p>, <p>They want a level playing field. Few D.C. politicians understand that because they are used to patronizing Americans with lip service and a check.</p>, <p>Now let me be clear, I understand why President Trump issued this aid, the second round since July of last year when the government allocated $12 billion to offset the plight.</p>, <p>Do I think a multi-billion dollar farm subsidy or bailout will fix the problem? No.</p>, <p>But President Trump had to do something to shut up the beltway Democrats and media hacks who launched an anti-Trump smear campaign blaming him for farmer’s woes.</p>, <p>Yes, the trade negotiations with China have certainly been a factor BUT consider this: corn, soybean and wheat prices began their decline in mid-2012, long before Trump took office and imposed tariffs.</p>, <p>Why? Well, there's no single answer for that but overproduction had a lot to do with it.</p>, <p>Our farmers have been planting and preparing enough crops to feed the world and yes, trade uncertainty threw a wrench in the process.</p>, <p>But here’s something else to consider -- although our imports on grain, corn, and soybeans are indeed very low, why are we importing AT ALL?</p>, <p>If we produce enough of those crops to feed the world AND have an overproduction surplus, why import at all, even a tiny amount?</p>, <p>Guess what else we import a lot of in recent years -- beef products.</p>, <p>Follow the money. American cattle ranches rely on American farmers for feed. The American cattleman has been royally screwed over by foreign beef imports with many ranchers run completely out of business.</p>, <p>In fact, according to data compiled by American Cattlemen advocacy group RCALF, we have eliminated over 175,000 cattle farms and ranches since 1994, the year we entered NAFTA.</p>, <p>Consequently, we have 8.5 million fewer cattle today than we had in 1994. Those missing cows would be eating a lot of corn.</p>, <p>Also, if we were raising and feeding the half-a-million cattle that we import each year for immediate slaughter, there would be additional demand for crops that could have fed those animals, right here in the U.S.</p>, <p>Fewer American cattle ranchers leads to less demand for American feed and hence, we now have an over-abundance of corn, grain, and wheat.</p>, <p>A surplus drives down prices and hits our American farmers in the pocketbook. It is all linked.</p>, <p>The USDA is planning a $100 million trade promotion program for livestock producers, yet, if you look at this latest $16-billion-dollar farm bailout, there are allowances for crops, dairy and hogs but NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH for American cattle ranchers.</p>, <p>President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout either but they would like that level playing field and you can make that happen, easily.</p>, <p>Under regulations Trump inherited from the Obama administration, the beef you find in a local grocery store can be labeled ‘Product of USA’ as long as it was packaged here. So it could have been born and raised virtually anywhere. </p>, <p>There is hope, with a stroke of a pen, President Trump could reinstate country of origin labeling on beef products so consumers know where their meat is from.</p>, <p>This simple action would be worth more than a billion-dollar handout or subsidy from Uncle Sam.</p>, <p>This farm aid might be a short-term bandaid for American farmers but what about our American ranchers?</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>President Trump, “Made in the USA” used to mean something and you have the power to bring it back.

Yet, Pelosi is the most uncomfortable. She is caught between progressives who want the president impeached yesterday and moderates who don’t want any discussion of impeachment at all.</p>, <p>The statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday certainly won’t help matters. In fact, his unwillingness to testify on Capitol Hill is only going to further enrage progressives who believe that the Trump administration is stonewalling their investigation.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mary-anne-marsh-trump-the-extremely-stable-genius-who-cant-resist-taking-pelosis-bait"" target=""_blank"">MARY ANNE MARSH: TRUMP IS THE ‘EXTREMELY STABLE GENIUS’ WHO CAN’T RESIST TAKING PELOSI’S BAIT</a></strong></p>, <p>Now, the Speaker and her leadership team are trying to prevent an ugly civil war in the caucus.</p>, <p>It is obvious that Speaker Pelosi wants to destroy the President, without having to actually impeach him. Formally impeaching Trump would endanger the Democratic moderates she needs to retain control of the House. Worse, in the Senate, the President will win an overwhelming vote to reject the articles of impeachment.</p>, <p>If the House impeaches the president, progressives will celebrate a symbolic victory but it will be pyrrhic – at least politically. Republicans will be energized by beating back an attempt by Democrats to remove their commander in chief.</p>, <p>Looking to the 2020 election, a failed impeachment could ensure another term for Donald Trump, a missed attempt by Democrats to take the Senate, and a threat to the Democratic control of the House. The president is aware of this situation, which is why his administration refuses to comply with subpoenas from House Committees controlled by Democrats. He is daring them to impeach him.</p>, <p>Yet, no matter how many times Pelosi explains this scenario to progressives in her caucus, it will fall on deaf ears. This is because the progressive Democrats are worried that if they fail to secure an impeachment vote, it will cost them politically. After all, back home, their voters demand impeachment.</p>, <p>Without an impeachment vote, progressives worry they could get a primary challenger; a candidate who could promise to impeach the president when elected to Congress.</p>, <p>This dynamic where Pelosi opposes impeachment to help Democratic moderates stay in office, but puts progressives at risk of losing their primary election, is an untenable long-term position.</p>, <p>Pelosi needs a way to pacify the progressives demanding the president be removed from office, while not going down the impeachment road. Here is a way she can do both:</p>, <p>If progressives on Capitol Hill can convince 15 Republican Senators to agree to vote for impeachment, Pelosi should agree to bring up articles of impeachment, and that she will work with progressives to try and get the five more Republican Senators constitutionally-required to remove the president from the White House. </p>, <p>The campaign to convince those Republican Senators can be partially waged through investigations, and going to court to force the Trump administration to comply with subpoenas.</p>, <p>By offering this compromise, the Speaker is not refusing the impeach the president. But rather, making a promise to impeach Donald Trump only if there is a real chance that he will be removed from office.</p>, <p>Keep in mind, as of today, not a single Republican Senator would vote in favor of ending Donald Trump’s presidency. The only Republican who believes the president’s actions investigated by Robert Mueller are impeachable is Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan. But he serves in the House and has no vote in the Senate, where the president’s fate will ultimately be decided.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>When Congressman Amash made his pronouncement, not a single other Republican – even those who viscerally dislike the president – followed. No surprise, the president enjoys a 90 percent approval rate from Republicans.</p>, <p>Speaker Pelosi, by agreeing to impeach the president only if there is a realistic chance the Senate will convict him, will not pacify all of the progressives in Congress or their voters back home. But, it can slow the impeachment talk. It also gives progressives on Capitol Hill some political cover by forcing progressive voters to acknowledge reality: they cannot remove the president from office unless they can first convince a lot of Republican Senators to do the same.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/gary-meltz"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GARY MELTZ</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"" target=""_blank"">Special counsel Robert Mueller</a> spoke Wednesday, breaking his silence on the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Russia probe</a> and his report about the investigation of Russian interference in America’s elections.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The special counsel not only announced that he will retire from the Department of Justice but he will no longer be speaking on the matter. Mueller’s words and tone were quite different than that of the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/william-barr"" target=""_blank"">Attorney General, William Barr</a>. Mueller clearly struck a sharper edge with his words than many of us read in his 448-page long report. As former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said: Mueller’s statement “definitely contradicts what the attorney general said when he summarized Mueller’s report""</p>, <p>As both sides, left and right, Democrat and Republican waited with bated breath for the special counsel's statement; with these few sentences, he handed the Democrats a gift and gave them the green light to stay the course with investigations, and perhaps, even impeachment.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-rally-behind-mueller-statement-poised-to-impeach"" target=""_blank"">DEMS RAMP UP CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AFTER MUELLER SPEAKS OUT ON RUSSIA PROBE</a></strong></p>, <p>Mueller stated: “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” Even though this sentence is in his written report, the fact that the special counsel chose to emphasize that point is quite telling. It’s not only what he said, but what he did not say; nothing about the president being exonerated, no utterance of ‘no collusion, no obstruction.’</p>, <p>Mueller went on to explain that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel’s office, but the opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted is ‘unconstitutional.’ In this statement, and reference that there are other authorities with power over the president, Mueller was in my opinion, very clear; only Congress has the power to punish a sitting president. And with that, it’s game on for Congress.</p>, <p>But perhaps the most important words from the special counsel were his last: “I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments – that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election and that allegation deserves the attention of every American. “</p>, <p>So in stating that the report does not say the president did not commit a crime and that this deserves the attention of an investigation and adds further that there were multiple systematic attempts to interfere in the investigation; this is code speak for: Congress do your job!</p>, <p>And Congress was listening.</p>, <p>Shortly after Mueller’s statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler tweeted:</p>, <p>“Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump…and we will do so. No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.”</p>, <p>And with these words from the special counsel, ""The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing,"" it not only signaled game on for Congress to investigate further; but for some, this was Mueller essentially referring Congress to impeach the president.</p>, <p>Shortly after Mueller spoke, some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates weighed in:</p>, <p>Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said: ""I think it’s a fair inference from what we heard in that press conference that Bob Mueller was essentially referring impeachment to the United States Congress.”</p>, <p>Pete Buttigieg said: “This is as close to an impeachment referral as you could get under the circumstances.”</p>, <p>And Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: ""Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.""</p>, <p>Congress has the Constitutional responsibility of oversight of the executive branch. It’s not only within their realm of power to conduct further investigations but it is their duty to the American people. But do the American people want further investigations? Or impeachment?</p>, <p>Earlier Wednesday on Fox News Channel, Andrew McCarthy, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York said:</p>, <p>""I think it changes things in the sense that the Democrats who wanted impeachment are going to be more aggressive, more forward on that. Now, where it goes, because impeachment is political and not legal, really depends on what the polls say. And I think if the polls say the public has had it with this and wants to move on, then there’ll be a lot of blather about impeachment, but it probably won’t go further than that. If it gets some traction, we’re going to see more proceedings and more hearings.""</p>, <p>But I’m not so sure McCarthy is right.</p>, <p>Polls show that the majority of Americans are against impeaching the president. But a majority of Democrats who voted for those in Congress and made the Democrats a majority in the House do want impeachment.</p>, <p>The problem is, as I have stated in other Fox News op-eds, that impeachment will not remove the president from office, especially with a Republican-controlled Senate. And at last count, there were between 34 and 40 Democrats who are pushing for impeachment, certainly not the majority, and only one Republican.</p>, <p>I say again, impeaching the president could backfire for Democrats politically as it did for Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton. So impeaching President Trump would be more symbolic and could turn those voters on the fence off, or those voters expecting Democrats to write legislation regarding health care, immigration, climate change, etc., leading them to stay home -- or worse for Democrats -- voting for Trump and giving him a second term.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>With Mueller’s words Wednesday, much like in his written report, he passed the buck. With his written report he passed the decision of charging the president to the attorney general’s office. With his words, he passed the task of investigating these matters further with Congress. It’s as if he said, I’ve done my job, now you run with it.</p>, <p>Now we will see if Congress runs with the will of the majority of Americans, or with the will of a segment of the Democratic Party.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/leslie-marshall"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Teachers told to favor black students in 'racial equity' training; reaction from National Review contributing editor Deroy Murdock.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Democrat and <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-de-blasio-inept-presidential-bid-judge-nap"" target=""_blank"">New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> and Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza are operating a truly Orwellian scheme wherein the search for “racial equity” requires teachers, principals, and superintendents to treat black students unequally from whites. Specifically, blacks are presumed to be downtrodden victims, while whites constitute a privileged, comfortable elite – never mind any black or white person’s actual circumstances.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Courageous Conversations is a mandatory program to expunge the “implicit bias” of every Department of Education employee. It does not regard people as individuals within <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york"" target=""_blank"">New York City’s government school system</a>. Rather everyone is evaluated as a member of one racial group or another. And on that basis alone, all sorts of conclusions instantly emerge: White skin means a life filled with jackpots. Black skin signifies an existence rife with snake eyes.</p>, <p>This dermis <em>über alles</em> approach is the dictionary definition of racism.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/de-blasio-on-trump-i-get-under-his-skin-probes-will-lead-to-impeachment"" target=""_blank""><strong>DE BLASIO ON TRUMP: I 'GET UNDER HIS SKIN,' PROBES WILL 'LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT'</strong></a></p>, <p>City Hall and the Department of Education are spending $23 million in taxpayer funds to force school employees to fetishize their racial differences and their supposed inner bigotry. New teachers in New York average $56,711 annually. So, this haul could finance 405 new teachers. Instead, it pays to pick at racial scabs until they bleed.</p>, <p>While this blood is metaphorical, the pain is not.</p>, <p>As Saturday’s New York Post reported, a group of school superintendents met in spring 2018 for a racial-training session. They discussed the question, “What lived experience inspires you as a leader to fight for equity?”</p>, <p>A Jewish superintendent noted that her grandmother hid in a Polish forest while fleeing the Nazis. Her grandfather, she recalled, spent six years in a labor and concentration camp and watched helplessly as his mother and sister were executed.</p>, <p>“My grandparents taught me to understand the dangers of ‘targeted racism’ or the exclusion of any group, and the importance of equity for all people,” the Jewish employee told her associates. “This is my core value as an educator.”</p>, <p>As she told the Post: “At the break, I stood up and, to my surprise, I was verbally attacked by a black superintendent in front of my colleagues. She said ‘This is not about being Jewish! It’s about black and brown boys of color only. You better check yourself.’”</p>, <p>“I was traumatized,” said the Jewish educator. “It was like 1939 all over again.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">This stipulation of black failure is a recipe for black failure. If black kids hear from their teachers, principals, and school officials that white racism is as ubiquitous as atmospheric nitrogen, then why bother trying to prosper? Far more sensible – this grim, race-crazed illogic goes – to surrender and accept a life of government dependency, indolence, and worse.</p>, <p>Carranza has railed against “white-supremacy culture.” According to Department of Education training materials, this outlook includes such allegedly Anglocentric concepts as “objectivity,” “individualism,” and “worship of the written word.”</p>, <p>If this “disrupt and dismantle” initiative (as its supporters call it) were implemented in Birmingham, Alabama in 1965 or 1970, one might see the need to help people exorcise their inner racial demons within spitting distance of segregation.</p>, <p>But LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – nearly 55 years ago. And the men and women being marched through the de Blasio-Carranza racial re-education camp work 961 miles north of Birmingham – for the New York City school system! Overwhelmingly, these are liberal Democrats who did the wave when Obama won and wept in the fetal position when Hillary lost.</p>, <p>These teachers-union and principals-union members already are among America’s most racially correct individuals. So, de Blasio and Carranza are spending tens of millions of tax dollars to help them excise their inner Jim Crows?</p>, <p>The mayor and chancellor may have to shell out $90 million, now that three white women filed suit yesterday, claiming that they were demoted in favor of less-qualified minority personnel. “If you draw a paycheck from DOE,” the suit says Carranza hectored employees last June, “get on board with my equity platform or leave.”</p>, <p>As part of what this litigation calls Carranza’s “totalitarian threat,” Dermisa Amante, CEO of Disruptive Equity Education Project, reportedly scored $175,000 to keep Gotham’s educators thinking about race – non-stop.</p>, <p>“You are going to have to talk about your power and your privilege,” she told Department of Education brass in February, according to the Post. “This might feel dangerous because you are going to have to talk about race daily.”</p>, <p>Amante also explained that “racial equity” requires racial inequity. She told school administrators:</p>, <p>“If I had a poor white male student, and I had a middle-class black boy, I would actually put my equitable strategies and interventions into that middle-class black boy because, over the course of his lifetime, he will have less access and less [sic] opportunities than that poor white boy.”</p>, <p>Really?</p>, <p>If this race-driven dearth of black-male life prospects is so axiomatic, how did neurosurgeon and HUD Secretary Ben Carson, M.D. make it?</p>, <p>How did former American Express CEO Ken Chenault make it?</p>, <p>How did astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson make it?</p>, <p>How did Motown founder Barry Gordy make it?</p>, <p>How did Academy Award-winning cineaste Spike Lee make it?</p>, <p>How did CNN anchor Don Lemon make it?</p>, <p>How did Fox Business Network host Charles Payne make it?</p>, <p>How did Tony Award-winning actor Denzel Washington make it?</p>, <p>How did author and Fox News contributor Juan Williams make it?</p>, <p>Conversely, how have so many anonymous white men on opioids <em>not</em> made it?</p>, <p>One of Carranza’s indoctrination sessions unveiled a “racial advantage hierarchy” with whites at the top, blacks at the bottom, and Americans of Asian descent not even mentioned. Why? According to attendee Ingrid Flinn, they supposedly enjoy “proximity to white privilege” and “benefit from white supremacy.”</p>, <p>This stipulation of black failure is a recipe for black failure. If black kids hear from their teachers, principals, and school officials that white racism is as ubiquitous as atmospheric nitrogen, then why bother trying to prosper? Far more sensible – this grim, race-crazed illogic goes – to surrender and accept a life of government dependency, indolence, and worse.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>New York’s schools should ignore this self-destructive rubbish and, instead, study black success and learn to duplicate it. Step one is to achieve educational excellence.</p>, <p>Finally, rather than breed suspicion by assuming implicit bias, why not assume implicit <em>decency</em>? If someone says or does something racist, help him see the light. If he persists, shun him. But otherwise, encourage people to get along and learn to love others like and unlike them via respect, friendship, and affection – not rage, fear, and animus.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/deroy-murdock"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Mueller explained that he will not testify before Congress. Why? Because he's got nothing more to say. It's all in that 448-page report, which you can read online if you feel like it.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">So why bother giving this speech in the first place? Well, Robert Mueller had a message he wanted to deliver. Not a message for you or me or the rest of the audience at home, but a message aimed at a very small group of elected officials in Washington.</p>, <p>Years of investigations could not produce a criminal charge against Donald Trump, but Mueller suggested Congress could still step in, saying, ""The opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/tucker-carlson"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.</strong></a></p>, <p>""A process other than the criminal justice system.""

Now it is up to Congress to hold this President accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""</p>, <p>Beto O'Rourke, meanwhile, took a break from skateboarding to agree. ""There must be consequences,"" he wrote. ""Accountability and justice. The only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>And then from their seats on cable news sets across New York City, America's opinion generating class applauded heartily:</p>, <p><em>Ari Melber, MSNBC host: This was vintage Bob Mueller, no questions, no bull.</em></p>, <p><em>Frank Figliuzzi, MSNBC national security analyst: He speaks in measured, but clear tones and style. </em></p>, <p><em>Glenn Kirschner, former federal prosecutor: That's the man Bob Mueller is. He is precise. He is factual. He is accurate. The man doesn't know the definition of hyperbole. </em></p>, <p><em>Chris Matthews, MSNBC host: I think a lot of us have been very supportive of Mueller and what he's done. He has worked very hard and done a really good job. </em></p>, <p>Man, can they suck up when they want to! A man never stands so tall when he stoops to kiss a butt. That's their motto. It's unbelievable.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">When Robert Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>But you may be slightly confused, listening to all this. Democrats are demanding impeachment, and the press strongly agrees with that. They love Robert Mueller. But what will the crime be, exactly? What would the charges be in an impeachment proceeding? Would it be Russian collusion, the core charge?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Well, as Mueller himself conceded, there's no evidence that ever happened.</p>, <p>""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,"" he said during his public statement. ""This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.""</p>, <p>""Insufficient evidence."" In other words, there was no crime. That's how it works. The same is true for obstruction, by Mueller's own admission. After two years, he and his subordinates were unable to find a criminal act.</p>, <p>""The report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president,"" Mueller said. ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""</p>, <p>""Under longstanding department policy, a present president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,"" Mueller added. ""That is unconstitutional. The Special Counsel's Office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""</p>, <p>Yes, got that. We knew that, in fact.</p>, <p>And just to be clear, prosecutors in civilized countries don't prove people innocent. They don't need to do that. That's the standing presumption that all of us have by virtue of our citizenship. Instead, prosecutors look for evidence of guilt, and if there is no evidence of guilt, a person is declared not guilty. That's how our system works.</p>, <p>So when Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>Yet, Mueller would clearly like to see the president impeached anyway. Democrats are likely to take him up on that.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on May 29, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">It’s clear the president wants to deal roughly with China but consider the cost. Contrary to Trump’s statements that China pays the tariffs, American consumers bear the brunt.</p>, <p class=""advert-txt"">Advertisement</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">One estimate by academics from Yale, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Columbia calculate that tariffs already added $69 billion in annual costs for Americans consumers, before the latest escalation. The National Bureau of Economic Research says that an all-out trade war could eventually cost more than $300 billion.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Estimates indicate that the average American household will pay at least $500 extra this year because of tariffs already imposed. Escalation to an all-out trade war will raise that tab to $2,200.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Jobs will be hit hard, too, with upwards of 455,000 jobs put at risk because of this costly conflict. In the end, tariffs hit consumers hardest and compel American firms to pull back on expansion and innovation. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">China’s retaliatory tariffs will also negatively affect America’s energy exports to China. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. oil exports ultimately plummeted in 2018 since China’s importers essentially shunned American energy producers. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The retaliatory tariffs will also jeopardize American investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and consequently restrict America’s contribution to the growing LNG market. The damage to farm exports is well known and at best the administration can offer temporary relief through stockpiling programs.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">To be sure, the U.S. must have a strategy for China. But China does not pose an “existential threat” to America. If it did, an approach much stronger than tariffs would be warranted.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Making China an enemy is a sure way to isolate America from much of Asia and Africa, as well as parts of Latin America and Europe. That’s not a prescription for ensuring that the United States remains the indispensable global power. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The solutions? America’s best answer to Chinese competition is a strong U.S. economy that promotes innovation. We were headed in that direction through meaningful tax reform.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Specific reprisals to answer Chinese trade and investment misbehavior are the right response, not broad protectionist tariffs. We can afford no further escalation of the tariff war with China. Instead of a fresh tariff volley, President Trump should encourage free and fair trade with China through a comprehensive agreement.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">If China does not fulfill its side of the new bargain, President Trump can target offending Chinese companies – private or state-owned – with specific reprisals rather than renewing all-out tariffs that injure American firms and workers.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">In the coming days, the president has a significant opportunity to calm American markets and ensure that the U.S. economy continues to prosper.

      <span class=""copyright"">(AP Photo)</span></p>, <p>“The ripple of one crime like this has been phenomenal,” Wrenn continued. “The first responders that had to remove the children from the oil tanks — they’ll never be the same. Some of the investigators I know had struggled to return to their jobs and go about investigations the same way.”</p>, <p>The terrifying turn of events first occurred with the disappearance of Shanann Watts and the children in August. But within days, the patriarch was arrested and then pleaded guilty in exchange for prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. At the time, Watts didn’t provide a full account of what occurred or his motives.</p>, <p>

However, he later admitted that was a lie and he was solely responsible for the murders.</p>, <p>According to Watts, he strangled Shanann in their bed on Aug. 14 after he told her their marriage was over and she allegedly said he would never see their children again. He said his wife suspected he was having an affair, which was true. However, Watts claimed he didn’t tell her about the ongoing relationship with a co-worker before killing her.</p>, <p>

Still, the relationship may have “contributed” to his actions.</p>, <p>Wrenn said the first responders weren’t the only ones shaken by Watts’ actions.</p>, <p>“[Also] those who had to attend the autopsies the next day,” said Wrenn. “Those of us who had to sit and be frustrated by the fact that Chris Watts refused to tell us the truth in the initial interview. We knew he was lying, we knew he was involved. We wanted to find those kids and find Shanann. We knew he held the answers to those questions. His denials and the arrogance contained within those denials — I don’t know if I’ve ever been more frustrated in my life watching something take place.”</p>, <p>Watts confessed that after he strangled Shanann, Bella came into the couples’ bedroom clutching a blanket, asking what was wrong with her mother. Watts responded the matriarch wasn’t feeling well. Bella then watched as Watts wrapped the body in a bed sheet and started crying when he pulled it down the stairs of their home. Watts said he put the corpse on the floor of his truck’s back set. Celeste then woke up from the commotion.</p>, <p>

Each child had their own blanket and Celeste also brought along a stuffed animal.</p>, <p>Watts drove to about 40 miles east of the family’s home in Frederick to an oil worksite where he worked as an operator for an oil and gas producer. Watts told police he pulled Shannon’s body from the truck while the girls asked, “What are you doing to mommy?”</p>, <p>Watts then said he went back to the truck and used Celeste’s blanket to smother her as Bella watched from a seat beside her sister. Then, he put Celeste’s body inside an oil tank. He then returned to the truck and smothered Bella using the same blanket. He told police Bella’s last words were “Daddy, no!” as she struggled under the blanket. He then put her body inside another oil tank and buried Shanann's body nearby.</p>, <p>Watts alleged he did not plan to murder his family.</p>, <p>
      According to court documents released, Shanann Watts' body was found in a shallow grave near this oil tank Aug. 21, 2018, near Roggen, Colorado. Both of her daughter's bodies, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, were submerged for days in the same oil tanks in rural eastern Colorado, prosecutors said.

      <!-- --></p>, <p>“I do agree that this crime can only be committed by a sociopath,” said Wrenn. “There’s no other possible explanation.”</p>, <p>Wrenn insisted that despite Watts’ tell-all to investigators, we may never truly know why he was willing to slaughter his entire family.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ted-bundy-ex-girlfriend-extremely-wicked-elizabeth-kloepfer"" target=""_blank""><strong>TED BUNDY'S EX-GIRLFRIEND INSPIRES HAUNTING FILM</strong></a></p>, <p>“When he gave that post-conviction prison interview to the FBI, I think we do get some glimpses into the why,” he explained. “But when you engage in an act that his so horrific and is so far removed from anything the average person ever contemplates doing to their own children, the why is going to be so elusive. It’s nonsensical. It’s so contrary to everything we know about human nature. And for that reason, the why is never going to be satisfying.”</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>“I’m speculating, but based on his own words [he spoke out] because there was a sense of… the cleansing of the conscious,” he continued. “He was trying to come to grips with his future and his faith… Sometimes that happens in a case… there is a desire to let the truth come out. I don’t know if everything he said in that interview was the truth. I don’t know if we’ll ever know [why].

He then alleged to keeping photos of his slain family in his cell and talks to them “every morning and every night.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/survivors-of-larry-nassars-sexual-abuse-speak-out-doc-on-gymnastics-scandal-hbo-doc"" target=""_blank""><strong>SURVIVORS OF LARRY NASSAR'S SEXUAL ABUSE SPEAK OUT IN FILM</strong></a></p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Colorado Bureau of Investigation)</span></p>, <p>“The crime affected a lot of people,” said Wrenn. ""Locally and nationally. Our initial instinct is to want to understand the why. I don’t think a documentary is capable of providing that answer, but maybe it will shed some light on the bigger picture… the factual backdrop in which such a horrific act can be committed.""</p>, <p>“When you looked into his day-to-day activities, the guy would get up, go to work, go home, play with his kids, talk on the phone with his buddies about fantasy football, send text messages throughout the day to his wife about their weekend plans — we can all relate to that lifestyle,” he added. “That’s different from what we normally see in criminal investigations. It’s hard to relate to the people we are investigating because their lives often look so different from ours. Chris Watts’ life didn’t look that much different from the people who were investigating it.”</p>, <p><em>""Family Man, Family Murderer: An ID Murder Mystery"" airs Sunday, June 2 at 10 p.m. on ID.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">At the height of the Cold War in 1984, a quintessential blonde southern California club girl left to spend a week in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). It was a week that would not only transform her life, but shape the Russian rock scene and bring its style and sounds to the United States.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">“After one rock festival, I went to the Leningrad Rock Club. Two guys in suits grabbed me after the concert and took me to the basement to question me,” the now-retired 58-year-old rocker Joanna Stingray, born Joanna Fields, told Fox News. “I continuously told them that I don’t speak Russian and I didn’t understand what they were asking. They finally asked in English who I was and how I got into the club.”</p>, <p>
      Underground St. Petersburg music scene
      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>Despite the rocky start – no pun intended – with KGB spy operatives, Stingray fell hard for the covert punk scene emerging through the cracks of the Cold War in Leningrad, President Vladimir Putin’s native city, now known as St. Petersburg. Stingray went on to build tight friendships with others leading the music genre, sneaking over U.S.-made instruments and coveted California clothing items with every subsequent visit.</p>, <p>“Sometimes there are fragments of time in history that become iconic, like the ’60s in San Francisco. But this magic was happening in Leningrad in the mid-1980s, and there was nothing like it since,” she reminisced. “It was like I was in Wonderland. It was full of surprise and creativity.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/jailed-iranian-musician-rebuffs-regimes-music-ban-by-releasing-album-about-war-and-oppression"" target=""_blank"">JAILED IRANIAN MUSICIAN REBUFFS REGIME'S BAN BY RELEASING ALBUM ABOUT WAR AND OPPRESSION</a></p>, <p>She was determined to evade authorities and bring surprise to the Western world. At the height of global tensions induced by the Cold War, Stingray smuggled out – in the heels of her boots – unofficial recordings of four of the top Soviet rock bands, which she went on to release with the album title “Red Wave.” It became the first of the Soviet Rock albums to infiltrate the Western market in June, 1986 and was a hit that <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-22-ca-20508-story.html"" target=""_blank"">sent ripples</a> through the larger rock arena.</p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>Today, she is often credited as a pioneer for bringing Russian rock to the Western world and cementing a common love of music amid the tension-wracked war period.</p>, <p>But because it was an American woman who had illicitly done the legwork of bringing the genre to the outside world, and not the Soviet leadership itself, featured “Red Wave” musicians were apparently made to sign official documents that maneuvered the blame solely on Stingray.</p>, <p>Soon thereafter, in early 1987, she was suddenly slapped with a six-month ban from the USSR, which meant missing her planned wedding to fellow music man Yuri Kasparyan, the guitarist from the rock group Kino.</p>, <p>“I became an Enemy of the State and was not allowed into Russia and missed my wedding,” Stingray recalled. “They never told me why.”</p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>And just as she had outworn her welcome in the USSR, Stingray said her jaunts in and out didn’t sit well with U.S. officials, either.</p>, <p>“I was questioned by the FBI twice in the years before 1987. I kept telling them I was only doing music, but they didn’t believe anyone would go to Russia every three months unless they were a spy,” she contended.</p>, <p>Undeterred, Stingray continued her underground Russian rock life, eventually marrying – and divorcing Kasparyan – before returning to a quiet California life in 1996, where she went on to have a family, dabble in real estate and helm the Beverly Hills High School Alumni association.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/nuclear-weapons-risk-escalating-debate-over-vintage-u-s-arsenal"" target=""_blank"">AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS RISK ESCALATES, DEBATE GROWS ABOUT 'VINTAGE' US ARSENAL</a></strong></p>, <p>

Trips range anywhere from about $30,000 for locally-based operators to well over $100,000 for tours with amenities such as private guides and personal photographers, according to various estimates. In most cases, foreign climbers also have to cover the costs of climbing equipment, personal injury and helicopter insurance, as well as a $11,000 permit fee to goes the Nepalese government. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">At least 11 people have died while attempting to scale the world’s tallest summit, marking the mountain’s deadliest climbing season since 2015. While experts attribute the trend to several factors, including weather conditions, historically low prices from operators with inexperienced or unqualified guides are luring climbers into a dangerous situation, according to Alan Arnette, a Colorado-based summit coach and blogger who scaled Everest in 2011.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“With operators now offering climbs at $30,000 compared to the ‘old-school’ price of $45,000 to $65,000, people who simply can’t afford to gain the much-needed mountaineering and altitude experience on lesser peaks, believing it’s not needed, jump on the low-cost Everest train,” Arnette said in an email to FOX Business and other news outlets.</p>, <p class=""foxbusiness_mid_article_caption tl-caption"" style=""color:#222;text-align:left !important;display: -webkit-box;-webkit-line-clamp: 3;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;overflow: hidden;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;"">

</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">This year’s deaths, most of which have been linked to altitude sickness, occurred as Nepal’s government issued a record 381 permits to climbers. Veterans have argued that inexperienced climbers are causing traffic jams on the mountain’s narrow trails, putting themselves and others at risk. </p>, <p class=""advert-txt"">Advertisement</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Nepal, which earns roughly $300 million each year from climbing expeditions, places few limits on which applicants can receive permits. Climbers simply need to cover the $11,000 fee and provide proof from a doctor that they are medically fit. According to Arnette, cheaper operators often hire guides who lack the experience needed to respond during an emergency.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“The solution lies in governments having strict qualification on who can guide and climb and not simply accepting their money without question. You have to qualify for the Boston Marathon, but not to climb the world’s highest peak,” Arnette said.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Aside from insurance coverage, high-end operators often require clients to have demonstrated climbing experience. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">For example, <a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.mountainguides.com/pdf/Everest.pdf"" target=""_blank"">International Mountain Guides<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a> warns applicants that they must be “in excellent physical condition, with good technical skills and previous altitude experience” to attempt a climb. <a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://asian-trekking.com/mountaineering-expedition-nepal/eco-everest-expedition"" target=""_blank"">Asian Trekking<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a>, a local operator, requires at least six months of preparation to ensure climbers are fit enough to contend with low oxygen levels.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">""The combination of untrained sherpas and inexperienced climbers is a lethal cocktail but luckily there are better-equipped companies to rally around in case of accidents,"" Asian Trekking managing director Dawa Steven Sherpa told AFP in 2016.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">As deaths mount, Nepalese officials signaled this week that they could alter laws to place more restrictions on which climbers and operators can attempt the trek.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP</strong><span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“It’s time to review all the old laws,” Nepalese parliament member Yagya Raj Sunuwar said, according to the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/world/asia/mount-everest.html"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">New York Times</a>. </p>, <p>Click the button below to comment on this article.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Unfunded pension liabilities per capita in Connecticut are more than $32,800.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Historically low prices from operators with inexperienced or unqualified guides are luring climbers into a dangerous situation.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">A car may be one of the biggest purchases you’ll make this year.

Recall that it was Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Trump’s election would trigger “a global recession.” One continues to wait in vain for an “I was wrong” statement from him.</p>, <p>The Economist, a center-left British magazine that includes coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that “working people” are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-obama-biden-economy-astounding-numbers""><strong>TRUMP 'OWNS' ECONOMY OF 'ASTOUNDING NUMBERS,' NOT OBAMA OR BIDEN, GOP EX-LAWMAKER SAYS</strong></a></p>, <p>The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, “is at odds with reality.” The Economist refers to a worldwide “jobs boom” and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that “Capitalism is improving workers’ lot faster than it has in years ... the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.</p>, <p>Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says that ""Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world.""</p>, <p>A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.</p>, <p>Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: ""reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work.""</p>, <p>This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the “quality” of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, “Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity.”</p>, <p>“Reality begs to differ,” says The Economist. “Official projections” predict that by 2026, “America will have more at-home careers than secretaries.” Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers — and especially younger people — cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements.</p>, <p>Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets “lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts. ... American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink the disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labor market is doing it for them.”</p>, <p>This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.</p>, <p>While acknowledging “The jobs boom will not last forever” and that a recession will eventually “kill it off,” the editorial concludes that the economic boom “deserves a little appreciation.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president.

The president has also eclipsed his predecessor in terms of working on issues Americans believe to be important.</p>, <p>According to the article: “Gallup found that  47% agree with Trump on the issues, edging President Barack Obama at the two year mark of his presidency. In April 2007, 45% agreed with Obama on issues, said Gallup. And Trump was graded more in line with the political ideology of Americans than Obama and former President George W. Bush. Asked about Trump’s ideology, 38% said it was ‘about right.’ Some 35% said the same thing about Obama, and 36% for Bush.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-low-unemployment-strong-job-creation-confirm-strength-of-trump-economy""><strong>NEWT GINGRICH: LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, STRONG JOB CREATION CONFIRM STRENGTH OF TRUMP ECONOMY</strong></a></p>, <p>These are remarkable numbers. They violate the Washington elites’ view of Trump as an unacceptable outsider. If almost half the country agrees with Trump on issues – and more Americans think he is more in line with their ideology than either President Obama or President George W.

With another year of improvement, this may cease to be an issue.</p>, <p>Faced with the strengths of the economy and of President Trump on the issues, the Democrats have two likely paths in 2020.</p>, <p>If they nominate someone like former Vice President Joe Biden, who tries to stay closer to the middle than the left-wing of his party, they run the risk of an election like the one in which former Vice President Walter Mondale was crushed in 1984. </p>, <p>A mild personality that does not stir up passion is fine – until there is a storm. Then, support melts away. Mondale discovered this when he promised to raise taxes. Biden will almost certainly have to endorse some radical positions to hold his party together if he becomes the nominee. Those will then define him, since his mildness will have failed to imprint a strong definition.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>The more likely future is that Democrats will nominate a non-Biden candidate, who is dedicated to stirring up the left by adopting radical positions. In that case, he or she will resemble George McGovern, who was crushed when the country perceived he was too left-wing to be president.</p>, <p>Republicans trying to recapture the House of Representatives and working to increase the Senate GOP majority should study Bedard’s and Rattner’s analyses and start planning for an election in which they have a strong tailwind for the GOP ticket.

Insight from Gene Marks, president of the Marks group.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Most Americans – and many members of Congress – have no idea just how badly the world cheats us with high tariffs and nonreciprocal trade. That's why I recommend everybody read the just-released eye-opening report from the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"" target=""_blank"">White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy</a>.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Stunningly, this report finds that across more than 100 countries stretching from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to China, India, and Vietnam, American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers face systematically higher tariffs on their exports than foreign competitors face when exporting to America. Astonishingly, these nonreciprocal tariffs are perfectly legal under the unfair rules of the broken-down World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>, <p>Take <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/auto"" target=""_blank"">autos</a> for example. The U.S. levies a tariff of only 2.5 percent on foreign imports but the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe"" target=""_blank"">European Union</a> (EU) erects a tariff barrier four times higher – all with the WTO’s blessing! No wonder we’re inundated with Audis and Beemers and VWs. Even when German automakers build assembly plants here in the U.S., they still manufacture the high value-added, high-wage parts like engines and transmission on German soil.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-china-trade-deal-ambassador-cui-tiankai"" target=""_blank"">CHINA 'COMMITTED' TO FORGING NEW TRADE DEAL WITH TRUMP, COUNTRY'S AMBASSADOR TELLS FOX NEWS</a></strong></p>, <p>It’s not just in manufactured goods where America is getting robbed by high nonreciprocal tariffs. When an Arkansas or Louisiana rice farmer tries to export to Malaysia, it’s a 40 percent tariff. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin dairy farmers face a 67 percent European tariff. And South Carolina green tea exported to Thailand faces a 90 percent tariff.</p>, <p>These high nonreciprocal tariffs mean more factories and jobs offshore and less investment and growth in the U.S. than we otherwise could achieve. That’s why in his 2019 <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/state-of-the-union"" target=""_blank"">State of the Union address</a>, President Trump urged Congress to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act (USRTA).</p>, <p>Introduced by Rep. Sean Duffy. R-Wis., last January, the USRTA would give the president the authority to raise tariffs to reciprocal or “mirror” levels if foreign countries refuse to lower their tariffs to U.S. levels. Ask any American on Main Street if he or she thinks this is a good idea, and most are likely to answer ""yes.""</p>, <p>A nationwide Harvard-Harris poll found that 81 percent of respondents support the USRTA, with little partisan difference. If members of Congress voted the views of Main Street rather than their Wall Street donors, the USRTA would pass by a similar or greater margin.</p>, <p>Of course, I’m not going to hold my breath on that possibility. Unlike President Trump, Congress has been out of touch with the American people on the trade issue for decades. How else do you explain the fact that Congress as an institution gave us three of the worst trade deals in American history – the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), China's entry into the WTO in 2001, and the 2012 South Korean free-trade agreement?</p>, <p>How would Congress passing the USRTA benefit America? The new White House report estimates that over $50 billion would be shaved off the trade deficit. With about 6,000 new jobs created per billion dollars of trade deficit reductions, this would lead to more than 300,000 new jobs created.</p>, <p>A lower trade deficit would also mean faster growth from fewer imports, more domestic production, and more exports. In the first quarter of 2019, the real gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.2 percent. One point of that growth was due to a more favorable trade balance – primarily because of the China tariffs.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>The new White House report also finds that the auto and agricultural sectors would benefit the most from passage of the USRTA. Both sectors would see a jump in exports by almost 10 percent.</p>, <p>These findings by the White House underscore why we need to let Trump be Trump on trade policy so he can level the international playing field and fix the broken World Trade Organization policies. The USRTA would provide him with an important new tool, and both sides of the congressional aisle should stop playing petty politics and put the American worker first by passing this legislation immediately.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/corey-lewandowski"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COREY LEWANDOWSKI</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

His morning Twitter rants often include barbs aimed at China. And he has a bipartisan batch of legislators cheering him on.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has urged Trump to ""hang tough on China,"" as ""strength is the only way to win.""</p>, <p>And <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham"">Sen. Lindsey Graham</a>, R-S.C., has told the president, ""We're behind you!""</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-china-trade-deal-ambassador-cui-tiankai""><strong>CHINA 'COMMITTED' TO FORGING NEW TRADE DEAL WITH TRUMP, COUNTRY'S AMBASSADOR TELLS FOX NEWS</strong></a></p>, <p>Toughness has its merits, but it also has its limits. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were certainly tough when they emerged from their hideout and began shooting at the Bolivian soldiers who had surrounded them. But sometimes it is better to look for smart <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/global-economy/trade"">strategies</a> rather than tough ones.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, Trump's approach to the China trade issue is tough but unlikely to be effective. It relies exclusively on unilateral tariffs, and as a result, any deal that is reached will not be the best one possible. Instead of pushing him to come out with guns blazing, members of Congress should argue for a strategy that would work much better: Cooperating with allies to put more greater pressure on China.</p>, <p>There is widespread agreement around the world that China engages in protectionist and other problematic trade practices: failure to protect intellectual property adequately; high tariffs; restrictions on foreign investment; forcing foreign investors to transfer technology to their joint venture partners; industrial subsidies; state-owned enterprises that compete unfairly; and opaque regulatory practices that can be used to discriminate against foreign companies.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns our allies into foes. </p>, <p>The only debate is about what to do about this. The Trump administration has chosen to go it alone, by imposing tariffs on China in a way that violates the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In the view of the Trump administration, these tariffs have ""forced China to the negotiating table,"" but that is a misconception, as the Obama administration was already in the midst of its own negotiations on investment with China (which the Trump administration seems to have abandoned).</p>, <p>Regardless, so far the only outcome from Trump's tariffs has been economic pain on both sides, as China has retaliated with tariffs of its own: consumers in both countries pay higher prices, and many producers in both countries suffer as their exports are suddenly at a disadvantage.</p>, <p>The administration has convinced many people in Washington that tariffs were the last resort, because nothing else has worked with China. But this talking point from the administration is wrong. In fact, there are better options that have not been tried yet.</p>, <p>The first important change in strategy is that confronting China would work much better if undertaken through a coordinated effort. The Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Japanese, Brazilians and many others all have concerns about Chinese trade practices. The administration should reach out to those allies and work together.</p>, <p>A key part of this coordinated effort will be to remove the tariffs and quotas imposed on these allies under the Section 232 statute, ostensibly for ""national security"" purposes, but generally recognized as being simple protectionism. These countries are less inclined to work with us on problems with China when we are attacking them on trade as well. The Trump administration has just removed the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, but tariffs on other countries remain in place.</p>, <p>After organizing this group effort, the United States and its allies should take a two-pronged approach: file complaints against China at the WTO under the various provisions that apply here (China is under greater obligations than most countries, as per the terms of its accession), and negotiate new rules in a multilateral agreement with China.</p>, <p>An important part of the negotiation is that the United States and its allies have to be willing to give something. A one-sided deal is difficult for any country to accept, and this is certainly the case for China, given its history with unequal trade treaties with Western countries. For example, in exchange for China lowering its tariffs, the United States and its allies could agree to abandon the special, more onerous, calculation method used for China and a few other countries when setting anti-dumping duties.</p>, <p>Beyond the negotiations with China, the United States should also be negotiating trade liberalization directly with these same trading partners. The preferential trading arrangements that result would put China at a disadvantage and put pressure on it to liberalize. Unilateral tariffs have led to Chinese tariffs in response, but tariff liberalization could put pressure on China to pursue its own liberalization so as not to be at a disadvantage.</p>, <p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that the Obama administration worked on were examples of this. So far, however, the Trump administration has mostly spent time tweaking existing trade agreements. Putting the emphasis on new liberalization of this kind would have its own benefits, but would also be useful for encouraging a deal with China.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""> <strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>If none of that works, then tough tactics — a unified front to impose new tariffs on China or a discussion of whether China belongs in the WTO — are appropriate. But the Trump administration's approach has ignored or undermined these smarter options.  The first step is to abandon the current, flawed approach, which has led only to tariffs in both directions.</p>, <p>It is possible to push China in the continued direction of reform. Think about the progress it has made since 1978. But reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns our allies into foes.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

As direct and unambiguous as those words are -- the Constitution as amended is the supreme law of the land -- Congress and the courts have not always been faithful to them.</p>, <p>Thus, at the height of the anti-immigrant hysteria whipped up by President Woodrow Wilson and his supporters, Congress enacted the Espionage Act of 1917, which punished speech deemed harmful to America's war efforts. Wilson was determined to win the First World War at the price of the suppression of ideas that he hated or feared.</p>, <p>The Espionage Act was used aggressively and successfully (from Wilson's vantage point) during the war and in the immediate years following.</p>, <p>Then, a series of Supreme Court decisions instructed that the Act is probably unconstitutional as its sole purpose and effect is to suppress speech. These opinions harkened back to Madison, who believed that the only moral and constitutional remedy for hateful or harmful or even seditious speech was not suppression and punishment but rather more speech.</p>, <p>That attitude prevailed generally in the legal and judicial communities and at the Department of Justice for a few generations -- even during World War II -- until now.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Now, the Trump DOJ has indicted a non-American whose alleged crimes took place in Europe for numerous violations of the Espionage Act, and it has done so in direct defiance of a Supreme Court decision that ruled against this during the Nixon years.</p>, <p>The non-American is <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/julian-assange"" target=""_blank"">Julian Assange</a>, a radical and unorthodox publisher of truthful information that often exposes the hypocrisy of government. His entity for exposure is WikiLeaks -- the website known for receiving stolen data and for posting true and accurate copies of them.</p>, <p>It was Assange and WikiLeaks that published the infamous Democratic National Committee emails in October 2016, which contained the ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton once offered by Russian agents to Trump campaign officials, and for which then-candidate Trump lavished public praise on WikiLeaks.</p>, <p>Yet, back in 2010, Assange arranged to receive and publish stolen copies of top-secret military materials that revealed American military personnel in Afghanistan at their worst. It showed them knowingly killing innocent civilians -- and doing so gleefully.</p>, <p>The data that Assange revealed had been stolen for him by an Army private then named <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chelsea-manning-will-go-back-to-jail-after-refusing-to-testify-to-grand-jury-probing-wikileaks"" target=""_blank"">Bradley Manning</a>. Manning was tried and convicted of the theft and was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In January 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence to time served.</p>, <p>If this sounds a bit like history repeating itself from the Nixon years, it is. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg, a civilian employee of the Nixon Department of Defense, revealed that he had stolen thousands of pages of top-secret materials showing that former President Lyndon B. Johnson and some of his generals had serially lied to the American public and to Congress about the Vietnam War.</p>, <p>When he delivered the stolen materials to The New York Times and to The Washington Post for publication, and the Nixon DOJ got wind of the delivery, it persuaded two federal judges to enjoin the publication of the documents.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">In a landmark decision, known as the Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court ruled that a publisher may reveal whatever materials come into the publisher's possession, no matter how they got there, so long as the materials are themselves material to the public interest.</p>, <p>Stated differently, the thief -- Ellsberg then, Manning today -- can be tried for theft, but the publisher is absolutely protected by the ""no law"" language of the First Amendment.</p>, <p>Ellsberg was indicted and prosecuted, but the charges were dismissed by a federal judge whose conscience was shocked when he learned that FBI agents broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist to get ""dirt"" on him.</p>, <p>Assange is also protected by the values underlining that ""no law"" language. The whole purpose of the First Amendment, numerous courts have written, is to promote and provoke open, wide, robust political debate about the policies of the government.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>That simply cannot be done when the government operates in secret.

The sprawling report is 448 pages long, however. In his nine-minute address, Mueller quite consciously highlighted the portions of the report that fuel the Democrats’ calls for impeachment.</p>, <p>Mueller was adamant that he did not make a finding on whether President Trump should be charged with obstruction of justice because the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued guidance forbidding the indictment of a sitting president.

He then emphasized that he did not say so. That strongly implies that he believes the evidence is sufficient (notwithstanding that the attorney general has found otherwise). Mueller added that, in deciding not to allege obstruction even though the evidence was arguably sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he relied on the OLC guidance. Finally, he deduced from this, and from his understanding of the Constitution, that in our system it is for Congress, not federal prosecutors, to deal with presidential misconduct.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-press-conference-impeachment-politics-democrats/""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</strong></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/andrew-mccarthy""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Few D.C. politicians understand that because they are used to patronizing Americans with lip service and a check.</p>, <p>Now let me be clear, I understand why President Trump issued this aid, the second round since July of last year when the government allocated $12 billion to offset the plight.</p>, <p>Do I think a multi-billion dollar farm subsidy or bailout will fix the problem? No.</p>, <p>But President Trump had to do something to shut up the beltway Democrats and media hacks who launched an anti-Trump smear campaign blaming him for farmer’s woes.</p>, <p>Yes, the trade negotiations with China have certainly been a factor BUT consider this: corn, soybean and wheat prices began their decline in mid-2012, long before Trump took office and imposed tariffs.</p>, <p>Why? Well, there's no single answer for that but overproduction had a lot to do with it.</p>, <p>Our farmers have been planting and preparing enough crops to feed the world and yes, trade uncertainty threw a wrench in the process.</p>, <p>But here’s something else to consider -- although our imports on grain, corn, and soybeans are indeed very low, why are we importing AT ALL?</p>, <p>If we produce enough of those crops to feed the world AND have an overproduction surplus, why import at all, even a tiny amount?</p>, <p>Guess what else we import a lot of in recent years -- beef products.</p>, <p>Follow the money. American cattle ranches rely on American farmers for feed. The American cattleman has been royally screwed over by foreign beef imports with many ranchers run completely out of business.</p>, <p>In fact, according to data compiled by American Cattlemen advocacy group RCALF, we have eliminated over 175,000 cattle farms and ranches since 1994, the year we entered NAFTA.</p>, <p>Consequently, we have 8.5 million fewer cattle today than we had in 1994. Those missing cows would be eating a lot of corn.</p>, <p>Also, if we were raising and feeding the half-a-million cattle that we import each year for immediate slaughter, there would be additional demand for crops that could have fed those animals, right here in the U.S.</p>, <p>Fewer American cattle ranchers leads to less demand for American feed and hence, we now have an over-abundance of corn, grain, and wheat.</p>, <p>A surplus drives down prices and hits our American farmers in the pocketbook. It is all linked.</p>, <p>The USDA is planning a $100 million trade promotion program for livestock producers, yet, if you look at this latest $16-billion-dollar farm bailout, there are allowances for crops, dairy and hogs but NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH for American cattle ranchers.</p>, <p>President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout either but they would like that level playing field and you can make that happen, easily.</p>, <p>Under regulations Trump inherited from the Obama administration, the beef you find in a local grocery store can be labeled ‘Product of USA’ as long as it was packaged here.

Days later, Barr released a four-page summary of the findings, noting Mueller’s team found no evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">An ancient rocky structure found at the heart of the Ross ice shelf helps determine where Antarctica's ice melts and where it stays firm and frozen.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The structure is an old tectonic boundary, probably formed during the birth of the Antarctic continent or shortly thereafter. According to new research published May 27 in the journal Nature Geoscience, this boundary protects the ice shelf's grounding line, the point at which it is thick enough to extend all the way to the sea floor. The geology created by the boundary keeps warm, melt-promoting ocean water away from that part of the shelf. But the ocean circulation driven by that same geology drives intense summer melt along the shelf's easterly edge.</p>, <p>""We could see that the geological boundary was making the seafloor on the East Antarctic side much deeper than the West, and that affects the way the ocean water circulates under the ice shelf,"" study leader Kirsty Tinto, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, <a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/eiac-sus052419.php"" target=""_blank"">said in a statement</a>. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/64039-photos-antarctica.html"" target=""_blank"">Antarctica: The Ice-Covered Bottom of the World (Photos)</a>]</p>, <p>The Ross ice shelf is an expanse of ice 185,000 square miles (480,000) square kilometers) in area and hundreds of feet thick. Ice flows onto the shelf from the land-based East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. Currently, the ice shelf is stable , Tinto and her colleagues wrote in Nature Geoscience, but geological and marine records show that is has collapsed in the distant past.</p>, <p>To understand the dynamics of the ice sheet, Tinto and her colleagues used data from an airplane-based tool called IcePod, which holds instruments that collect information on ice-shelf thickness and structure as well as instruments that detect magnetic and gravitational anomalies from the rock underlying the ice shelf. Magnetic minerals, for instance, found in magma and other rocky material under Antarctica, can change the magnetic-field readings in those spots, while undersea topography can affect gravitational readings. With this data, the researchers reconstructed a map of the ice shelf and the rock underneath. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/60801-photos-antarctica-dive.html"" target=""_blank"">Photos: Diving Beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf</a>]</p>, <p>They found a stark transition zone bisecting the ice sheet. If Antarctica were a wheel, the boundary would look a bit like a spoke, emanating from a spot a bit off-center. This transition zone is actually the line of demarcation between the geology of West Antarctica and East Antarctica. To the west, the rocks are a combination of sedimentary and magmatic, having formed from tectonic interactions, at the confluence of an oceanic and tectonic plate. East Antarctica is ancient continental material known as craton.</p>, <p>The newly discovered tectonic boundary bisecting the Ross ice shelf matters because it helps shape the seafloor beneath the ice. To the east, the seafloor is deeper, at 2,198 feet (670 meters), on average. To the west, the average depth is 1,837 feet (560 m), on average.</p>, <p>The researchers used a computer model to show how seawater circulates, given this new geologic knowledge. The good news is that the seafloor geometry keeps most warm ocean water away from the Ross ice shelf. Instead, an area of open sea called the Ross Shelf Polynya vents the warm, deep-ocean water, cooling it before it can flow beneath the ice shelf. But there is a lot of ice melt along the leading edge of the ice shelf (where it meets the sea), especially in the summer. The highest summer melt is near Ross Island, on the East Antarctic side.</p>, <p>So what does it all mean for a warming Antarctic? In the near future, the ice shelf's grounding line (the point at which it contacts the seafloor) should remain stable, at least in the face of moderate climate change, the researchers wrote. But variations in local climate will have a big impact on how fast the front edge of the ice shelf melts. These variations could include reductions in sea ice declines or cloud cover decreases, Laurie Padman, a senior scientist at Earth and Space Research in Oregon and study co-author, said in the statement.</p>, <p>""We found out that it's these local processes we need to understand to make sound predictions,"" Tinto said.</p>, <p><em>Originally published on </em><em> <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/65588-ancient-rocky-structure-beneath-antarctica.html"" target=""_blank"">Live Science</a></em>.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

He went on to put out 16 more records.</p>, <p>His career got a boost in the early 1970s when Bob Dylan met him at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Ontario, Canada, and praised his performance.

He also sang theme songs for such works as ""Mr. Belvedere"" and ""Harry &amp; The Hendersons.""</p>, <p>In addition, he also voiced Leon the Snowman character in Will Ferrell’s beloved 2003 movie ""Elf,"" and did a duet with the movie's female lead, Zooey Deschanel, for “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.”</p>, <p>Redbone retired from performing in 2015 because his health had ""been a matter of concern for some time,"" a spokesman for the singer said at the time, and it was ""too challenging for him to continue the full range of professional activities.""</p>, <p>A 16-minute documentary about his life, ""Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,"" was released last year.</p>, <p>No further details about his death were available at the time of publication.</p>, <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this story.</i></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Welcome to Alice in D.C. land. <br/><br/>
Robert Mueller, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"" target=""_blank"">the special prosecutor</a>, told us Wednesday that he could not say if Donald Trump committed a crime. When I was in law school, I took a criminal procedure class. If I had said, the prosecutor could not prove that no crime was committed, I would have received an “F.""</p>, <p class=""speakable""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-says-democracy-feels-far-from-secure-blames-trump-administration"" target=""_blank"">HILLARY CLINTON SAYS DEMOCRACY 'FEELS FAR FROM SECURE' AT HUNTER COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT</a></strong></p>, <p><br/><br/>
In Washington, however, that qualifies you to be a special prosecutor. In D.C. Land, you get to turn the world upside down and claim moral righteousness.<br/><br/>
All of which bring us Hillary’s Hunter College commencement address. Still angry about her 2016 loss -- that was caused by so many people other than herself -- and with Trump in mind, Hillary condemned the administration for rejecting requests for testimony and documents from Democrats in Congress. <br/><br/>
She then asked, “What do we do when people in positions of authority are not held accountable?”<br/><br/>
Well, during the Obama administration, “we” did the following:<br/><br/>
1. “We” allowed Hillary to have a server that was hacked in her home that exposed classified information. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
2.  “We” allowed Hillary to bleach-bit her computer server, thereby destroying evidence under subpoena and obstructing justice. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
3.  “We” allowed Hillary not to turn over 17,448 messages including thousands of work messages – an obstruction of justice. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
4.  “We” allowed the Clinton Foundation to take in millions – some of which wound up in the accounts of Hillary and Bill while she was Secretary of State. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
5. “We” allowed her to pay a law firm, to pay for the false dossier used to attack Trump – a clear campaign law violation (a candidate is required to disclose the true recipient of their expenditures not intermediaries). She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
That list could go on and on but the result remains the same. The person demanding accountability was not held accountable for a series of provable acts.<br/><br/>
Of course, we should never forget how Hillary acted when her husband was under investigation. Hillary led what amounted to as a task force to discredit the accusers of Bill Clinton, which included witness intimidation, a form of obstruction, and at the same time she claims all women have the “right to be believed.”<br/><br/>
Mind you, that wasn’t all that Hillary said in her commencement address. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>
The illustrious alumna of an administration that spied on the press, spied on Americans using false dossiers and corrupt FISA applications, and the administration that harassed conservatives via the IRS, was not done yet.<br/><br/>
Hillary said, “Over the last two years, we’ve seen people wearing Nazi symbols once again . . .”<br/><br/>
The ""last two years"" is, of course, her way of saying that it is all the fault of Trump. Never mind that administration that she served committed untold abuses – when all else fails, including your moral clarity – claim the opposition is heinous, racist or even comprised of Nazis.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Fortunately, Hillary lost because of who <em>she</em> is.  <br/><br/>

Despite the emergence of louse-borne typhus, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california"" target=""_blank"">Los Angeles</a> can’t seem to get its act together.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tammy-bruce-identity-politics-commencement"" target=""_blank"">TAMMY BRUCE: THE LEFT’S OBSESSION WITH IDENTITY POLITICS SINKS TO A SAD, NEW LOW</a></strong></p>, <p>Steve Lopez of the Los Angeles Times reported a week ago on the obscene condition of downtown Los Angeles, “A mountain of rotting, oozing, stinking trash … stretching a good 20 yards along a skid row alley. Rats popped their heads out of the debris like they were in a game of Whac-A-Mole, then scampered for cover as a tractor with a scoop lurched toward them. … The trash problem is not confined to any one street, but this particular location on the 800 block of Ceres Avenue is surrounded by food distribution companies that sell to shoppers, vendors, stores and restaurants. I counted seven within a block, so you have to wonder — given the colonies of football-size rats — about the potential contamination of the food supply chain and the spread of disease.”</p>, <p>What does the city say when confronted about the slow, or nonexistent, pace of cleanup?</p>, <p>A “spokeswoman for the city Department of Public Works said the backlog on service calls for trash pickup around homeless encampments sits at just under 8,400 currently. … ‘If it’s a homeless encampment, it’s a lengthier process because humans are involved and we have to meet certain protocols,’ she said, including a survey of who’s there, an inventory of personal property and notice of a cleanup,” the Times reported.</p>, <p>That’s right. Their concern for the people who are at ground zero for emerging deadly viruses is to follow protocols involving surveys and inventories. So don’t you worry — big government is keeping itself busy, as it behaves as though it’s normal to have more than 2,000 people sleeping on trash heaps, as potential epidemics lurk.</p>, <p>This is the idiotic disaster brought to you by unrestrained liberal leadership as it creates problems, then births a bureaucracy that will never deal with it.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">One glance at the formerly Golden State is a frightening embarrassment. The latest indictment of liberal leadership is the trash heap of Los Angeles.

The state actually has a budget surplus, but as we see, money can’t cure stupid.</p>, <p>Which brings us to Gov. Gavin Newsom and his plan. He’s outraged, just outraged at the “national disgrace” of California’s homelessness.</p>, <p>The Ventura County Star reported, “Gov. Gavin Newsom called growing homelessness in California a national disgrace as he announced Tuesday that he is launching a task force to find solutions amid a housing crisis in the most populous state.”</p>, <p>Like Los Angeles, instead of dealing with the reality of the problem, Newsom announced the creation of a task force, the members of which will travel around the state and make recommendations. There’s only one recommendation, and they won’t like it, that will change the state’s fate: a plea to all California voters to stop electing Democrats.</p>, <p>Yes, there’s nothing finer in a leader than the effort to blame everyone else for the scourge of homelessness your fellow Democrats have created over the years. California’s disaster isn’t a national disgrace, it’s not even California’s disgrace; it’s the disgrace of every liberal politician in the state who has led that state into medieval crisis.</p>, <p>Speaking of medieval crises, Dr. Drew Pinsky, the addiction medicine specialist, told Brian Kilmeade of Fox News that a deadly epidemic could emerge in Los Angeles during the summer months.</p>, <p>""I live in the great state of California, the utopia that is California, which is a nightmare,’ Pinsky said. ‘I want to give you a prediction here. There will be a major infectious disease epidemic this summer in Los Angeles.’ He continued, ‘We have tens and tens of thousands of people living in tents. Horrible conditions. Sanitation. Rats have taken over the city. We’re the only city in the country, Los Angeles, without a rodent control program. We have multiple rodent-borne, flea-borne illnesses, plague, typhus. We’re gonna have louse-borne illness. If measles breaks into that population, we have tuberculosis exploding. Literally, our politicians are like Nero. It’s worse than Nero,’ Pinsky said,” Fox News reported.</p>, <p>But it’s different now. Every Nero has a task force.</p>, <p>It’s so bad in California, even The New York Times deigned to allow an opinion piece decrying the growing instability of the state.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>In “America’s Cities Are Unlivable.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Our nation is at war. I’m not talking about an external battle -- we are in a war for our nation, our national security and its future. The battleground? The classroom.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Our nation’s <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education"" target=""_blank"">education</a> system is failing, and it’s time to treat the problem as seriously as we would any external attack.</p>, <p>According to the Nation’s Report Card, two-thirds of our nation’s eighth-grade students are below proficiency in math. More than three-quarters are below proficiency in civics.</p>, <p>That should frighten every American.</p>, <p>Yet despite the grave state of our nation’s schools, people like <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders"" target=""_blank"">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> are trying to kill a successful and popular public school option and restrict our educational system to only one vision of education, standing in the way of opportunity for more students, in the name of conformity.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-supporters-fearful-dnc-and-mainstream-media-colluding-against-americans"" target=""_blank""><strong>SANDERS SUPPORTERS FEARFUL DNC NOW BACKING BIDEN LIKE IT BACKED CLINTON: REPORT</strong></a></p>, <p>As part of his latest presidential campaign, Sanders has <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bernie-sanders-releases-plan-to-ban-for-profit-charter-schools"" target=""_blank"">proposed a moratorium </a>on federal funding for public charter schools. That makes no sense.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Charter schools are one of the best weapons we have to educate children, particularly poor or minority children.</p>, <p>Studies from the University of Arkansas and many other institutions show that charter schools regularly outperform better than their public counterparts with less funding.</p>, <p>Sanders’s tirades about charter transparency (which of course exists), regulation (which charters have plenty of) and accountability (which is the very essence of charters) are both misinformed and counter-productive.</p>, <p>More importantly, Sanders’s proposal will disempower parents. New education options have seen an explosion of growth in the last two decades, and not because they’ve been foisted on communities and children by federal bureaucrats. It’s because parents in cities around the country have demanded the option to send their child to innovative, high-quality schools.</p>, <p>Just look at the black community, one of the most underserved populations in America. 86 percent of black parents support having more options in public education, including traditional public schools and charters. But many of those parents are hindered by the lack of available charter schools or by long wait lists.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The message has been clear and consistent: parents want more options, not fewer.</p>, <p>Education should not be about prioritizing one learning environment over another. Every asset is important in the battle, and our children can’t afford for us to play favorites. And yet powerful interest groups like teachers unions want us to believe that there’s only one way to educate students -- that a monolithic, top-down, centrally-controlled system is superior for every student. That’s simply not the case.</p>, <p>As Johns Hopkins professor Ashley Berner argues in her pathbreaking study of other countries, pluralism in education works. Countries that sponsor and support a wide array of educational options show not only equality of opportunity, but equality of results.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The U.S. is by nature a pluralistic country, and yet some behave -- including Sanders -- as if we should live in a dictatorship when it comes to education.</p>, <p>But we are not. We’re a pluralistic nation with thousands of different peoples, cultures, and habits.  Our education system should mirror the diversity that is America’s wealth and hallmark. We have fought to keep our nation the land of opportunity, and we must fight to ensure that opportunity exists in every venue, most notably in education.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>To win the war for education excellence, we cannot use only one type of weapon. We must put all of our assets on the battlefield, supporting any education program or organization that communities, parents, and educators can develop.</p>, <p>If the opponents of choice and educational progress had their way, our nation’s students will not have that future. The battles we wage are for them. Who are yours for, Senator?</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Although the former special counsel popped up during a sleepy, holiday-shortened week in Washington, the ramifications extend long and well beyond.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">As the most visible leaders of a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats"" target=""_blank"">Democratic Party</a> hellbent on ousting <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"" target=""_blank"">President Trump</a> by any means necessary – including impeachment –  <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi"" target=""_blank"">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> and former <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden"" target=""_blank"">Vice President Joe Biden</a> felt the immediate aftershocks.</p>, <p>Both Pelosi and Biden have wisely handled the hot potato of impeachment with caution. As denizens of D.C. with a combined nearly 80 years in the Beltway, they have been through many a political fight. They know the perils of blundering headfirst into unwinnable battles. They were around during the 1990s for the failed GOP impeachment effort to end President Clinton. They watched it blow up in Republicans’ faces – and imperiled their congressional majority.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/colin-reed-elizabeth-warren-2020-campaign-win"" target=""_blank"">COLIN REED: ELIZABETH WARREN’S 2020 CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING UP AFTER A ROCKY START – BUT IS SHE IN IT TO WIN IT?</a></strong></p>, <p>It was no surprise that both held their course after Wednesday's news and continued pumping the brakes on the i-word.</p>, <p>If you’re Biden, owner of a commanding lead in both primary and general election polls, you know the easiest path to regaining power is through the ballot box next November. Critics on his left and his Democratic opponents may think otherwise but Biden presumably wouldn’t have entered a race he didn’t think was possible. A nasty and prolonged impeachment battle knocks him off his current trajectory, which one month into his candidacy, has exceeded all expectations.</p>, <p>If you’re Pelosi, whose political acumen is acknowledged by even her harshest critics in their quieter moments, you know you owe your gavel to the 31 purple districts that rejected Republican members of the House last year in favor of middle-of-the-road Democratic alternatives.</p>, <p>There’s no downside to beating the impeachment drum in Queens or Silicon Valley where the only threat to your congressional seat looms over your left shoulder in a primary. It’s a different calculus in the I-4 corridor of Florida or the farms of Virginia or the Orange County suburbs of California that once were the stomping ground of Ronald Reagan. These Democrats ended generations of GOP dominance last November running as a check on Trump – not as a supporter of Pelosi.</p>, <p>It’s been a decade since the summer of 2009 when Pelosi allowed an ill-advised vote on cap-and-trade that forced her vulnerable members to take a tough vote that cost many of them their jobs. Impeachment could have a similar effect, and once again cut Pelosi’s speakership short.</p>, <p>Ironically, the greatest threats to both Biden and Pelosi come not from the Republicans but from their own party. Several top-flight members of the 2020 wannabes used Wednesday as their ticket to board the impeachment train. No longer is  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a lonely voice in the wilderness beating the impeachment drum. She has company from fellow Senators, Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, among others. That list stands poised to grow, especially as next month’s first primary debate approaches, and candidates’ desperate to separate from the pack increases.</p>, <p>Biden used a written statement issued by a spokesperson as his only public comment Wednesday. For a candidate already under fire for a lackadaisical campaign schedule, that position is untenable. It’s 2019 and voters consume their news through video, not writing. Expect Biden to be pressed to go further on the campaign hustings and especially at Miami’s debate.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>While Pelosi’s hold on her caucus has been impressive, it could crumble quickly. The list of her pro-impeachment members stands close to 40. That number could jump any moment, especially if one of the more vocal members of the media-savvy freshman class decides to light a match. Many members of the new Congress made promises to take down Trump. If they decide it’s time to fulfill that pledge, Pelosi’s headaches will grow.</p>, <p>The temperature has been rising in Washington this week, both literally and politically. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden can’t prevent the summer humidity from setting in, but they are keeping a check on the heat around impeachment – at least for now.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/colin-reed"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM COLIN REED</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Instead, he fell back on the convoluted language in his report, hoping to obfuscate an issue that Attorney General William Barr had previously clarified by determining that the special counsel’s investigation did not produce sufficient evidence to justify charging President Trump with obstructing justice.</p>, <p>“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller told reporters, explaining that, as part of the Justice Department, his office was “bound by” the OLC’s opinion.</p>, <p>“Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider,” Mueller said.</p>, <p>That’s a fantasy Mueller just tried to sell on national TV. Here’s the reality.</p>, <p>If President Trump actually committed a crime, there is nothing in the OLC’s opinion that would have prevented the special counsel or the attorney general from saying so.</p>, <p>The most relevant concern the OLC raises is that an indictment “exposes the President to an official pronouncement that there is probable cause to believe he committed a criminal act,” which could impair “his credibility in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The motive is obvious. Mueller, having failed for two years to find Trump-Russia “collusion,” is trying to reframe the Russiagate narrative in an effort to put some wind back in the sails of the impeachment effort.</p>, <p>A special counsel’s private report to the attorney general ran no such risk, especially since Barr was under no legal obligation to make Mueller’s report public. Special counsels don’t issue indictments – grand juries do.</p>, <p>That’s why the last man with responsibilities similar to Mueller’s – Independent Counsel Ken Starr – had no qualms writing definitively about findings of criminal wrongdoing by the subject of his investigation, President Bill Clinton.</p>, <p>“The Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) hereby submits substantial and credible information that President /Clinton obstructed justice … the President lied under oath to the grand jury and obstructed justice,” Starr wrote, along with dozens of other unambiguous determinations that President Clinton had committed crimes.</p>, <p>The idea that the OLC somehow stopped Mueller from doing the same thing is absurd.</p>, <p>If Mueller thought there was probable cause to charge President Trump with obstruction of justice – or any other crime – he could have said so in his report without any repercussions.</p>, <p>Because Mueller’s report was a private, internal Justice Department document intended for the attorney general, Mueller could draw any conclusion he wanted regarding President Trump without violating Justice Department policy against disclosing derogatory uncharged conduct.</p>, <p>If, on the other hand, Mueller believed that the evidence was not sufficient to establish a chargeable case of obstruction of justice, he could have said so just as easily. He did, in fact, do exactly that with dozens of other potential crimes over the course of his report, including the one that served as the basis for his entire investigation.</p>, <p>Most crucially, Mueller’s own report admitted that the Special Counsel’s Office  “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”</p>, <p>Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had the courage and integrity to do what Mueller would not. Reviewing the same underlying material that Mueller developed, and in consultation with other senior Justice Department attorneys, Barr and Rosenstein jointly concluded that the evidence was “not sufficient” to constitute obstruction of justice by President Trump. Period.</p>, <p>More importantly, Barr went out of his way to dispel any notion that his determination had anything to do with the OLC’s opinion.</p>, <p>“Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president,” Barr said.</p>, <p>The entire idea that President Trump’s vindication rested solely on the OLC opinion should have died the day Barr released his preliminary summary of the Mueller report’s conclusions.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, Mueller has created new shades of gray for the Democrats to exploit and chose this politically opportune moment to do so, as the Russiagaters flail on Capitol Hill.</p>, <p>The motive is obvious. Mueller, having failed for two years to find Trump-Russia “collusion,” is trying to reframe the Russiagate narrative in an effort to put some wind back in the sails of the impeachment effort.</p>, <p>Mueller couldn’t even stop himself from dropping a not-so-subtle hint to that effect when he spoke to reporters and the TV audience, characterizing the OLC’s opinion as saying that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”</p>, <p>Undoubtedly, those making a show out of trying to impeach President Trump over the next year will hang on these words and adopt Mueller’s narrative – even though it’s a far cry from the “collusion” hoax that spawned this whole sorry saga.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>If that wasn’t Mueller’s intention all along, it certainly has been ever since he must have realized that his whole investigation was nothing more than a witch hunt.</p>, <p>The case was made and is now closed, but that didn’t stop Mueller from taking one last shot at President Trump that will ultimately change nothing about the conclusions Mueller made in his own report.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/d/joseph-digenova"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOE DIGENOVA</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

The only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>And then from their seats on cable news sets across New York City, America's opinion generating class applauded heartily:</p>, <p><em>Ari Melber, MSNBC host: This was vintage Bob Mueller, no questions, no bull.</em></p>, <p><em>Frank Figliuzzi, MSNBC national security analyst: He speaks in measured, but clear tones and style. </em></p>, <p><em>Glenn Kirschner, former federal prosecutor: That's the man Bob Mueller is. He is precise. He is factual. He is accurate. The man doesn't know the definition of hyperbole. </em></p>, <p><em>Chris Matthews, MSNBC host: I think a lot of us have been very supportive of Mueller and what he's done. He has worked very hard and done a really good job. </em></p>, <p>Man, can they suck up when they want to! A man never stands so tall when he stoops to kiss a butt. That's their motto. It's unbelievable.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">When Robert Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>But you may be slightly confused, listening to all this. Democrats are demanding impeachment, and the press strongly agrees with that. They love Robert Mueller. But what will the crime be, exactly? What would the charges be in an impeachment proceeding? Would it be Russian collusion, the core charge?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Well, as Mueller himself conceded, there's no evidence that ever happened.</p>, <p>""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,"" he said during his public statement. ""This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.""</p>, <p>""Insufficient evidence."" In other words, there was no crime. That's how it works. The same is true for obstruction, by Mueller's own admission. After two years, he and his subordinates were unable to find a criminal act.</p>, <p>""The report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president,"" Mueller said. ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""</p>, <p>""Under longstanding department policy, a present president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,"" Mueller added. ""That is unconstitutional. The Special Counsel's Office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""</p>, <p>Yes, got that. We knew that, in fact.</p>, <p>And just to be clear, prosecutors in civilized countries don't prove people innocent. They don't need to do that. That's the standing presumption that all of us have by virtue of our citizenship. Instead, prosecutors look for evidence of guilt, and if there is no evidence of guilt, a person is declared not guilty. That's how our system works.</p>, <p>So when Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>Yet, Mueller would clearly like to see the president impeached anyway. Democrats are likely to take him up on that.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on May 29, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Jacqui Heinrich reports.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">A draft resolution set to be debated this weekend at the California Democratic Party State Convention, obtained by Fox News, accuses the Israeli government of willfully ""aligning with the virulent Islamophobia"" of white supremacist groups in the U.S. -- and links Israel indirectly to the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-leaves-11-dead-and-6-wounded-suspect-hit-with-multiple-charges"" target=""_blank"">Oct. 2018 massacre</a> of 11 congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The resolution could prompt a dramatic floor debate at the convention if the party's Resolutions Committee decides to table it, Fox News is told, as prominent national Democrats have wrestled with <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-passes-resolution-indirectly-calling-out-omars-anti-semitic-comments-without-mentioning-her-name"" target=""_blank"">high-profile allegations of anti-Semitism</a> in their ranks in recent months. <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-passes-resolution-indirectly-calling-out-omars-anti-semitic-comments-without-mentioning-her-name"" target=""_blank"">Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar</a> and <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rep-lee-zeldin-on-tlaib-holocaust-comments-anti-israel-hate-should-not-be-welcome"" target=""_blank"">Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib</a>, in particular, have faced scrutiny from their own party for comments widely perceived to be anti-Semitic. In March, the House <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-passes-resolution-indirectly-calling-out-omars-anti-semitic-comments-without-mentioning-her-name"" target=""_blank"">passed a bipartisan resolution condemning various forms of bigotry</a> in response.</p>, <p>The document was one of a slew of secretive, unpublished proposals obtained by Fox News that are slated for debate beginning Friday morning. A total of 14 Democrat presidential contenders are set to descend on the San Francisco gathering at the Moscone Convention Center, including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, and Bernie Sanders.</p>, <p>Some of the draft resolutions would mandate that Democrat officials work to ""nullify"" President Trump's pro-Israel policies. One document directs party officials to take a subsidized trip to Israel only ""if they undertake to devote an equal amount of time to visiting Palestinian towns, villages and refugee camps in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories.""</p>, <p>Tentatively titled ""Commending the House for resolving to fight all racism and bigotry and for resisting the false conflation of support for Palestinian rights with antisemitism,"" the resolution blasting Israel's purported role in furthering white supremacy was authored by David Mandel, an elected state Assembly delegate and progressive attorney who says he holds dual U.S.-Israel citizenship and lived in Israel for 10 years.</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>The document calls the October synagogue shooting ""the culmination of an alarming re-emergence of virulent antisemitism that is a core element of historical and currently resurgent white supremacism in the United States and around the world."" The ""Israeli government, along with some of its U.S. backers,"" the resolution continues, ""welcomed support from Christian fundamentalist and ultra-right groups in the United States and abroad, dangerously ignoring their deeply rooted antisemitism while aligning with their virulent Islamophobia.""</p>, <p>Speaking to Fox News, Mandel said it would be ""far-fetched"" to say that the resolution ""directly"" blames Israel for violence against Jews. But, he suggested, Israel officials did bear some indirect responsibility for both anti-Semitic and Islamophobic violence.</p>, <p>""The Israeli government and its supporters here seem to be embracing the right-wing and not caring what they say about anything else -- Islamophobia, dog whistles for anti-Semitism,"" Mandel said. ""That, I think, does indirectly lead to some of the violence.""</p>, <p>Mandel added: ""What we're saying is the Israeli government is aligning itself with right-wing governments around the world, including in this country, and those right-wing groups -- a core tenet of their ideology is antisemitism.""</p>, <p>The resolution, like several others, will quickly go before a Resolutions Committee, which largely has control of which resolutions are adopted and debated.</p>, <p>""Most of the 3,000 or 4,000 delegates at the convention will agree with us,"" Mandel said, ""but that doesn't mean we're going to succeed in passing the resolution.""</p>, <p>Protesters gather for the 59th straight Friday on the border; Trey Yingst reports from the scene.</p>, <p>Mandel noted that many delegates had not yet seen the specific text of his resolutions, although approximately 200 delegates in total have already endorsed several that he will propose.</p>, <p>However, even if the committee seeks to quash a resolution, delegates have the option of quickly gathering 300 signatures to force a debate on the floor.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/minneapolis-police-struggle-to-solve-crime-root-out-somali-gang-problem-and-build-trust-in-tight-lipped-somali-community"" target=""_blank"">ON THE GROUND IN ILHAN OMAR'S DISTRICT: GANGS, DISTRUST IN POLICE FESTER</a></strong></p>, <p>""We may do that,"" Mandel told Fox News, noting that a ""more conservative establishment"" is dominant on the rules committee, even as a more progressive wing is insurgent in the party. In 2017, Mandel hastily negotiated with the Rules Committee to <a href=""https://mondoweiss.net/2017/05/groundbreaking-resolution-california/"" target=""_blank"">secure passage</a> of an unprecedented resolution condemning what it characterized as the U.S. support for Israeli ""occupation of the Palestinian lands,"" and opposing crackdowns on economic boycotts of Israel.</p>, <p>Mandel's new resolution praises House Democrats for passing the broad resolution opposing bigotry. And, in an apparent reference to Omar, the resolution adds that the ""California Democratic Party opposes all efforts to stigmatize and suppress support for Palestinian human rights by falsely conflating it with antisemitism, whether in the unfounded attacks and even death threats against Democratic members of Congress or in the widespread efforts to shut down discussion and intimidate students on campuses around the country.""</p>, <p>Party officials said they would not discuss the private documents. ""We won’t be commenting on resolutions that have not yet been finalized, debated or adopted,"" California Democratic Party spokesman Roger Salazar told Fox News.</p>, <p>The resolution requiring party officials visiting Israel to also spend time in Palestinian territory, also drafted by Mandel, was aimed at countering what Mandel called Israeli-organized ""propaganda"" trips that host foreign politicians.</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>A ""full, balanced understanding of the situation is crucial for officials responsible for shaping U.S. policy in the region or who might have such responsibilities in the future,"" the resolution states. ""The government of Israel and U.S. organizations that support it frequently invite members of Congress, state legislators and other public officials to tour Israel on subsidized trips that are clearly – and often admittedly -- meant to cultivate sympathy for its policies, imparting only a partial view of the situation in Israel/Palestine.""</p>, <p>Another resolution, apparently drafted in part by a San Francisco-based progressive attorney, lamented the ""untenable status quo – rocket firings into Israel from Gaza, regular air and artillery bombardment of Gaza neighborhoods, and sniper shootings of unarmed civilians at the fence, with hundreds of Palestinians killed and thousands wounded since March 2018.""</p>, <p>The document ""urges Congress and the administration to demand that Israel and Egypt end their blockade of the Gaza Strip in favor of immediate international involvement to restore a semblance of normal life for the area’s 2 million Palestinians while ensuring the security of all parties and advancing toward a political settlement in the region.""</p>, <p>""We need to pay more attention to this phenomoneon,"" Mandel said, referring to the rise of white supremacy and its supporters domestically and abroad. ""It's bigger than we thought.""</p>, <p>Other resolutions set to be debated at the convention, which will conclude on Sunday, include some condemning U.S. policy in Venezuela, as well as proposals on a host of domestic issues.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

She also accused her husband of 13 years of threatening to kidnap their children and take them to Greece.</p>, <p>Fotis Dulos has strongly pushed back on those allegations, said he turned in his handgun to the Farmington police and claimed it was his wife who was the unfit parent.

On Tuesday, Fotis Dulos filed legal motion to get full custody of his children. Despite being turned away by his in-law, court papers show Fotis Dulos and his wife shared custody of the kids.

While the job paid poorly, she wasn’t considering <u><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/career"" target=""_blank"">switching careers<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></u>. That all changed one Saturday after a knock on her door.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Continue Reading Below</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“There was this beautiful girl that was my upstairs neighbor standing there,” Schneider says. “She was having a party for the World Series and asked me if I wanted to attend. I didn’t, but we became friends.”</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">That meeting changed Schneider's life forever. Her neighbor worked as a clerk for Merrill Lynch at the Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange. She took Schneider under her wing and introduced her to the world of Wall Street. The teacher became the student. Schneider says she was blown away the first time she visited the floor of the exchange.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“I was like this is where I need to be,” she says. “I knew nothing about finance. It wasn’t like I came from a family that even had investments. I don’t know exactly what it was, but when I saw 3,000 or so people running around, the action, all the boards and prices of all of the different commodities and the excitement – it clicked.”  </p>, <p class=""foxbusiness_mid_article_caption tl-caption"" style=""color:#222;text-align:left !important;display: -webkit-box;-webkit-line-clamp: 3;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;overflow: hidden;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;"">

I actually got a better job than the girl who brought me there had.""</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider made an effort to learn everything she could as quickly as possible.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“It was amazing how well I took to the whole thing. I loved it. I absolutely loved it. It was perfect for me. I had never been out of school my whole life. I was either a student or in school teaching or consulting. It’s like the world opened up for me.” </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Within six months, Schneider went from knowing nothing about the markets to being hired as an analyst and then subsequently promoted to a broker.  </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“To be on the floor in the heyday of commodities back in the 80s was an amazing education,” she says. “I learned so many things about the markets and how the markets move. It was a full-on five-sense experience. Now people sit and they watch a computer screen. I could hear, smell, touch, taste what was going on and I think that’s really what molded me as a trader. It taught me to think on my feet and look at the market from all dimensions.”</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider was one of the first female traders on the <u><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/commodities"" target=""_blank"">commodities<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></u> floor on Wall Street. While some men welcomed her presence, some did not. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“It was like a typical environment as you’d see anywhere,” she says. “I had guys that were like my father and protected me. I had guys that were like my sons and came to me for advice. Guys who were just like my friends who just wanted to hang out and guys that avoided me like the plague. Then there were also a few guys that were questionable in terms of their behavior towards me.”</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider recalled one colleague in particular with whom she had issues.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“There was one guy who really hated me being there,” she says. “He and his gang of friends would say, 'Hey Mish, why aren’t you home vacuuming?” </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider says he disliked her presence so much that he brought her up on charges of using point-and-figure charts to track price movements in the ring. She used charts in part because it was difficult to physically compete with the men in the ring and track the order flow. The charges led to her first real test in front of the Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa membership committee.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“They ruled in my favor,” Schneider says. “That was a real feather in the cap. So even though I got flak from a lot of the other guys, I was now legitimate.” </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider worked at various exchanges through the years, including the COMEX, NYMEX and Finex. She says her experience gave her a lot of insight into men's behavior. She observed that when men are in high-stress situations with lots of action, they tend to be very physical with each other.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“I realized I should never be upset if somebody smacked me on the back. Not hard to hurt me, but tousled me about and said, 'Hey Mish, how are you doing?' I never got upset by that. I allowed myself to be nonjudgmental about their behavior and that really helped a lot.” </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Schneider says not only did she have to learn how to deal with the differences in physicality with the men on the floor; she also had to navigate the party atmosphere of the 1980s.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“I don’t need to tell you how much partying there was in the 80s,” she says. “With the champagne flowing and the cocaine in the bathroom, I had to say to myself, what kind of Mish do I want to be here? I didn’t want to be a stick in the mud, but I didn’t want to be Mish the party girl. So I kind of stayed right in the middle. It was an interesting experience.”</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">After trading commodities for 13 years, Schneider's career has come full circle. She is currently the <u><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/business-leaders"" target=""_blank"">director of trading education<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></u> at <u><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.marketgauge.com/"" target=""_blank"">MarketGauge.com<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></u>. Schneider says the role has allowed her to combine her education background along with all that she has learned on Wall Street.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">She has also written the book “Plant Your Money Tree: A Guide to Growing Your Wealth” with the goal of teaching the average person how to grow their money and make smart money decisions.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“I think I’m just a teacher, I can’t help myself,” says Schneider. “I’m not teaching kids in a school anymore, but I get tremendous satisfaction out of teaching people and then getting the wonderful feedback I’ve gotten through the years.” </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><em>Linda Bell joined FOX Business Network (FBN) in 2014 as an assignment editor.

They said, ‘Sir, you don’t have to shake any hands, some people do that,’” Trump told the audience. </p>, <p>“You can shake one hand, to the one person, top of the class. You can shake 10, 50 or 100, and you could also stay for 1,000, OK?” Trump said to cheers. </p>, <p>During his commencement, Trump told the graduating cadets: “To dominate the future, America must rule the skies.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Trump responds to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's public statement on the Russia investigation; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">President Trump and his defenders can successfully attack <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"">former Special Counsel Robert Mueller </a>or congressional Democrats on impeachment – but not both. The independent voters who will decide the 2020 election don’t have time for multiple sets of arguments. </p>, <p class=""speakable"">Moreover, independent voters have limited interest in all things political. So <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump"">the president </a>and his advocates should keep it simple and focus on Congress, not Mueller, who resigned Wednesday. </p>, <p>Mueller didn’t say anything when he spoke to journalists Wednesday that hadn’t already appeared in his report. That was the point of his news conference. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-mueller-wants-to-see-trump-impeached-and-dems-are-likely-to-oblige"">TUCKER CARLSON: MUELLER WANTS TO SEE TRUMP IMPEACHED - AND DEMS ARE LIKELY TO OBLIGE</a></strong></p>, <p>Mueller was directing his statement at Democrats who want him to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. His message was clear: If you compel me to appear, I won’t say anything you couldn’t read in my report. It speaks for itself.</p>, <p>After a redacted version of the Mueller report was released in April, President Trump’s approval numbers stabilized and polls began showing a growing number of Americans oppose any further action on impeachment of the president. </p>, <p>Indeed, the May 1 Harvard CAPS Harris survey found 65 percent of the public disagreed with the statement that “Democrats in Congress should initiate impeachment proceedings against President Trump.” </p>, <p>The same poll found that 60 percent of the public agreed with the decision by Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that “the facts and public actions of President Trump did not amount to obstruction of justice, especially since there was no underlying collusion</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">A vote on impeaching the president could increase the antagonism between the Democratic Party’s pro-impeachment faction and Democrats who view impeachment as a losing issue.</p>, <p>These are the best arguments for President Trump and his defenders to make. Many Americans oppose impeachment because they don’t want the country plunged into an unnecessary crisis. They also oppose impeachment because there was no collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians in the 2016 presidential election. </p>, <p>As a result, the president’s actions did not have “corrupt intent,” which is a requirement for an obstruction of justice charge. Trump was upset at being investigated when he knew he was innocent of accusations that he worked with the Russians to get to the Oval Office.</p>, <p>If Democrats want to argue that corrupt intent and an underlying offense are not needed to prove obstruction, then was former President Bill Clinton committing obstruction when he met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix Airport while the FBI was investigating his wife’s mishandling of government emails?</p>, <p>Or was former President Barack Obama committing obstruction when he opined that Hillary Clinton had done nothing wrong with her emails while she was his secretary of state?</p>, <p>Both Presidents Obama and Clinton acted before then-FBI Director James Comey announced his recommendation that Hillary Clinton – then running for president against Trump – should not be charged for improperly using a private email server instead of the required secure government email system while heading the State Department. </p>, <p>Knowing what they know today, if House Democrats move forward on the impeachment of President Trump, five things will happen. </p>, <p>First, swing voters will conclude the Democrats are conducting a highly partisan exercise. </p>, <p>Second, impeachment talk will largely or completely obscure anything else House Democrats will do legislatively. Voters could decide the Democrats are a do-nothing bunch. </p>, <p>Third, impeachment will play a much larger role in the Democratic presidential primary. The issue of impeachment will obscure the other messages of the Democratic presidential hopefuls and raise the prospect of a backlash against candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who have yet to embrace impeachment. </p>, <p>Fourth, the Republican Senate will quickly dismiss any impeachment resolution passed by the House, killing the issue. </p>, <p>And finally, any of the dozens of vulnerable House Democrats in Republican-leaning districts who back impeachment will have given their GOP opponents a big issue.</p>, <p>Though neither is guaranteed, two other things might happen if House Democrats move to impeach Trump.  A vote on impeaching the president could increase the antagonism between the Democratic Party’s pro-impeachment faction and Democrats who view impeachment as a losing issue.</p>, <p>And rather than inflaming Democrats, the GOP Senate’s virtually certain decision to kill any impeachment resolution could cause a significant number of discouraged Democrats to stay home on Election Day. Democrats strongly opposed to Trump might feel their party did not fight early, hard or effectively enough to impeach the president. </p>, <p>So the president and his defenders should stop paying attention to Mueller and his Wednesday news conference. </p>, <p>Unintentionally (because he’s a law enforcement professional and not political), Mueller’s actions again disappointed the Democratic firebrands who want Trump impeached. In the same way, the Mueller report failed to live up to the expectations of the Democratic Party’s Dump Trump wing. </p>, <p>Still, I think Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff of California, Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters of California and some other Democrats will keep pressing for impeachment.</p>, <p>But imagine how Americans might react to the Democratic argument that the president should be removed from office because he obstructed justice when there was no underlying offense to hide, and no corrupt intent behind his demands regarding the Mueller investigation that were issued out of frustration and never carried out. </p>, <p>Swing voters want the federal government to work. They want Congress and the president to focus on the big challenges America faces, not to spend all their energy in hyper-partisan activity. </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., doesn’t want to put her majority at risk by plunging into impeachment.

Boston Harbor <a href=""https://www.worldoil.com/news/2018/12/28/amid-export-boom-us-still-imports-natural-gas-from-russia"">regularly</a> sees tankers from Russia.</p>, <p>Why?</p>, <p>This seems contradictory. Natural gas production in the United States has reached <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38692"">record</a> highs. In a recent visit to a new $10 billion liquid natural gas export (LNG) terminal, President Trump <a href=""https://www.apnews.com/b75911009f0e4982b6557ccbb588f357"">touted</a> the facility’s importance in dominating the world energy markets.</p>, <p>This is not good news to the radical green movement.</p>, <p>For years, environmentalists have worked to influence energy policy in the Northeast. There, they have used their tremendous wealth and power to push radical green policies on politicians who enact their agenda regardless of its environmental and economic consequences.</p>, <p>There's no better example of such a puppet politician than Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>, <p>Since 2014 Cuomo has banned hydraulic fracking in the state, parroting environmental activist talking points that it would cause “adverse health outcomes.”</p>, <p>As 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper will tell you, that’s nonsense. A geologist by training, Hickenlooper has <a href=""https://www.cred.org/governor-hickenlooper-agrees-fracking-good-colorado/"">said</a> that fracking is “remarkably safe,” and proved it by <a href=""https://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2013/feb/12/colorado-gov-hickenlooper-i-drank-fracking-fluid/"">drinking</a> fracking fluid himself.</p>, <p>But facts never stop Cuomo.

It would be incredibly difficult to obstruct justice without an underlying crime, a fact Mueller confirmed again this week.</p>, <p>With the economy doing so well, and the unemployment rate so low, the Democratic leadership cannot give in to the loudest liberal voices in the party.</p>, <p>Instead, Democrats need to focus on the issues that Americans are actually concerned about.

In my dual roles, I see the issues we face on our southern, northern and coastal borders, and I’m an eyewitness to the national emergency taking place on our border with Mexico.  </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-escalating-illegal-immigrants-stop""><strong>TRUMP ANNOUNCES ESCALATING TARIFFS AGAINST MEXICO, STARTING AT 5 PERCENT, UNTIL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'STOP'</strong></a></p>, <p>This is why I fully support the president’s decision on increasing tariffs and his other actions to secure our border and enforce our immigration laws.</p>, <p>President tweeted Thursday night: ""On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, ... ….at which time the Tariffs will be removed.”</p>, <p>""If Mexico still has not taken action to dramatically reduce or eliminate the number of illegal aliens crossing its territory into the United States, Tariffs will be increased to 15 percent on August 1, 2019, to 20 percent on September 1, 2019, and to 25 percent on October 1, 2019,"" the president said in a statement released later by the White House. ""Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory.""</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">As a Border Patrol agent and as the current president of the National Border Patrol Council – the exclusive labor representative of approximately 16,000 Border Patrol agents – I know first-hand the consequences of an unsecure border.</p>, <p>Make no mistake, the choice of how high the tariffs will go and how long they will remain will be up to the government of Mexico.  </p>, <p>Unfortunately, for President Trump’s entire time in office Congress has refused to work with him to finally secure our borders. </p>, <p>In my 22-year career as a Border Patrol agent I’ve worked under both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations, and under a House and Senate controlled at different times by Democrats and Republicans. During that time, I have never seen Congress refuse to fund border security – until now.</p>, <p>The congressional inaction we are now witnessing is made worse by Mexico’s refusal to enforce its own immigration laws, which are actually much stronger than our own. These two failures – as well as the ongoing emergency at our southern border caused by a dramatic rise in illegal immigration – have prompted President Trump to act wisely and unilaterally in America’s best interests.</p>, <p>Although other presidents have vowed to secure our borders, it is President Trump who is actually following through. But he must have congressional support for necessary spending and improvements in our laws to accomplish this vital mission.</p>, <p>Some members of Congress who are the president’s political opponents know this, and as a result, will continue to stonewall, turn a blind eye, and advocate for those who illegally enter our country rather than for those whom they’re elected to represent.</p>, <p>I recently completed a voluntary 30-day detail to process illegal immigrants at the epicenter of the illegal immigration national emergency – the Rio Grande Valley Border Patrol Sector’s Central Processing Center in Texas.</p>, <p>While at the center, I interviewed and processed families with children as young as 2-years-old who came to the U.S. from their home countries – mainly Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.</p>, <p>It was clear to me that the incentive these illegal immigrants have of being released into the United States with a years-away future immigration court hearing date far outweigh the benefits of remaining in their home countries.</p>, <p>It’s that incentive – or the lack of a deterrent – that has managed to turn the immigration crisis into a national emergency.</p>, <p>With the Border Patrol apprehending record numbers of illegal border crossers from countries other than Mexico – and the lack of funding to properly detain, process and house them – we are in unchartered territory. Congress knows this as well as President Trump, yet the president is the only one willing to tackle this problem head-on and solve it.</p>, <p>Many congressional delegations have visited our southern border, specifically to the hotspots in the Rio Grande Valley and El Paso. But far too many lawmakers refuse to admit that they can help President Trump fix this problem.  </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Immigration should not be a partisan issue. It is irresponsible to ignore immigration laws approved in years past by both Democratic and Republican elected officials and to simply open our borders with no safeguards to millions of people who would like to come to our country.</p>, <p>This is why I urge Congress to act in the best interests of our nation and the American people by joining with President Trump to fix our immigration laws. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""http://CLICK%20HERE%20TO%20GET%20THE%20FOX%20NEWS%20APP"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY BRANDON JUDD</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Voters in Georgia elected lawmakers who represent their values, and that's exactly how democratic systems are designed to work. That's the point.</p>, <p>You'd think the people who claim to be defending our democracy from the Russians would understand that. But of course, they don't understand it.

That company currently films a number of shows in Georgia. If the state doesn't repeal its abortion law, Netflix says it will pull out.</p>, <p>This is all a remarkable change in American life in a very short period of time. It wasn't that long ago that it was citizens who boycotted companies they disagreed with. Now, it's corporations who boycott citizens.</p>, <p>What happened? It's not hard to figure out what happened. For generations, consumers and voters held the real power in this country, but not anymore. Now corporations are in charge, and they're happy to boss you around on behalf of the activist left. They'll lie about it, of course, and tell you it's all a matter of conscience. Right. As if they had consciences.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Netflix, for example, filmed its show ""Marco Polo"" in Malaysia. In case you haven't visited Malaysia recently, being gay is a crime there. Most of that country lives under Sharia law. Of course, abortion is also restricted in Malaysia, just as it is in Colombia, where Netflix filmed its show ""Narcos."" But the company didn't seem bothered by that.</p>, <p>Disney, by the way, just filmed its upcoming live-action ""Mulan"" film in China, which is safe to say in a police state, where huge parts of the internet are banned, and people are executed for having the wrong opinions. And in some cases, abortion is mandatory.</p>, <p>So, no, Disney and Netflix aren't really worried about anyone's rights, no matter what their flacks claim. Their real concern -- their only concern -- is power. Women with children might be tempted to put the needs of their own families before those who are shareholders. Abortion solves that problem.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The tyranny of ""woke"" capital is real, and it is terrifying. Just because they're selling you products, doesn't mean it's not a dictatorship. </p>, <p>Family shrinks or disappears entirely. Women are free to devote their lives to the company -- reliable little worker bees. Corporations get to expand their labor pool, lower wages and increase profits, all while delivering pious lectures about how they're giving women opportunities. ""We're feminists now!"" It's a grotesque scam. But it's remarkably effective.</p>, <p>Somewhere in the late 1990s, corporate America realized this. They learned that if they did the bidding of the left on social issues, they would get a pass on everything else. They could freeze wages. They could destroy the environment. They could strangle free speech. They can eliminate privacy. In general, they could make public life much worse.</p>, <p>All the while, they could get richer than any class of people in human history, and nobody would say anything. So that's exactly what they did, and they're still doing it.</p>, <p>Salesforce is a major tech company that sells software mostly to businesses. On Thursday, Salesforce announced that it won't work with customers who sell semi-automatic firearms or magazines that hold what gun control groups say are too many rounds.</p>, <p>Last year, Citigroup announced it would not allow stores that sell semi-automatic weapons to use their credit card services. That's where we are today. But it's not hard to match what it might be like tomorrow.</p>, <p>What if, for example, America -- corporate America -- decided to punish gun owners in addition to gun sellers? You've got a firearm at home, so you could no longer buy car insurance. Okay, you can't use Facebook. You can't open a checking account. You can't have a credit card. You can't stay in hotels.</p>, <p>Well, libertarians will tell you that's just fine - just the free market at work. If you don't like it, open your own credit card company.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Panel reaction and analysis on New York Times op-ed by former Obama treasury adviser Steven Rattner.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Some believe that <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy"" target=""_blank"">President Trump’s economic reforms</a> are only benefiting the country’s “one percent.” But in reality, the pro-growth policy agenda being pursued by the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"" target=""_blank"">current administration</a> is helping the Americans who need it most.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Recent data validates this claim. While wages have begun to climb across all segments of society, recent figures show that those in the bottom 25 percent of wage-earners – or Americans making roughly $20,000 or less – are experiencing the most rapid pay increases. This group has seen their paychecks swell by over 4 percent during the last year.</p>, <p>Additionally, wage growth for blue-collar workers continues to surpass the rate of their supervisors and managers month after month.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-voters-feel-good-about-economy-say-tariffs-will-hurt"" target=""_blank"">FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS FEEL GOOD ABOUT ECONOMY, SAY TARIFFS WILL HURT</a></strong></p>, <p>Wage growth is not the only economic indicator that has performed well in recent years.</p>, <p>The overall unemployment rate – one of the more popular barometers of economic health – is at a five-decade low. In addition to being a figure economists repeat on television, the rock-bottom rate indicates that most people who want a job have one – a circumstance that is confirmed by recent Job Creators Network/ScottRasmussen.com polling. The data reveals less than one-fifth of Americans are concerned with business layoffs in their area. </p>, <p>A closer examination of more demographic-specific unemployment information reveals an even more impressive story.</p>, <p>Hispanic-Americans are experiencing the lowest unemployment rate in recorded history. The African-American unemployment rate is hovering near an all-time low. The unemployment rate for Americans who have a high-school diploma hit a decade low. The percent of unemployed workers with disabilities has improved. And the unemployment rate for women has hit the lowest level since 1953 and is even outperforming that of their male peers. </p>, <p>The combination of a low unemployment rate and accelerating wage growth has persuaded many Americans to get off the sidelines and enter the labor force. This development can be observed in the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers – which has rebounded from the Great Recession-induced dip.</p>, <p>It couldn’t be more evident that all Americans – despite race, gender or socioeconomic status – are making headway in this economic environment.</p>, <p>But what’s behind this economic progress that’s surging from the ground up? Sound free-market policies that are expanding financial independence for individuals and businesses, as well as opening up new career opportunities for those looking to enter the labor force.</p>, <p>Exhibit A is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) – legislation implemented in 2018 that generated significant financial savings for individuals and businesses alike. Businesses, specifically small ones, are now subject to lower tax rates and are encouraged to expand and hire new employees through additional policy components – including the immediate expensing of capital equipment and small business standard deduction.</p>, <p>In regards to individuals, it’s been estimated that 90 percent of wage-earners experienced savings as a result of the TCJA. And according to the Heritage Foundation, the average family of four saved $3,000.</p>, <p>Improvements in the regulatory arena have also helped spur the recent economic success. In 2017, President Trump directed federal agencies to address the over-regulation that was unnecessarily burdening the economy. More specifically, agencies were to eliminate two regulations for every new one added. The impact has been greater than many imagined – with four regulations cut for every new one created in 2018.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Over the course of the following two years, net regulatory costs were reduced by over $30 billion – an improvement that frees up time and reduces compliance costs for businesses across the country.</p>, <p>Some are bashing the current administration for policy pursuits they claim are only enriching the elite. However, it couldn’t be more clear that the robust economy – a result of Trump's policies – is providing a lifeline to all Americans.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/elaine-parker"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ELAINE PARKER</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

          <span>(Bohovesky family photo)</span></p>, <p class=""speakable"">Paula Bohovesky, aspiring actress and high school honor student.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">New York state lawmakers are calling on <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/andrew-cuomo"" target=""_blank"">Gov. Andrew Cuomo</a> to block the release of a man convicted in the 1980 murder of a 16-year-old girl in a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime"" target=""_blank"">crime so depraved</a> it stunned law enforcement and shook a close-knit community to its core.</p>, <p>Paula Bohovesky, an aspiring actress and high school honor student, was beaten, s<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime"" target=""_blank"">exually assaulted</a> and stabbed to death as she walked home from a local library in the quiet hamlet of Pearl River, N.Y., a village 40 miles north of New York City.</p>, <p>A jury convicted Richard LaBarbera and Robert McCain of second-degree murder in 1981, and the two men were sentenced to 25 years to life in prison – the toughest sentence possible at that time.</p>, <p>On Wednesday, a parole board of Cuomo appointees informed Bohovesky’s family that LaBarbera will be released in July – a move that shocked victim advocates, state lawmakers and the girl’s mother, who said in a statement released by a family friend: “It’s all about the state’s decision to reduce the prison population.”</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/board-recommends-clemency-for-brother-of-acclaimed-author"" target=""_blank"">BOARD RECOMMENDS CLEMENCY FOR BROTHER OF ACCLAIMED AUTHOR</a></strong></p>, <p>LaBarbera, 66, who was out on parole for a drug-related offense at the time of the killing, has never claimed responsibility for Bohovesky’s death – a common prerequisite before a criminal is released. Neither has McCain, 58, who goes before the same parole board in June.</p>, <p>“Both of these killers never expressed remorse, regret, shame or accepted responsibility for this beastly crime,” said John Murphy, a former longtime Rockland County legislator whose children attended school with Bohovesky at Pearl River High School. </p>, <p>“This was an appalling, animalistic act,” said Murphy, who founded a non-profit group called, “Petition for Paula,” more than a decade ago. Every two years, the charity collects thousands of signatures to present to the parole board in opposition of the men’s release.</p>, <p>“This is a time-sensitive situation. We need people to call the governor’s office because this is appalling and inhumane,” Murphy told Fox News. “We cannot have this happen to another child.”</p>, <p>Ed Day, a Rockland County executive, echoed calls for Cuomo to intervene.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/v/6043198495001/#sp=show-clips"" target=""_blank"">BLOOD, OTHER EVIDENCE FOUND AT HOME OF MISSING CONNECTICUT MOM</a></strong></p>, <p>“The governor should immediately rescind the decision of the parole board,” said Day, who served with the New York City Police Department for 25 years before becoming an elected official.</p>, <p>“This is one of the most heinous crimes I have ever known about, and I dealt with some pretty bad ones,” Day said. “Given the depravity and the cruelty of this crime, I was shocked that he [LaBarbera] was paroled.”</p>, <p>Fox News contacted Cuomo’s office on Friday for comment, but did not receive a direct response to the growing calls for the governor to intervene. Instead, a statement from Thomas Mailey, spokesperson for the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, suggested the New York State Board of Parole is ""the sole entity that considers and determines parole eligibility... whose members have been nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate.""<br/>
 <br/>
Mailey explained in his statement that ""[by] law, before making a final decision, the Board members must follow statutory requirements which take ‎into consideration many factors, including statements made by victims and victims’ families, as well as an individual’s criminal history, institutional accomplishments, potential to successfully reintegrate into the community, and perceived danger to public safety.” Mailey said Board members “base their decisions on whether the standards for release are satisfied.  Additionally, by statute, the Board considers any recommendations concerning release to Community Supervision from the district attorney, sentencing court and the defense attorney.""</p>, <p>The details of Bohovesky’s murder are brutal.</p>, <p>Shortly after 7 p.m. on Oct. 28, 1980, the girl left her part-time job at the Pearl River library and walked through the center of town toward her home on Hunt Street. The teen was within one block of her parents’ house when LaBarbera and McCain – both of whom had been drinking at the High Wheeler bar nearby – grabbed Bohovesky and dragged her behind a house on the corner of an intersection. McCain attempted to rape Bohovesky, while LaBarbera watched, according to police. When the girl fought back, McCain crushed her skull with a chunk of pavement.</p>, <p>Believing that Bohovesky was dead, LaBarbera then tried to sodomize the child. When she stirred, to his surprise, LaBarbera stabbed her with a knife five times in the back, killing her, police told Fox News.</p>, <p>“She fought them off to her death,” said Murphy.</p>, <p>By 10 p.m., when Bohovesky failed to return home, her parents reported her missing and a manhunt was quickly underway through the streets of Pearl River. Bohovesky’s body was discovered face down behind the home the next morning. </p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>Kevin Nulty, the longtime Orangetown Police Chief, was a young patrol officer in Pearl River at the time of the murder.</p>, <p>“It was heartless,” said Nulty, who is now retired.</p>, <p>“This happened at what was probably the safest intersection in town,” he told Fox News. “It changed our town forever. It’s like a whole generation of parents never forgot what happened that night.”</p>, <p>“She was a very beautiful girl and a highly accomplished artist,” Nulty said of Bohovesky.</p>, <p>The outrage over LaBarbera’s reported release extends beyond Rockland County. Many New York lawmakers say the state is determined to lower the prison population and, in doing so, has adopted a system that puts the criminal before the victim.</p>, <p>In a statement released to Fox News on Friday, state Senate Republican leader John Flanagan fiercely criticized the decision to release LaBarbera.</p>, <p>Flanagan also cited another highly controversial move by the same parole board: the decision to release Judith Clark, a former Weather Underground radical who drove the getaway car in the infamous 1981 Brink’s heist, during which two police officers and a guard were killed. Clark was granted parole in April after serving more than 37 years in a New York prison. In 2016, Gov. Cuomo commuted Clark’s 75-years-to-life sentence and made her eligible for parole.</p>, <p>“Put simply, this is a disgraceful act by the Parole Board, and it adds to the growing list of killers that have recently been released – killers like Herman Bell, Judith Clark, and Matthew Solomon,” Flanagan said. “They’re likely not finished, either, as LaBarbera’s equally guilty and equally vicious accomplice is up for parole next month.”</p>, <p>“None of this would be happening if not for Governor Cuomo’s handpicked appointees, who have repeatedly ignored the voices of victims and their families in favor of the most vicious criminals in our society,” he said. “Shame on the parole board, shame on Governor Cuomo, and shame on the Democrats in the state legislature for allowing this madness to continue.”</p>, <p>“I believe in due process but there seems to be a push in New York state to get people out of jail,” added Nulty, who retired as police chief last month.</p>, <p>“For low-level crimes, that might make sense sometimes, but for violent crimes, it’s not worth the risk that another innocent child could be victimized,” he said.</p>, <p>The Bohovesky family, meanwhile, is hoping that the call to block LaBarbera’s release will be heard by Cuomo. Bohovesky’s mother, Lois, has spent the last 39 years ensuring her daughter’s killers remain in prison.</p>, <p>At trial, Bohovesky’s father, Basil, who died in 1987, wrote to the judge: ""Many generations will have to pass to bring us another like Paula.""</p>, <p>""Paula's physical beauty was ethereal and reminiscent of ancient art. She carried herself with grace and serenity. She was proud of her womanhood and walked straight and tall,"" wrote Bohovesky. ""She was modest and generous and a friend to the friendless ... She was just starting to realize the joy of fulfillment in her work.""</p>, <p>""Paula should have lived to be a mother. She should have lived to be a grandmother,"" he wrote. ""We have lost her and her splendid progeny.""</p>, <p><em>Fox News Investigative Producer Alex Diaz contributed to this report.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Some of the investigators I know had struggled to return to their jobs and go about investigations the same way.”</p>, <p>The terrifying turn of events first occurred with the disappearance of Shanann Watts and the children in August. But within days, the patriarch was arrested and then pleaded guilty in exchange for prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. At the time, Watts didn’t provide a full account of what occurred or his motives.</p>, <p>

However, he later admitted that was a lie and he was solely responsible for the murders.</p>, <p>According to Watts, he strangled Shanann in their bed on Aug. 14 after he told her their marriage was over and she allegedly said he would never see their children again. He said his wife suspected he was having an affair, which was true. However, Watts claimed he didn’t tell her about the ongoing relationship with a co-worker before killing her.</p>, <p>

Still, the relationship may have “contributed” to his actions.</p>, <p>Wrenn said the first responders weren’t the only ones shaken by Watts’ actions.</p>, <p>“[Also] those who had to attend the autopsies the next day,” said Wrenn. “Those of us who had to sit and be frustrated by the fact that Chris Watts refused to tell us the truth in the initial interview. We knew he was lying, we knew he was involved. We wanted to find those kids and find Shanann. We knew he held the answers to those questions. His denials and the arrogance contained within those denials — I don’t know if I’ve ever been more frustrated in my life watching something take place.”</p>, <p>Watts confessed that after he strangled Shanann, Bella came into the couples’ bedroom clutching a blanket, asking what was wrong with her mother. Watts responded the matriarch wasn’t feeling well. Bella then watched as Watts wrapped the body in a bed sheet and started crying when he pulled it down the stairs of their home. Watts said he put the corpse on the floor of his truck’s back set. Celeste then woke up from the commotion.</p>, <p>

Each child had their own blanket and Celeste also brought along a stuffed animal.</p>, <p>Watts drove to about 40 miles east of the family’s home in Frederick to an oil worksite where he worked as an operator for an oil and gas producer. Watts told police he pulled Shanann’s body from the truck while the girls asked, “What are you doing to mommy?”</p>, <p>Watts then said he went back to the truck and used Celeste’s blanket to smother her as Bella watched from a seat beside her sister. Then, he put Celeste’s body inside an oil tank. He then returned to the truck and smothered Bella using the same blanket. He told police Bella’s last words were “Daddy, no!” as she struggled under the blanket. He then put her body inside another oil tank and buried Shanann's body nearby.</p>, <p>Watts alleged he did not plan to murder his family.</p>, <p>
      According to court documents released, Shanann Watts' body was found in a shallow grave near this oil tank Aug. 21, 2018, near Roggen, Colorado.

It’s nonsensical. It’s so contrary to everything we know about human nature. And for that reason, the why is never going to be satisfying.”</p>, <p>

Our initial instinct is to want to understand the why. I don’t think a documentary is capable of providing that answer, but maybe it will shed some light on the bigger picture… the factual backdrop in which such a horrific act can be committed.""</p>, <p>“When you looked into his day-to-day activities, the guy would get up, go to work, go home, play with his kids, talk on the phone with his buddies about fantasy football, send text messages throughout the day to his wife about their weekend plans — we can all relate to that lifestyle,” he added. “That’s different from what we normally see in criminal investigations. It’s hard to relate to the people we are investigating because their lives often look so different from ours.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler responds to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's statement.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Nadler</a> said Friday “there certainly is” justification for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump, but said it was critical for the American public to agree before launching the process.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">During an interview on WNYC, Nadler, whose committee would lead<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-mueller-as-highly-conflicted-after-special-counsel-makes-rare-public-statement"" target=""_blank""> impeachment </a>proceedings, cautioned the move, noting the importance of having the American public on board first.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-mueller-as-highly-conflicted-after-special-counsel-makes-rare-public-statement"" target=""_blank""><strong>TRUMP BLASTS MUELLER AS 'HIGHLY CONFLICTED,' CALLS IMPEACHMENT A 'DIRTY, FILTHY, DISGUSTING WORD'</strong></a></p>, <p>“Impeachment is a political act, and you cannot impeach a president if the American people will not support it,” said Nadler, D-N.Y. “The American people, right now, do not support it because they do not know the story. They don’t know the facts.”</p>, <p>Nadler added: “We have to get the facts out. We have to hold a series of hearings, we have to hold the investigations.”</p>, <p>Nadler also vowed to hold televised hearings to “have a dialogue with the American people so people can make informed decisions and know what’s going on.”</p>, <p>“It’s very important that [Special Counsel Robert Mueller], to a television audience and to the American people, state [his findings] and answer questions about it, even if there is no new information,” Nadler said.</p>, <p>Nadler’s comments come after Mueller made a rare public appearance Wednesday—his first and only during his tenure as special counsel. Mueller announced the Russia investigation was officially closed, and his resignation from the Justice Department, and intention to return to private life.</p>, <p>Despite Nadler’s comments Friday, though, Mueller said he did not plan to testify before any congressional committees.</p>, <p>“I hope and expect this to be the only time I will speak to you on this matter,” Mueller told reporters Wednesday. “No one has told me whether I can or should testify or speak further about this matter.”</p>, <p>“There has been discussion about an appearance before Congress,” he continued. “Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself.”</p>, <p>Attorney General Bill Barr on Friday defended Mueller’s intention not to testify before Congress.</p>, <p>“It’s up to Bob, but I think the line he’s drawing, which is he’s going to stick to what’s in the report, is the proper line for any department official,” Barr told CBS News Friday.</p>, <p>Mueller’s appearance on Wednesday prompted congressional Democrats to more seriously discuss potential impeachment proceedings against the president. Mueller detailed the findings in his probe, maintaining that there was “not sufficient evidence to charge a conspiracy” with regard to whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.</p>, <p>But Mueller did not mince words on his inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice.</p>, <p>“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that,” Mueller said. “We did not determine whether the president did commit a crime.”</p>, <p>Mueller explained the longstanding Justice Department policy, which states that a sitting president cannot be charged with a crime, and thus said “charging the president was not an option we could consider.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-has-not-received-satisfactory-answers-from-intelligence-community-in-review-of-origins-of-russia-probe"" target=""_blank""><strong>BARR HAS NOT RECEIVED 'SATISFACTORY' ANSWERS FROM INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY IN RUSSIA PROBE ORIGINS REVIEW</strong></a></p>, <p>Mueller added that “it would be unfair to accuse someone of a crime when there could be no court resolution of the charge.”</p>, <p>But Mueller said that while the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion blocks a president from indictment while in office, “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing.”</p>, <p>Some on the left took that comment as a green light to ramp up talks about impeachment proceedings against the president.</p>, <p>But despite growing calls from rank-and-file Democrats, party leadership, including Nadler and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have treaded lightly on the topic, vowing to investigate allegations against the president, but stopping short of calling to begin impeachment proceedings.</p>, <p>Following Mueller’s public statement, Nadler vowed that Congress would “respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump.”</p>, <p>“No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law,” Nadler said Wednesday.</p>, <p>Pelosi, this week, also said that Democrats “want to do what’s right and what gets results.”</p>, <p>“We’re legislating, we’re investigating and we’re litigating,” Pelosi said. “Everybody wants justice, everybody wants the president to be held accountable.”</p>, <p>Trump, though, blasted the idea as a “scam.”</p>, <p>“I don’t see how they can,” Trump said Thursday. “It’s a dirty, filthy, disgusting word, impeach. It’s high crimes –there was no high crime. So how do you impeach?”</p>, <p>But even without launching official impeachment proceedings, congressional Democrats are leading several high-profile Trump-focused investigations. Nadler’s committee is investigating the administration’s handling of Mueller’s report, and even voted to hold Barr in contempt for defying a subpoena requiring that he turn over an unredacted version of Mueller’s report, and its underlying evidence and documents. The president, in turn, asserted executive privilege over the files in a bid to protect them from release.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, the House Intelligence Committee, Oversight Committee, Ways and Means Committee and Financial Services Committee are all investigating the president and have aggressively sought his financial statements and documents for their probes, as well as testimony from high-profile Trump administration officials.</p>, <p>Thus far, the White House has directed the officials to defy their subpoenas to appear before Congress, and the president has vowed to block “all” subpoenas.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

The first rule of any good party? The more Captains the better. Party on, Cap-TAN. Party on. #LikeACaptain
</p>, <p>This could be (and should be) a potent campaign theme. A gutsy rival could go after Biden, who with much fanfare just rolled out an education policy that pandered to the teachers unions and shamefully embraced the status quo in our public schools. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-bidens-campaign-pace-called-into-question"" target=""_blank"">WHERE'S JOE? BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN PACE CALLED INTO QUESTION</a></strong></p>, <p>Supporting a system that graduates class after class of minority kids who can’t read or do simple math, who cannot succeed in college or in life, is criminal. Even <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama"" target=""_blank"">President Obama</a> briefly stood up to the unions, until they threatened to withhold their support for his reelection in 2012.</p>, <p>Obama knew, as everyone knows, that the impossibility of firing poor teachers, the ignoring of measures of success and a constant push to lower standards – the so-called bigotry of low expectations – destroys opportunity for too many black and brown children.</p>, <p>In his recent address, Biden vowed to throw more money at our public schools, even though insufficient funding is hardly the problem. The U.S. spends 30 percent more per pupil than the average OECD country and yet we fall in the bottom 15th percentile of developed nations in student achievement. </p>, <p>In particular, the former vice president promised to triple the money the federal government allocates to low-income schools, which would allow generous pay hikes for teachers. Nothing could cheer union hearts more or, without changes in how our inner city schools operate, prove less productive. </p>, <p>Biden attacked charters by repeating the traditional complaint that they divert money from public institutions; that is true, but they also produce better results. That’s why more than 50,000 families are wait-listed for charter schools in New York, for instance. </p>, <p>It’s no accident that Biden revealed his education policy at a forum hosted by the American Federation of Teachers, which gave out $34 million in political contributions in 2016, almost all of it going to Hillary Clinton and fellow Democrats. That sum doesn’t include the enormous get-out-the-vote efforts and on the ground organizing the teachers unions provide.</p>, <p>All Democrats are competing for the unions’ endorsement, but Biden needs it more than most, and it showed. Even the liberal Washington Post, said Biden’s “Pitch was as much that of a union booster as of a would-be education president.”</p>, <p>Biden is especially desperate to bring the teachers unions aboard because he was late jumping into the crowded race, and has built only a rudimentary campaign effort. He needs those millions of teachers ringing doorbells and handing out flyers because he hasn’t got much of a team. The Des Moines Register reports that in Iowa, for instance, Joe Biden has four paid campaign staffers while rival Elizabeth Warren has over 50 and Bernie Sanders’ “Army” claims 20,000 volunteers. </p>, <p>Biden’s late entry and weak campaign apparatus may be just the beginnings of his problems. Though he still commands a lead in the crowded field, the gap has shrunk from a few weeks ago. </p>, <p class=""quote-text"">In his recent address, Biden vowed to throw more money at our public schools, even though insufficient funding is hardly the problem. The U.S. spends 30 percent more per pupil than the average OECD country and yet we fall in the bottom 15th percentile of developed nations in student achievement.  </p>, <p>But Biden’s decline has been (inevitably) exacerbated by his near-invisibility, his failure to divulge his policies and by questions raised over his past positions. Now his rivals can go after his education approach as well, and especially his out-of-touch stance on charters.</p>, <p>The NAACP has opposed charter schools as a matter of policy but their unity on the topic is showing cracks. In recent weeks, NAACP branches in three California cities with large black populations bucked the national organization and their state’s leadership by demanding an end to the moratorium on charters that the group adopted in 2016.</p>, <p>In pressing their case, the dissonant NAACP group wrote in a resolution that “In the top 10 California school districts with the highest enrollment of African-American students – including San Diego, San Bernardino and Moreno Valley Unified in Riverside County – the average achievement gap on state test scores for black students is 14.5 percentage points in English and 15.2 percentage points in math.” Further, the resolution states that “there are only ten public schools in California with majority African American student enrollment that perform in the top half of statewide performance in ELA and math and eight of those schools are charter public schools…”</p>, <p>The resolution calls for the NAACP to recognize the importance of quality public education and the importance of parent choice.</p>, <p>Boom! That is a slap in the face of the status quo, and by implication, the teachers' unions who so adamantly oppose reforms of any kind and especially those instituted in successful charter schools. That is a slap in the face of Joe Biden.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>It is not easy to oppose the wealthy and powerful teachers unions. Just ask former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who successfully broke their stranglehold in his state at a great political cost. But it could help distinguish Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. (once a charter advocate) or John Hickenlooper or another candidate from the crowd. And, it’s the right thing to do.</p>, <p>As Trump might say, “What do they have to lose?”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/liz-peek"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>I realize this call to prayer is received in various ways; however, praying for one’s leaders is not a blue or red decision; it is an opportunity for Christians to come together. We participate in electing a President and other government officials and can have disagreements on policies, but praying for our country and our leaders is our responsibility whether or not our candidate wins. When I disagree with policies or decisions, I am unfortunately too quick to complain and I seek to argue my perspective. Perhaps if I turned to prayer as a first response instead of a last resort, I would see that the “prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.” (James 5)</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/trump-prayer-franklin-graham-media-attacks"" target=""_blank"">FRANKLIN GRAHAM, 250 CHRISTIAN LEADERS CALL FOR 'DAY OF PRAYER' FOR TRUMP</a></strong></p>, <p>As you process through Franklin Graham’s request to pray for our President, consider the following:</p>, <p>First, there is power in prayer. The Billy Graham Evangelist Association explains prayer as a “spiritual communication between man and God, a two-way relationship in which man should not only talk to God but also listen to Him. Prayer to God is like a child’s conversation with his father. It is natural for a child to ask his father for the things he needs.” When God’s people pray, they are conversing with the God of the universe, and Scripture speaks to the importance of prayer within the life of the individual. AND, prayer is also where we can listen to God’s voice. Prayer speaks to God’s heart, but it also speaks to our hearts. Specifically, Philippians 4 instructs us to, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” Prayer is not only a way to present our requests to God, it provides a posture for his followers to be formed and comforted by our heavenly Father.</p>, <p>Second, calling for special times of prayer is a common occurrence throughout the Scriptures. Prayer is a regular part of the lives of God’s people, and prayer is also part of some of the most important events throughout the Bible. Abraham prays for an heir in Genesis 15. Samuel’s mother Hannah prays for her son in 1 Samuel 2.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>There is a special time of prayer at the dedication of Solomon’s temple in 1 Kings 8. Daniel prays regularly and is used by God to influence world leaders. Nehemiah prayed for his nation before receiving permission to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. In the New Testament, Jesus taught his disciples to pray (Matthew 6), and he had a dedicated time of prayer with his disciples prior to his arrest and crucifixion. Prayer is woven throughout the fabric of the Bible, and is an important element within the life of God’s people.</p>, <p>Third, we are commanded in Scripture to pray for our leaders. First, Timothy 2:1-2 indicates we are to pray for all people, but also specifically notes national leaders. The text reads, “I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and all those in authority, that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.” Scripture affirms the power of God to direct governing authorities and structures. From the humble beginnings of the nation of Israel to the establishment of kings over the nation of Israel, even to the future reign of Jesus over all creation, we see God’s sovereign hand at work. As his people, we are to faithfully serve him and regularly pray for those in authority over us.</p>, <p>Considering the power of prayer, the special times of prayer within Scripture, and the command for us to pray for our leaders, I hope you will make a special attempt to pray for our President this Sunday, it is both a privilege and responsible we bear as citizens of this nation and children of the King.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>The real aim may have been two-fold. As a 12-year FBI Director, Mueller must have had indigestion when he uncovered gross FBI malfeasance at the top, starting with his friend James Comey. The impulse to look the other way must have been strong.  </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/media-flooded-with-impeachment-stories-despite-tepid-backing-on-capitol-hill"">MEDIA FLOODED WITH IMPEACHMENT STORIES, DESPITE TEPID BACKING ON CAPITOL HILL</a></strong></p>, <p>Second, when Mueller realized no collusion existed – or sufficient evidence to charge obstruction – a sense of purposelessness must have weighed down his team.</p>, <p>Perhaps, that is when another idea surfaced. If they had to report findings, they could use the report to vindicate the FBI, more from institutional than personal loyalty. Forced to justify a $30 million-dollar inquiry, they could also set the congressional spike, especially after Democrats won control of the House. They arranged the testimony from 500 witnesses, 3,500 subpoenas and warrants, and a million freely-produced administration documents – to tell a story.</p>, <p>The story was long and selective, leaving just enough to the public imagination to create what they thought would be an inevitable conclusion – all breadcrumbs led to dinner, all roads to Rome, all insinuations, ambiguities and prevarications to impeachment.</p>, <p>Only something strange happened on the way to the table, coliseum and impeachment. Neither the attorney general nor deputy thought Mueller’s findings warranted further discussion. The report, redacted to protect grand jury material, effectively cleared the president. In a world where innocence prevails until guilt is proven, the story was over. </p>, <p>This was not the end Mueller thought he had written. He could have done that in 10 pages. Instead, he rolled out a 448-page report with unstated assumptions, unverified inferences, uninvestigated counter-inferences, and what he thought was the case for impeachment.</p>, <p>When the attorney general, majority of the legal community and public concluded otherwise, Mueller could not stay silent. He did something unorthodox. He wrote a letter to the attorney general re-arguing his case and boldly leaked it to the media.</p>, <p>When that tactic failed and House Democrats demanded the un-redacted report with protected grand jury material, Mueller could have issued a one-liner defending the attorney general and 200 years of American jurisprudence. He did not.</p>, <p>Then Wednesday, sensing his report’s impeachment message was getting lost, the narrative getting cold, Mueller conducted a press conference backhandedly suggesting impeachment, despite the report’s empirical failure to support that call. He took no questions – and perfunctorily left.</p>, <p>Not so fast … In the context of post-report showboating, Mueller should be asked some hard questions, like:</p>, <p>Other questions burn: If you knew the former FBI Director, Deputy Director, and other senior FBI personnel were compromised by poor judgement, illegal leaks, prejudice and passing sensitive information to cut-outs – if not worse – why did you not investigate them?  Why did you write a report which appears to consciously overlook, forgive or remain silent on these misdeeds?</p>, <p>Why, if you knew the predicate for FISA warrants was tainted, and these formed the basis for your own investigation, did you not end the inquiry – right there?  Why did you not investigate the false basis for those FISA warrant applications?  Why did you not address a miscarriage of justice at the highest levels?</p>, <p>And if you knew a presidential campaign had been illegally surveilled, using a foreign government to backchannel information, why did you not investigate that? Why did you not investigate intelligence reports behind the unmasking of some 300 innocent Americans by the Obama White House?</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>In short, Mueller, how is it that your report omits inquiry into origins of collusion allegations you were commissioned to investigate?  And how do you explain your recent behavior – which appears aimed at clearing the FBI and intentionally encouraging impeachment? </p>, <p>Perhaps time before the Senate Judiciary Committee would help America understand why certain questions got answered, others left unanswered, especially since the House has decided not to hear from Mueller.

He doesn't live anywhere near the State of Georgia. He made nearly $66 million last year. Therefore, he believes he can control what happens in the State of Georgia.</p>, <p>""Well, I think if it becomes law, it'll be very difficult to produce there,"" he said of the heartbeat bill recently. ""I rather doubt we will. I think many people who work for us will not want to work there and we'll have to heed their wishes in that regard.""</p>, <p>""Right now, we're watching it very carefully,"" Iger continued. ""I guess there's some speculation it could be enacted sometime after the first of the year. I think it's also likely to be challenged in the courts and that could delay it. And we're being -- we're being careful and cautious about it. But if it becomes law, I don't see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there.""</p>, <p>Got that? The company that brought you Minnie Mouse and Goofy and the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now demands that you approve of abortion, or they'll punish you.</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>Netflix is on board with this. That company currently films a number of shows in Georgia. If the state doesn't repeal its abortion law, Netflix says it will pull out.</p>, <p>This is all a remarkable change in American life in a very short period of time. It wasn't that long ago that it was citizens who boycotted companies they disagreed with. Now, it's corporations who boycott citizens.</p>, <p>What happened? It's not hard to figure out what happened. For generations, consumers and voters held the real power in this country, but not anymore. Now corporations are in charge, and they're happy to boss you around on behalf of the activist left. They'll lie about it, of course, and tell you it's all a matter of conscience. Right. As if they had consciences.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Netflix, for example, filmed its show ""Marco Polo"" in Malaysia. In case you haven't visited Malaysia recently, being gay is a crime there. Most of that country lives under Sharia law. Of course, abortion is also restricted in Malaysia, just as it is in Colombia, where Netflix filmed its show ""Narcos."" But the company didn't seem bothered by that.</p>, <p>Disney, by the way, just filmed its upcoming live-action ""Mulan"" film in China, which is safe to say in a police state, where huge parts of the internet are banned, and people are executed for having the wrong opinions. And in some cases, abortion is mandatory.</p>, <p>So, no, Disney and Netflix aren't really worried about anyone's rights, no matter what their flacks claim. Their real concern -- their only concern -- is power. Women with children might be tempted to put the needs of their own families before those who are shareholders. Abortion solves that problem.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The tyranny of ""woke"" capital is real, and it is terrifying. Just because they're selling you products, doesn't mean it's not a dictatorship. </p>, <p>Family shrinks or disappears entirely. Women are free to devote their lives to the company -- reliable little worker bees. Corporations get to expand their labor pool, lower wages and increase profits, all while delivering pious lectures about how they're giving women opportunities. ""We're feminists now!"" It's a grotesque scam. But it's remarkably effective.</p>, <p>Somewhere in the late 1990s, corporate America realized this. They learned that if they did the bidding of the left on social issues, they would get a pass on everything else. They could freeze wages. They could destroy the environment. They could strangle free speech. They can eliminate privacy. In general, they could make public life much worse.</p>, <p>All the while, they could get richer than any class of people in human history, and nobody would say anything. So that's exactly what they did, and they're still doing it.</p>, <p>Salesforce is a major tech company that sells software mostly to businesses. On Thursday, Salesforce announced that it won't work with customers who sell semi-automatic firearms or magazines that hold what gun control groups say are too many rounds.</p>, <p>Last year, Citigroup announced it would not allow stores that sell semi-automatic weapons to use their credit card services. That's where we are today. But it's not hard to match what it might be like tomorrow.</p>, <p>What if, for example, America -- corporate America -- decided to punish gun owners in addition to gun sellers? You've got a firearm at home, so you could no longer buy car insurance. Okay, you can't use Facebook. You can't open a checking account. You can't have a credit card. You can't stay in hotels.</p>, <p>Well, libertarians will tell you that's just fine - just the free market at work. If you don't like it, open your own credit card company. But you'd have to be a moron to believe them. In fact, that would be the end of the Second Amendment. The words would remain in the Bill of Rights, but they would be entirely symbolic. Big companies would have rendered them meaningless.</p>, <p>It's not a right if you can't exercise it. And that's where we're heading. It's not far off. Conservatives have been trained to see government as the only real threat to human freedom. And for much of the last hundred years that may have been true. It's not true anymore.</p>, <p>The tyranny of ""woke"" capital is real, and it is terrifying.

Well, a couple of these points are true but it paints a misleading image of what’s really happening on the world’s highest mountain.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">This spring 11 people lost their lives while climbing <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/mount-everest"" target=""_blank"">Everest</a>. Their families are grieving instead of joining the celebrations of the 700 other climbers who summited safely.</p>, <p>I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, elevation 338-feet above sea level. I camped out as an Eagle and Boy Scout and fell in love with mountains on a family vacation to <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado"" target=""_blank"">Colorado</a>. As an adult, I moved to Colorado and later to Switzerland for my job and climbed some of the most famous peaks in the Alps. But I never dreamed that I would summit Everest, much less her tougher little sister, K2.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/everest-climbing-record-rules-change-deaths"" target=""_blank"">CALIFORNIA WOMAN WHO BROKE EVEREST CLIMBING RECORD SAW FOUR BODIES DURING EXPEDITION, SAYS RULES MUST CHANGE TO STOP DEATHS</a></strong></p>, <p>I attempted Everest three times before accomplishing my goal on the fourth try at age 54 in 2011. Sitting on the summit, covered in goose down-filled clothes and staring at my heavy yellow boots, I quietly pulled the hood over my head and let my tears freely run down my frozen face.</p>, <p>Yes, as a climber, I was humbled and grateful but my emotions were driven more from my mom, Ida’s death a few years earlier from Alzheimer’s Disease. You see, often climbing mountains is not about the climb but the reason behind the climb.</p>, <p>I was sucker-punched this year when I saw the picture taken by Nirmal Purja Magar of the long line of climbers at the Hillary Step. They were almost to the summit on the more popular Nepal side of the mountain. The evidence in this image showed what is so wrong on Everest these days. It told me that in addition to the explainable reason that the weather limited the acceptable days from the usual dozen to only a few, but it also told me that there were too many people on Everest that had not earned the privilege, they had simply bought a ticket, to attempt to climb the highest mountain on our planet.</p>, <p>Many people who have seen the image, use it as Exhibit A in the trial that Everest, and perhaps mountaineering as a sport, is broken. The media coverage of the 11 deaths on Everest dwarfed the coverage of the deaths of some of the best climbers in the world earlier this year.</p>, <p>Tom Ballard was the son of Alison Hargreaves who was the first woman to summit Everest without supplemental oxygen. He and his partner Daniel Nardi both died in February on the 8,000-meter peak Nanga Pabart. Then in April, elite climbers, American Jess Roskelley and Austrians David Lama and Hansjörg Auer were killed in an avalanche on Canada’s Howse Peak attempting a very difficult new route. The coverage lasted a day, this year’s Everest coverage is still in full bloom.</p>, <p>I get it. The elite climbers understand the bargain with the mountain. They attempt the almost impossible, reap the rewards through sponsors and more, climbing while the 11 who died on Everest were just regular people following a dream, no matter how unprepared.</p>, <p>Ten years ago, you had to spend $45,000 or even $65,000 to get on an Everest team. Today, you can buy your way on to a team for well under $30,000. Natural market dynamics have created competition. But not all guides are the same, just like flying is not the same on all airlines … but the personal risks are drastically different.</p>, <p>There are no significant requirements to join an Everest team. Just pay your $11,000 permit fee to the Nepal government, find a team and get to Kathmandu in early April. Many guides only ask about the money, not the experience. They tell their customers that they will teach them everything they need to know. No experience needed. The best guides vet their clients and don’t accept anyone who lacks basic and proven mountaineering experience. There is a difference.</p>, <p>I was once told by a low-cost operator that I didn’t need to train for Annapurna, the world’s most-deadly 8,000-meter mountain. Just come over.</p>, <p>On May 23rd, each person standing in line just below Everest’s summit was using up their limited supply of life-giving bottled oxygen. They must have looked at the person ahead and behind and wondered. But where was the leadership? The famed “Sherpa Guides” -- as the Nepal Tourism department anointed everyone with the last name of Sherpa -- who worked on Everest. This was to address the negative publicity that there were not enough guides. It was similar to saying everyone on an airplane was a pilot. Nepal excels in tourism public relations.</p>, <p>The Sherpas and Western Guides who were there saved multiple lives. They saw the long lines. They knew someone had to take control. The most experienced guides directed traffic. The strongest Sherpas, literally dragged the fallen down the mountain. Many Sherpas gave up their own personal supply of oxygen to their clients, again saving lives. The best Sherpas showed why many of them are the best Everest climbers. And many of the weakest customers proved that they should have been turned back hours earlier by their mountain guardians.</p>, <p>What lessons have been learned from this year? Sadly, the same ones offered in 1996, 2006 and 2012: inexperience kills, not all guides are the same, money buys access, the weather has the last word. And Nepal is in continuous denial about the problems, blinded by the tens of millions brought in each spring, deaths be damned.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Mountaineering is a very personal sport.

</p>, <p>Far from it. The same poll revealed that a majority of Americans, 62 percent, continue to endorse the free market rather than government when it comes to decisions affecting the economy. A majority also favor free enterprise rather than government control over health care and higher education.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jason-nichols-dont-believe-gop-hysteria-about-dems-turning-us-into-a-socialist-nightmare""><strong>JASON NICHOLS: DON'T BELIEVE GOP HYSTERIA ABOUT DEMS TURNING US INTO A SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE</strong></a></p>, <p>These seemingly contradictory results, Gallup said, reveal that Americans are divided on how to describe the current state of the U.S. economy and determine its future direction. I believe they are divided for the following reasons:</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The truth is that planning leads inevitably to tyranny while free enterprise leads to the American Dream.</p>, <p>This trifecta has been working to turn America into a socialist state since Franklin D. Roosevelt said in a 1932 campaign address: “The first obligation of government is the protection of the welfare and well-being, indeed the very existence of its citizens.” No president had ever before promised such a sweeping responsibility of the federal government.</p>, <p>At the same time, John Dewey and his colleagues at Columbia University were turning out educators committed to “democratic socialism,” an effort reinforced by the same 1960s radicals who are tenured university professors today. And all along a media elite evolved that endorsed a central place for government.</p>, <p>However, all is not lost. There is a powerful counter-establishment committed to the preservation and protection of our free market system and the checks and balances of the Constitution. Groups including the National Rifle Association, the Right to Work Committee and the Right to Life Committee exist to counter our politicians. To counter the academy, we have groups like the Heritage Foundation and 65 state think tanks from Maine to California. To counter the media elite, we have Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, the Wall Street Journal and a burgeoning presence on social media.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>The freedom movement has one more priceless asset — the truth. Socialism has been tried in some 40 countries over the past century, and it has failed every time and everywhere. The United Kingdom, India, Denmark and Israel all tried socialism, and after decades of misery, rejected it.</p>, <p>The truth is that planning leads inevitably to tyranny while free enterprise leads to the American Dream.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/e/lee-edwards""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LEE EDWARDS</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Can America afford the 2020 presidential hopeful's ambitious plan? King's College business and economics professor Brian Brenberg weighs in.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Before she was upended Friday morning by questions about her false claims to minority status, Democratic presidential hopeful <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren"">Sen. Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts was enjoying another positive week in her presidential campaign.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">After a sluggish start, Warren’s political fortunes have been <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-support-drops-as-harris-warren-edge-up-in-new-national-poll"">on the rise</a> of late. </p>, <p>A May 21<a href=""https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2622"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline""> poll</a> from Quinnipiac University<em> </em>showed Warren in third place in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination at 13 percent – up from 4 percent in March. </p>, <p>Warren was close behind Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who was in second place in the poll at 16 percent. But she trailed far behind early frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden, who was favored by 35 of Democrats and voters leaning Democratic.</p>, <p>As Warren’s viability in a 23-candidate field has increased amid a barrage of positive news coverage, so too has renewed scrutiny around her past. That’s a surefire sign of any candidate with momentum. </p>, <p>Now – believe it or not – it’s Warren’s liberal credentials that are under fire. </p>, <p>Among the skeletons in Warren’s closet, voters are most familiar with swirling questions about her claim to Native American heritage. Driven ruthlessly by President Trump and compounded by her own clumsy handling of a DNA test, the information flow around Warren has centered on this scandal for years. </p>, <p>The matter had ebbed of late – until Friday.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Thus far, the political attacks on Warren’s ancestry claims have come from her opponents on the right. Her fellow Democrats have steered clear of the issue, which has robbed it of reaching its full potency.</p>, <p>During a <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/05/fauxcahontas-struggles.php"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">tense </a>interview on</u> the syndicated radio show “The Breakfast Club” – which has emerged this year as a “must-stop spot” for Democratic candidates – Warren once again failed to emerge unscathed from basic questions about her ancestry.</p>, <p>After falling back on her well-worn and unpersuasive talking points, Warren was compared by an interviewer who calls himself ""Charlamagne tha God"" to the “original Rachel Dolezal,” a white woman who claimed to be African-American.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://splinternews.com/elizabeth-warren-is-still-disastrously-unprepared-to-ta-1835152518"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">Splinter News</a></u><em> </em>declared Warren “disastrously unprepared” to address the controversy. </p>, <p>Thus far, the political attacks on Warren’s ancestry claims have come from her opponents on the right. Her fellow Democrats have steered clear of the issue, which has robbed it of reaching its full potency. </p>, <p>At its core, the entire question is whether Warren’s claims to minority status when applying to Ivy League institutions for jobs could have denied a more deserving applicant a position. </p>, <p>Warren has steadfastly denied that allegation, but should one of her primary opponents decide it’s time to press the case, she will have a fresh round of questions to answer. No longer will she be able to wave it aside as an attack from her right-wing detractors</p>, <p>Warren’s ancestry isn’t the only matter under the microscope. Late last week, The Washington Post uncovered more than 50 legal cases Warren was involved in during her time as a corporate attorney. It was also revealed that Warren was billing up to $675 per hour for her work. </p>, <p>In 2012 – Warren’s first and only other competitive political campaign until now – the longtime law professor was far from forthcoming about her past legal work. Back then, she reluctantly disclosed 13 cases – four times less than the number the Post reported – and only under immense political pressure.</p>, <p>Why do the details of Warren’s decades-old work as a highly compensated corporate attorney matter now? After all, this is America and there’s nothing wrong with making money. But that’s not true when you’re running for the nomination of a party hijacked by socialism. </p>, <p>Warren’s skittishness in addressing her legal work is a tell. She knows that representing corporations in their legal battles undercuts her core campaign message as a middle-class warrior standing up for the little guy. </p>, <p>Sure, Warren claims that she was <em>really </em>on the side of the victims during complex bankruptcy negotiations, but it doesn’t require an Ivy League degree to understand that companies tend not to hire lawyers to help them pay out more generous settlements.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Once again, Warren’s corporate work is a political hit best delivered from the left. With large Democratic field and the first presidential debates coming in June, there will be ample opportunity for one of her opponents to draw further blood. </p>, <p>As Warren’s surges upward in the polls, her opponents have an incentive to attack her. The fireworks over the next few weeks should be fun to watch. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/colin-reed"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COLIN REED</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Adam Lanza, who killed almost two dozen children in a Connecticut school in 2012, struggled with developmental disorders and was on psychiatric medication, which he had stopped taking. Jiverly Wong was suspected of suffering from paranoia before he walked into the American Civics Association in New York in 2009 and murdered 13 people.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The most recent mass killing in Florida last month has reignited the debate over the extent to which mental illness plays a role in such violence, and even about what is meant by mental illness. The horror at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High also is shining a light on the contradictory views among prominent criminology and mental health experts about mental illness as a risk factor in mass shootings.</p>, <p class=""entry-meta"" style=""margin: 0; padding: 0;font-size:14px;color:#183a52"">

</p>, <p>In a study of 185 public mass shootings– defined as an incident in which four or more people are killed at a public location – from 1900 through 2017 criminologist Grant Duwe found that 59 percent were committed by people who had been diagnosed as mentally ill or showed signs of having a serious mental disorder before the attack.</p>, <p>“Typically what we see with those who carry out a mass public shooting is that they do suffer from a mental disorder, in some cases it’s diagnosable, or there’s some information from friends and family that indicates they suffered from mental illness,” said Duwe, who is the research director for the Minnesota Department of Corrections and author of “Mass Murder in the United States: A History.”</p>, <p>
      James Holmes convicted of the murder of 12 people and the attempted murder of 70 others in the 2012 Aurora shooting at a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado.
      <span class=""copyright"">(AP/Denver Post)</span></p>, <p>“Paranoid schizophrenia is what is more common among these individuals,” Duwe told Fox News. “They feel like large groups of people are out to get them, and that they are responsible for making their life miserable. We also see that individuals who do this are loners, they’re not trusting, so they don’t have close friendships of social relationships.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/"" target=""_blank"">Mother Jones, the left-leaning publication, compiled a database of mass shootings</a> going back to 1982, and found that about half involved some form of “mental health issue.” They included people who had been diagnosed with serious conditions, but also those who had domestic violence and work conflict histories.</p>, <p>An analysis by <a href=""https://everytownresearch.org/documents/2017/03/appendix-mass-shootings-united-states-2009-2016.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Everytown for Gun Safety</a> released last year showed that in mass killings between January 2009 and December 2016, the shooter displayed at least one red flag, or troubling behavior, in 42 percent of cases.</p>, <p>At the same time, many studies on mass shootings and mental illness show a smaller link.</p>, <p>
      Dylan Roof killed nine people at a Charleston, South Carolina church on June 17, 2015
      <span class=""copyright"">(AP)</span></p>, <p>Many widely cited studies, including some conducted by the National Institutes of Health, on gun violence show that anywhere between 4 and 20 percent of the incidents are caused by people with a serious mental illness.</p>, <p>Jeffrey Swanson, a professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University who specializes in gun violence and mental illness, conducted a study funded in part by the National Institutes of Health that found that 4 percent of gun and other violence is traceable to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression – the three mental health conditions most frequently found in violent incidents.</p>, <p>Swanson says the role of mental illness is overplayed after a shooting that grips at the country.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">A mass shooting is so disturbing, so irrational, and horrifying, people want to know why is happened, and mental illness is the perfect master explanation.</p>, <p>“A mass shooting is so disturbing, so irrational, and horrifying, people want to know why it happened, and mental illness is the perfect master explanation,” said Swanson to Fox News.</p>, <p>What is more common among perpetrators of mass shootings, Swanson said, are potentially red flag behaviors such as festering anger, alienation, and bitterness over being bullied, perhaps, that do not meet the threshold of a mental disorder -- and that may not be perceptible even to those close to the person -- but that can lead to violence. Substance abuse is a common thread in mass shootings, found to be a factor in nearly 40 percent of shooters.</p>, <p>“If we were to cure mental illness, all of it, tomorrow, how much of our violence problem would go down? It would go down about 4 percent,” said Swanson, who has studied the issue for the National Institutes of Health. “The mass shooters, with some exception, have been angry, alienated, emotionally troubled young men who act out these incredibly deviant cultural scripts and have access to firearms.”</p>, <p>
      Stephen Paddock opened fire at a Las Vegas music festival, killing 58 people.
      <span class=""copyright"">(AP)</span></p>, <p>“There are tons of people who are risky, who are angry or suicidal, but who would pass a background check,” Swanson said. “They don’t have a felony conviction, they’ve never been involuntarily committed. How do you make sure dangerous people don’t get access to firearms?”</p>, <p>Duwe argues that the role of mental illness in mass shootings is underplayed.</p>, <p>“Part of the blowback with connecting mental illness to mass shootings is the fear that mentally ill people will be stigmatized,” Duwe said, adding that the concern is a valid one. “That’s what we try to be careful with, most of the people with serious mental illness are not violent.”</p>, <p>“But we should not ignore the connection between mental illness and mass shootings that is very real,” said Duwe, who recently co-authored an <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-duwe-rocque-mass-shootings-mental-illness-20180223-story.html"" target=""_blank"">op-ed on the issue in The Los Angeles Times.</a> “The issue has become very politicized, like tribal warfare.”</p>, <p>A major obstacle to a better system for predicting who might commit a mass shooting, experts say, is that it is relatively rare, and more funding is needed to study it more in-depth.</p>, <p>Many studies differ in their definition of mental illness, with some looking at diagnosable conditions, others only at serious ones such as paranoid schizophrenia, and still others taking a broad approach, including more common things such as attention deficit disorder and anxiety.</p>, <p>“It’s an elastic boundary, a rubber ruler,” Swanson said. “About 48 million people in the U.S. have some kind of diagnosable mental illness.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">We should not ignore the connection between mental illness and mass shootings that is very real. The issue has become very politicized, like tribal warfare.</p>, <p>What is more, not all studies or news reports look at the same categories of violence when addressing the role of mental illness, Duwe and Swanson noted.</p>, <p>Some look at all violence, others look at mass killings (which may or may not involve guns), and still others look at mass shootings that don’t occur in a public place or that targets strangers – such as when a disgruntled fired employee commits workplace violence or someone kills four or more people in a household or when a criminal kills several people in the course of say a robbery.</p>, <p>“There has not been systematic assessment of mass shooters” that would meet scientific criteria, Swanson said. “We often are operating on the basis of sketchy information” about a perpetrators'odd behavior.</p>, <p>Gun rights advocates say the answer is not curbing Second Amendment rights, but acting more responsibly when behavioral “red flags” are observed, as they were in the case of Cruz in Florida. They argue that the massacre likely would never have happened if law enforcement officials had simply done their job and investigated numerous leads suggesting Cruz had mental illness issues.</p>, <p>One approach gaining momentum is <a href=""https://everytownresearch.org/red-flag-laws-helping-prevent-mass-shooting/"" target=""_blank"">Red Flag Laws</a>, which allow relatives and officials to seek a court order to remove guns from dangerous people. Five states have the laws, and Red Flag measures are pending in roughly 20 others.</p>, <p>In a written statement, the FBI said a person close to Cruz contacted the agency's tip line Jan. 5 to report concerns about ""Cruz’s gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.""</p>, <p>Florida does not have a Red Flag Law.</p>, <p>""Under established protocols, the information provided by the caller should have been assessed as a potential threat to life,"" the FBI said.</p>, <p>In a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, the leader of the National Rifle Association Wayne LaPierre said that opponents of gun rights want to ""sweep under the carpet"" the failure of school safety, families ""and even the unbelievable failure of the FBI"" to prevent the shootings. LaPierre made the case that there is room for the gun lobby and gun control advocates to find common ground.</p>, <p>Efforts by Fox News to get a comment from the NRA were unsuccessful.</p>, <p>Bonnie Zampino, a behavioral health professional who trains educators, among others, on how to manage people with mental illness and behavioral issues, said it’s important that school officials, counselors, families and law enforcement work together and establish communication lines when a young person begins exhibiting so-called red flag that might lead to violence.</p>, <p>Often, she said, efforts to address such behaviors are disjointed or have no follow-up.</p>, <p>“This young man was exhibiting behaviors that would indicate that he had been exposed to trauma in life, he received medical care, he was evaluated, they didn’t find the need for further care,” said Zampino of Cruz, based on published information.</p>, <p>“It’s our job to be the professional who can look at the behavior, meet the need, stop the aggression,” said Zampino, who has an autistic child. “But [too often] we’re not paying enough attention, we’re not talking to one another.”</p>, <p>“Here we help teachers understand when they see a child coming into their classroom that clearly shows an issue and they’re being aggressive, how to get ahead of that behavior and deal with the trauma and how not to trigger the aggression,” she said. “We teach teachers proactive approaches.""</p>, <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

But Trump has kept that feud going even since McCain’s death, particularly his anger at McCain casting the decisive vote against Republican efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare in 2017.</p>, <p>In March Trump <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tears-into-mccains-legacy-support-for-iraq-war-during-speech-to-ohio-plant-workers"" target=""_blank"">complained at a rally</a> that he ""endorsed him at his request, gave him the kind of funeral he wanted...but I didn’t get a thank you.”</p>, <p>“I never liked him much,” Trump said. “I really probably never will.”</p>, <p>The warship was commissioned in 1994 and originally named for the senator's father and grandfather, both Navy admirals named John Sidney McCain. Last year, the Navy rededicated the ship to honor Sen. McCain.</p>, <p>According to the Journal, sailors on the ship were given the day off and a barge was moved closer to the ship, obscuring its name. But a spokesman told the Journal that the tarp was taken down and the barge removed before the presidential visit.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-says-not-involved-with-keeping-mccain-ship-out-of-view"" target=""_blank"">TRUMP SAYS NOT INVOLVED WITH KEEPING MCCAIN SHIP OUT OF VIEW</a></strong></p>, <p>Both Trump and Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan have denied knowing anything about any such orders. Trump told reporters Thursday that while he was not “a big fan” of McCain, “I would never do a thing like that.”</p>, <p>""Now, somebody did it because they thought I didn't like him, OK?

      Little is possibly the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history, surpassing the likes of John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy and Green River's Gary Ridgway. He has confessed to 93 murders between 1970 and 2005.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office)</span></p>, <p>Little was serving a life sentence in a California State Prison after he was convicted in 2013 for three murders. Several years later, in 2018, he was extradited to Texas for a fourth murder which he pleaded guilty to and received another life sentence.</p>, <p>While in a Texas State Prison, Little confessed to more killings, including five Ohio women. Investigators were able to track three of the five to the Cleveland area, and identified two of the women.</p>, <p>A third victim, a woman killed in Cincinnati in 1974, has yet to be identified.</p>, <p>
      Little drew portraits of his victims from memory. The woman on the left has not been identified by police but Little recalls that she was killed in Cincinnati, sometime in 1974. The woman on the right has since been identified as Mary Jo Peyton, 21, who was killed in 1984.  
      <span class=""copyright"">(FBI)</span></p>, <p>According to information Little provided to investigators, he met Peyton one night between May and June 1984 in a bar near E. 10th St. and Euclid Ave. The pair left the bar together and little took her to an abandoned factory where prosecutors say he killed her by strangling her with his hands. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/fbi-wants-help-in-identifying-victims-from-portraits-drawn-by-serial-killer"">FBI WANTS HELP IN IDENTIFYING VICTIMS FROM PORTRAITS DRAWN BY SERIAL KILLER</a></strong></p>, <p>He disposed of her body by throwing it down a basement stairwell.

He said he sees victims that have been trafficked through Toledo from across the country. </p>, <p>“They were on their way to Florida, Atlanta, Georgia. You know, Orlando, Tampa,” he said. “We know some victims end up there and some of our traffickers end up there.” </p>, <p>Swartz said he gets fulfillment from the work, even though he’s often dealing with minors who have been trafficked against their will. More importantly, he said the people coercing the teens into forced sex work are facing consequences. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>“I think we’ve made a significant difference as far as sex trafficking,” Swartz said. “A lot of the cases that we work with, the predators, the pimps, the traffickers are getting substantial sentences for turning out our kids.”</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on how both political parties are interpreting Special Counsel Robert Mueller's remarks during his public address.</p>, <p class=""speakable""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"">Mueller Time</a> came and went. Now it’s Impeachment Time, at least according to the “neutral” media.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Of course, now-former Special Counsel Robert Mueller never said <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump"">President Trump </a>should be impeached. But that didn’t stop journalists, who used every rhetorical trick in the book to push that narrative against the president.</p>, <p>Both MSNBC host Chris Hayes and CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger dissected Mueller’s Wednesday news conference about his report, relying on either “reading between the lines” or “If you read between the lines.” </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/media-flooded-with-impeachment-stories-despite-tepid-backing-on-capitol-hill""><strong>MEDIA FLOODED WITH IMPEACHMENT STORIES, DESPITE TEPID BACKING ON CAPITOL HILL</strong></a></p>, <p>It was reminiscent of the great movie “Network,” where the TV network entertainment division took over news and installed programs including “Sybil: The Soothsayer.” </p>, <p>The media didn’t stop there. ABC’s Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran did his own reading between the lines. “This is Robert Mueller saying to Congress do your job. It is time to take this up,” he said.</p>, <p>”CBS This Morning” co-host Tony Dokoupil also wanted the same kind of guesswork from reporter Major Garrett: “What words stood out to you? What messages were embedded in those remarks?” </p>, <p>NBC was thrilled by the idea of impeachment. “Today” host Savannah Guthrie followed suit, also interpreting what Mueller said. “He’s without using that word reminding folks that there is a process and it’s called impeachment,” she said.</p>, <p>Legal analyst Mimi Rocah couldn’t hide her hopes. “And I hope that now Congress picks up that mantle more and does it in a more effective way,” she said. “And I think that’s what Mueller was asking them to do.”</p>, <p>The mood was similar at sister network MSNBC where “Morning Joe” immediately shifted into attack mode. Branding expert Donny Deutsch wanted to shift the narrative away from impeachment, but not from the action. “It’s a losing word,” he told viewers. Instead, “you take the word impeachment, and you change it to ‘criminal activity.’” </p>, <p class=""quote-text"">What is especially humorous is that even The New York Times admitted that no one agreed what Mueller had said in his brief presentation.</p>, <p>Deutsch had grand visions of liberal success, all with a minor word change. “We are going to initiate and continue the ongoing Trump criminal investigations. Trump criminal, Trump criminal investigations,” he said.</p>, <p>The hour changed, but the script didn’t. MSNBC anchor Kasie Hunt kept talking the magic “I” word with her “Big Question.” </p>, <p>“What more do congressional Democrats need to hear before they make a decision about impeachment?” Hunt asked. She wanted New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to explain “why not begin impeachment proceedings?”</p>, <p>One of MSNBC’s resident RINOs (Republicans in name only), Elise Jordan, whined that Mueller wouldn’t testify and help undermine Trump. She compared his stance to a book author who said, ""Oh, I’m not going to go promote my book, just read the book and you'll learn what it’s all about.""</p>, <p>Contributor Malcolm Nance went even further, alleging Trump’s was utilizing a strategy of distraction that came “straight from the KGB playbook.” “There is a conspiracy out there,” he said, not seeming to care how silly that looked.</p>, <p>What is especially humorous is that even The New York Times admitted that no one agreed what Mueller had said in his brief presentation. The paper ran an analysis under this headline: “Mueller Delivered a Message. Washington Couldn’t Agree on What It Was.” That’s pretty much true of every major issue of the day.</p>, <p>The Times also published an opinion piece from Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky urging Mueller to get more political. “He is serving a vision of America that no longer exists,” Tomasky wrote, arguing that Mueller can’t serve the apolitical America by being … apolitical. </p>, <p><strong>Media Can’t Cover Abortion Objectively</strong></p>, <p>Few things motivate most journalists like backing “social justice” causes. One of their favorites is abortion. It doesn’t matter how extreme a liberal position is on abortion, journalists will back it.</p>, <p>With the passage of pro-life measures in several states, the media haven’t even pretended neutrality. The parent companies of NBC, ABC and CBS all threw in with the left on the debate and threatened to withdraw their tapings from Georgia because of a new pro-life law. </p>, <p>CNN flat-out denied reality in one abortion story, headlined “Pence discusses abortion with Trudeau, repeats Trump's 'infanticide' claim.” </p>, <p>According to CNN White House producer Kevin Liptak and reporter Caroline Kelly, Pence was “echoing false claims made last month by President Donald Trump about doctors killing babies that have already been born.”</p>, <p>If journalists were honest, they’d call this CNN story a lie. Because that’s what it is. Here, one more time, is the Jan. 30 quote from Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam: “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired.”</p>, <p>That’s precisely what Trump was addressing. But CNN has memory-holed it. Instead, anchor Jim Sciutto said new life-saving laws are “really turning back the clock, really to pre-1973, when that was the law of the land in a number of places.” </p>, <p>NPR brought on Dr. Colleen McNicholas, who performs abortions, and who referred to babies as “pregnancy tissue.” How many American women think their future babies are “pregnancy tissue?” </p>, <p>The CNN documentary series “United Shades of America” decided to emulate the rest of the press and ignore pro-life voices. Host and comedian W. Kamau Bell didn’t leave his pro-life interviews on the cutting-room floor, he just hid them in the online version of his documentary. </p>, <p>Hollywood joined the boycott calls. Director Ron Howard’s career has gone from playing Opie on the family-friendly “Andy Griffith Show” to telling Georgians he won’t film there because of pro-life laws won’t allow the butchery of more babies. That’s some character (or lack of character).</p>, <p><strong>Run Across the Border</strong></p>, <p>The immigration crisis is in the news again and that’s a perfect opportunity for the media to remind everyone they support open borders. Here’s just one excellent example.</p>, <p>CNN’s Christiane Amanpour showed her liberal stripes in an interview with Europe’s open border queen – German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Amanpour piled praise on Merkel’s “compassionate, courageous migration program, allowing a million or more people in.” Nice and neutral, that.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>The CNN International anchor went further, describing Merkel in the eyes of those who love her: “Analysts and historians today describe you as the face of good Germans, good Germany.” </p>, <p>It’s a key reminder that most journalists are globalists, which is why they attack nationalists so strongly. rump, of course, is a nationalist. </p>, <p>Hmmm.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/dan-gainor"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAN GAINOR</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

In his startling remarks, Mueller sought to justify himself by citing instruction from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The longstanding OLC opinion, an outgrowth of Nixon- and Clinton-era scandals, holds that a sitting president may not be indicted. The two press offices were struggling to reconcile (a) Mueller’s pointed reliance on this OLC guidance at the presser with (b) his prior disclaimers of such reliance.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>According to Attorney General William Barr, in a meeting over two weeks before Mueller submitted his final report, the special counsel emphatically denied that his refusal to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction hinged on the OLC guidance. Naturally, in their continuing quest to frame Barr as the most diabolical villain since Lex Luthor, the media-Democrat complex insisted that the AG must be lying.</p>, <p>This is what derangement will do to you. I do not think Mueller’s contradictory assertions are that hard to figure out. But if you were inclined to blame sleight of hand, the culprit would be Mueller. You’ll notice that when we finally heard from him on Wednesday, he lauded Barr’s good faith, never claiming that the AG had misrepresented him. Moreover, the conversation between them on the OLC guidance was not a one-on-one affair.

</p>, <p>I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, elevation 338-feet above sea level. I camped out as an Eagle and Boy Scout and fell in love with mountains on a family vacation to <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado"" target=""_blank"">Colorado</a>. As an adult, I moved to Colorado and later to Switzerland for my job and climbed some of the most famous peaks in the Alps. But I never dreamed that I would summit Everest, much less her tougher little sister, K2.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/everest-climbing-record-rules-change-deaths"" target=""_blank"">CALIFORNIA WOMAN WHO BROKE EVEREST CLIMBING RECORD SAW FOUR BODIES DURING EXPEDITION, SAYS RULES MUST CHANGE TO STOP DEATHS</a></strong></p>, <p>I attempted Everest three times before accomplishing my goal on the fourth try at age 54 in 2011. Sitting on the summit, covered in goose down-filled clothes and staring at my heavy yellow boots, I quietly pulled the hood over my head and let my tears freely run down my frozen face.</p>, <p>Yes, as a climber, I was humbled and grateful but my emotions were driven more from my mom, Ida’s death a few years earlier from Alzheimer’s Disease. You see, often climbing mountains is not about the climb but the reason behind the climb.</p>, <p>I was sucker-punched this year when I saw the picture taken by Nirmal Purja Magar of the long line of climbers at the Hillary Step. They were almost to the summit on the more popular Nepal side of the mountain. The evidence in this image showed what is so wrong on Everest these days. It told me that in addition to the explainable reason that the weather limited the acceptable days from the usual dozen to only a few, but it also told me that there were too many people on Everest that had not earned the privilege, they had simply bought a ticket, to attempt to climb the highest mountain on our planet.</p>, <p>Many people who have seen the image, use it as Exhibit A in the trial that Everest, and perhaps mountaineering as a sport, is broken. The media coverage of the 11 deaths on Everest dwarfed the coverage of the deaths of some of the best climbers in the world earlier this year.</p>, <p>Tom Ballard was the son of Alison Hargreaves who was the first woman to summit Everest without supplemental oxygen. He and his partner Daniel Nardi both died in February on the 8,000-meter peak Nanga Pabart. Then in April, elite climbers, American Jess Roskelley and Austrians David Lama and Hansjörg Auer were killed in an avalanche on Canada’s Howse Peak attempting a very difficult new route. The coverage lasted a day, this year’s Everest coverage is still in full bloom.</p>, <p>I get it. The elite climbers understand the bargain with the mountain. They attempt the almost impossible, reap the rewards through sponsors and more, climbing while the 11 who died on Everest were just regular people following a dream, no matter how unprepared.</p>, <p>Ten years ago, you had to spend $45,000 or even $65,000 to get on an Everest team. Today, you can buy your way on to a team for well under $30,000. Natural market dynamics have created competition. But not all guides are the same, just like flying is not the same on all airlines … but the personal risks are drastically different.</p>, <p>There are no significant requirements to join an Everest team. Just pay your $11,000 permit fee to the Nepal government, find a team and get to Kathmandu in early April. Many guides only ask about the money, not the experience. They tell their customers that they will teach them everything they need to know. No experience needed. The best guides vet their clients and don’t accept anyone who lacks basic and proven mountaineering experience. There is a difference.</p>, <p>I was once told by a low-cost operator that I didn’t need to train for Annapurna, the world’s most-deadly 8,000-meter mountain. Just come over.</p>, <p>On May 23rd, each person standing in line just below Everest’s summit was using up their limited supply of life-giving bottled oxygen. They must have looked at the person ahead and behind and wondered. But where was the leadership? The famed “Sherpa Guides” -- as the Nepal Tourism department anointed everyone with the last name of Sherpa -- who worked on Everest. This was to address the negative publicity that there were not enough guides. It was similar to saying everyone on an airplane was a pilot. Nepal excels in tourism public relations.</p>, <p>The Sherpas and Western Guides who were there saved multiple lives. They saw the long lines. They knew someone had to take control. The most experienced guides directed traffic. The strongest Sherpas, literally dragged the fallen down the mountain. Many Sherpas gave up their own personal supply of oxygen to their clients, again saving lives. The best Sherpas showed why many of them are the best Everest climbers. And many of the weakest customers proved that they should have been turned back hours earlier by their mountain guardians.</p>, <p>What lessons have been learned from this year? Sadly, the same ones offered in 1996, 2006 and 2012: inexperience kills, not all guides are the same, money buys access, the weather has the last word. And Nepal is in continuous denial about the problems, blinded by the tens of millions brought in each spring, deaths be damned.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Mountaineering is a very personal sport. The answer to the oft-asked question of “Why?” is unique and personal to each person.</p>, <p>To participate is to accept the bargain. Each climber accepts the risks and the rewards.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Not long ago, I took a birthday trip with a girlfriend and left my husband, Kevin, home with the kids, ages 1, 3, 5 and 7. As a former barista (and now <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/faith-values/faith"" target=""_blank"">family pastor)</a>, he excels at handling the crazy chaos of our home and caring for the kids. </p>, <p class=""speakable"">Still, I was a bit apprehensive about leaving for four days during a work week when the kids had <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education"" target=""_blank"">school. </a></p>, <p>I shouldn’t have been concerned, though. He totally crushed the whole single-dad thing. Every time I checked in via <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/facebook"" target=""_blank"">Facetime,</a> the kids were obviously thriving. He got the older kids off to school each morning, took them to swimming lessons, and even took all four to the grocery store (something I avoid doing at all costs). </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-most-powerful-thing-you-can-do-for-your-kids"" target=""_blank"">THE MOST POWERFUL THING YOU CAN DO FOR YOUR KIDS</a></strong></p>, <p>When I returned home, the house was clean and four excited children stood on the porch ready to greet me. </p>, <p>After many hugs and kisses were exchanged, Kevin said: “We make a good team.” “Oh yeah?” I asked, lifting the baby to my hip.</p>, <p>“Yeah,” he said. “I don’t think I could have held on for much longer without you.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Sometimes meeting all the demands of raising young kids can seem pretty impossible. But most challenges in life—at least the ones worth going after—are a process, not something we quickly attain.</p>, <p>His words surprised me. I was utterly impressed with how he’d managed everything while I was gone. From appearances, it seemed he’d actually surpassed my normal level of productivity, which admittedly slows to a snail’s pace on some days. </p>, <p>His affirmation that I was important to our family warmed my heart. </p>, <p>I am so aware of my shortcomings. My inability to complete projects that have been sitting undone for months. My lack of patience with my kids (especially on Sunday mornings). The never-ending battles with my kids over eating nutritious food, not just another bowl of cereal. I’m painfully conscious of all the areas where I could be doing better as a mom. </p>, <p>My husband’s words reminded me that the ways I’m daily investing in my children and being a grounding force in our home is vitally important. The loads of laundry washed, the simple instructions delivered over and over, the meals cooked, the hugs given—these small gestures add up to something big—something beautiful.  </p>, <p>Sometimes meeting all the demands of raising young kids can seem pretty impossible. But most challenges in life—at least the ones worth going after—are a process, not something we quickly attain. </p>, <p>When my role as a mom feels unimportant, I need to remember the goal: I am raising children to know God and become adults who make a difference in this world.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP </a> </strong></p>, <p>I was delighted that my husband noticed my contribution to our family, but there are many times where not a living soul notices all that I’m doing—the laundry, the scrubbing, the wiping, the snuggles, the dressing, the driving. </p>, <p>In those moments, I can be sure that my Father in heaven notices.

Dershowitz rightly pointed out that Mueller “went beyond the conclusion of his report and gave a political gift to Democrats in Congress who are seeking to institute impeachment proceedings against President Trump.” </p>, <p>Mueller’s report said there was no evidence President Trump broke the law. Mueller’s mouth said there was no proof<em> </em>Trump didn’t.</p>, <p>The problem is, Mueller’s verbal statement distorted the role of a prosecutor and flipped a core concept of the American justice system on its head – the idea that people are innocent until proven guilty. </p>, <p>Dating back to John Adams’s principled defense of British soldiers against an incensed public after the Boston Massacre, Americans have held that proving the burden of guilt falls on the state.</p>, <p>And the bottom line is: After a nearly two-year investigation consisting of 15 lawyers, many millions of taxpayer dollars, and interviews of more than 500 witnesses, everything in Mueller’s 448-page report leads to the conclusion that President Trump is not guilty of any crimes. </p>, <p>Like Independent Counsel Ken Starr, who declared in his report that there was “substantial and credible evidence” that President Bill Clinton was guilty of 11 separate counts of criminal activity (including obstruction of justice), Mueller could have concluded that President Trump obstructed justice without citing any formal charges. He declined to do so.</p>, <p>Sean Davis, writing in <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thefederalist.com_2019_05_29_mueller-2Djust-2Dproved-2Dhis-2Dentire-2Doperation-2Dwas-2Da-2Dpolitical-2Dhit-2Djob-2Dthat-2Dtrampled-2Dthe-2Drule-2Dof-2Dlaw_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=AA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7_DqJFkmec&amp;m=80oCImeyM28NEc_uiSaXyZ4P41dgRagytMIh9EGLmD4&amp;s=NR9oavwtj1fM77H9iepeOdnbDN76fs2lvUKhD5Cp7N4&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">The Federalist</a>, also pointed out that Mueller’s politicization of his investigation was self-refuting. Mueller had said that “it is important that the office’s written work speak for itself,” but then he kept talking.</p>, <p>As Davis wrote: “Mueller’s report was released to the public by Attorney General William Barr nearly six weeks ago. The entire report, minus limited redactions required by law, has been publicly available, pored through, and dissected. … If it’s important for the work to speak for itself, then why did Mueller schedule a press conference in which he would speak for it weeks after it was released?”</p>, <p>Mueller is making the political suggestion that President Trump should be impeached on allegations of obstruction of justice for which Mueller and his team of hot-shot lawyers found no proof. This is a clear example of a prosecutor who is trying to get an outcome regardless of evidence.

They have joined forces to support the world’s most oppressive and dangerous dictators from North Korea and Syria to Venezuela. Only America has the resources to stop them.</p>, <p>The danger we now face is that an America trapped in a perpetual political crisis, and a chief executive hobbled by a bitter impeachment battle, won’t have the will or strength to prevent this new Axis, like its pre-World War Two predecessor, from creating an authoritarian world order. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/media-flooded-with-impeachment-stories-despite-tepid-backing-on-capitol-hill"" target=""_blank"">MEDIA FLOODED WITH IMPEACHMENT STORIES, DESPITE TEPID BACKING ON CAPITOL HILL</a></strong></p>, <p>The danger we now face is that an America trapped in a perpetual political crisis, and a chief executive hobbled by a bitter impeachment battle, won’t have the will or strength to prevent this new Axis, like its pre-World War Two predecessor, from creating an authoritarian world order. </p>, <p>The shame is that Mueller could have used his statement on Wednesday to defuse that political crisis. He could have simply said, “Everything we have to say is contained in our report. We had to conclude there’s no evidence of collusion with Russia in the 2016 election; my team, which included top Hillary supporters and leading Trump haters, could find no probable cause to make the case President Trump obstructed justice, either. For our nation’s future, it’s time for all of us to move on, as I have.”</p>, <p>Unfortunately, that sort of nobility of spirit was beyond Bob Mueller. Instead, he took one last swipe at the president he despises, as he urged Congress to continue to look for crimes the facts say didn’t happen – and the law says can’t be proved.</p>, <p>Thanks to Mueller, impeachment by a Democrat-led Congress is almost certain; the defeat of impeachment in the Republican-dominated Senate is just as certain. This process will satisfy no one; it will leave us more divided than ever, with an ever-diminishing faith in our governing institutions to secure justice or to handle a national crisis.</p>, <p>On the world stage, however, this leaves America in a far worse state. </p>, <p>China, in particular, will see America’s weakness as their opportunity to checkmate Trump’s trade and foreign policy initiatives, which are aimed at stopping China’s drive to displace the United States as the world’s superpower. The men in Beijing understand that Trump is the first president in a generation to “get it” about China’s effort to create a new world order that depends on the Chinese economy, Chinese technologies, and China’s grand strategic vision outlined the Communist Party document “Made in China 2025” – in other words, a president who has to be stopped in his tracks.  </p>, <p>A weakened Donald Trump will play directly into Beijing’s plans. Even more insidiously, perpetual turmoil in Washington reinforces China’s propagandistic campaign to the world that it, not America, has found the secret to democracy in the 21st century. Beijing routinely touts the so-called China model, i.e. a top-down system where the communist party recruits and rewards an elite drawn from all classes of society while excluding and punishing those who resist the party line, the true “democracy” of the future. Chinese party leaders extol their version of democracy as embodying stability and predictability, compared to the uncertainty and chaos of American democracy – a contrast which we’re managing to confirm. </p>, <p>Now, some believe getting Donald Trump out of office is going to somehow restore faith in our political system, and clean the slate. Others –largely Trump supporters – think exposing the effort by high-level government officials, including in the FBI, to derail Trump’s candidacy and then his presidency, will do the same thing, and allow the president to finally govern in peace.</p>, <p>Both sides think if they win this nightmare will be over. Both are wrong.</p>, <p>Democrats and NeverTrumpers will never stop believing Trump’s election was a swindle and the triumph of bigotry and hate. Trump supporters will continue to believe that impeachment is a swindle, and the triumph of the other side’s lies and corruption.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Bob Mueller had his moment in the limelight to suggest this head-on collision isn’t the only option for America. He let it pass; he even did his level best to inflame the passions on both sides.</p>, <p>America, not Donald Trump or the NeverTrumpers, is going to be the big loser in what’s coming. And America’s enemies are looking like big winners.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/arthur-herman"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ARTHUR HERMAN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

But after the shock and grief wore off, we began the descent into our current state of <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics"" target=""_blank"">all-out partisan war</a>, and it’s even reached <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education"" target=""_blank"">high school</a>. My generation – Gen Z – must demand a cease-fire or we’ll be the first in our nation’s history that’s poorer and less secure than our predecessors.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Polls confirm that there’s a national consensus that our country faces severe long-term problems – a $22 trillion national debt, the growing gap between rich and poor, climate change, and decaying infrastructure. However, our entitled Baby Boomer leaders, who benefited from the prosperity created by the Greatest Generation’s sacrifice, refuse to work together. Instead, they selfishly demonize their opponents to try to win the next news cycle –  and hopefully the next election. No wonder the presidency has swung from George W. Bush to Barack Obama to Donald Trump, and our existential problems keep getting worse.</p>, <p>My generation has become the foot soldiers in the war between red and blue states – and we’re the most likely casualties. Even in high school, we now mimic what we see on Fox and MSNBC in treating each other. I recently posted on Instagram criticizing celebrities who tell their teenage fans to vote for “progressives” instead of urging us to be informed voters when we turn 18. Immediately, my friends texted me to take down my post. “Your reputation will get hurt,” they warned.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/abortion-chicago-student-bill-death-threats"" target=""_blank"">UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRO-LIFE STUDENT SAYS HE RECEIVED DEATH THREATS FOR ABORTION FUNDING BILL</a></strong></p>, <p>Growing up in a Republican family in the bluest of blue cities has pulled me in both directions. My family has taught me conservative values, but my high school promotes 21st-century progressivism. At school, I was pressured to exalt Barack and Hillary. At home, we longed for Reagan’s shining city on a hill.</p>, <p>Over the past two years, I’ve spent hundreds of hours trying to learn both sides of the issues. Now that I’m finally ready, my peers don’t want to debate me. They turn their backs and call me crazy. “Ugh, she’s a Republican.” In New York City, it’s only socially acceptable for a 17-year-old girl to be a super fan of RBG and Bernie. But in red states, teens love their MAGA hats.</p>, <p>Young and old all want a better future. But the only way to create a better America is by considering blue, red, and purple solutions and trying to see if there’s common ground. How can we hope for a better future when we refuse to listen to the other side on how to create it? How can we dream of a “free” world while bullying peers for what they believe?</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Young and old all want a better future. But the only way to create a better America is by considering blue, red, and purple solutions and trying to see if there’s common ground. </p>, <p>Over the past 75 years, Democrats and Republicans worked together to rebuild Europe after World War II, to fund our national highway system, to reduce discrimination, and to protect our environment. There’s broad support for Social Security and Medicare, but Obamacare, which passed on a party-line vote, remains on life support.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>My generation should not mirror our Baby Boomer elders. We must speak civilly with each other about politics. Teenage Trump supporter, stop calling your liberal friends, “snowflakes.” Do not endorse people who perpetuate hate. Buy a subscription to The New Republic. Bernie fans, Republicans are not all racists. Republicans provided the votes to pass our civil rights laws and to honor MLK with a national holiday. Government is not always the solution.</p>, <p>Gen Z can’t let hatred for President Trump, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Elizabeth Warren translate into contempt for our peers who align with the other side. Our Baby Boomer leaders need to realize that their partisan war is hurting my generation. We can all make America great if we learn how to be civil to each other.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters. The large number of FBI employees who were in contact with journalists during this time period impacted our ability to identify the sources of leaks.</em></p>, <p>But this week, we learned the OIG actually has identified one of the sources and suggested the allegations were supported by ""a preponderance of evidence."" Though that is certainly newsworthy, the real news was the Justice Department response. Officials mysteriously, though not surprisingly, declined to prosecute one of their own.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Creating new laws for theJustice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.</p>, <p>These are serious allegations against a very senior FBI official. How can the department not take action when there is direct evidence in hand? This is someone who deliberately and illegally disclosed sensitive information from sealed court filings. If the Justice Department looks the other way, what message does that send to the rest of the FBI? What better way to signal to the entire federal law enforcement apparatus that laws and rules are optional?</p>, <p>Unfortunately, we routinely have people at DOJ who put their thumb on the scale to impact politics. It's obviously part of the culture fostered by the two previous FBI directors, Robert Mueller and James Comey. They have both shown political animus and bias toward President Trump.</p>, <p>Comey himself released sealed information, likely for a political purposes. Mueller this week left no doubt of his own animus toward the president. No wonder the American people have lost faith in our federal law enforcement.</p>, <p>Not only is there no penalty for violating the law, there may actually be an incentive for doing so. For leakers with partisan motivations, the chance to impact an election may outweigh the risk of an unlikely prosecution.</p>, <p>If we want to instill confidence in the system, we need to be able to demonstrate that when somebody violates rules and laws within the FBI, they, too, will be prosecuted and held accountable.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>There is little Congress can do legislatively. Leaking is already against the law. Creating new laws for the Justice Department to ignore does not solve the problem. But Congress can be part of the solution through the oversight function.</p>, <p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., should call on the Justice Department to answer to the American people for this failure to prosecute. Members of the Judiciary Committee in the House and Senate should question Inspector General Michael Horowitz about his findings and demand answers from the DOJ about the failure to prosecute. There may be no better way to get the answers the American people deserve.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/jason-chaffetz""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JASON CHAFFETZ</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>The San Diego hospital where she was born said Saybie is believed to be the world’s smallest surviving newborn, according to the <a href=""https://webapps1.healthcare.uiowa.edu/TiniestBabies/index.aspx"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Tiniest Babies Registry</a> kept by the University of Iowa.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/san-diego-hospital-announces-birth-of-worlds-tiniest-surviving-baby"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">SAN DIEGO HOSPITAL ANNOUNCES BIRTH OF WORLD’S TINIEST SURVIVING BABY</a></strong></p>, <p>I and other pro-life Americans noted on <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/PYNance"" style=""color: blue;"">Twitter</a></u> and other platforms that Saybie is living proof that science is on the side of the pro-life cause. Her very survival must raise questions for our nation regarding current law on abortion.</p>, <p>The late Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun famously said regarding the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court that legalized abortion nationwide: ""If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.""</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Clearly, sweet Saybie was not just a clump of cells, nor was she ever “a part of the mother’s body.” Saybie was and is a distinct and precious human being with intrinsic value.</p>, <p>And of course, we are there now. Sonograms – 3-D, 4-D and HD – have settled the question of when life begins. At conception, a child has his or her own DNA separate and apart from the mother. We can see the baby’s beating heart as early as 18 days. At 30 days the developing little boy or girl has a nervous system. </p>, <p>At 12 weeks the child has fingernails. At 20 weeks, the baby has all the major organs we have, along with toenails and eyebrows. The child can sleep, can hear, can respond to the mother’s voice and can feel pain. </p>, <p>Clearly, sweet Saybie was not just a clump of cells, nor was she ever “a part of the mother’s body.” Saybie was and is a distinct and precious human being with intrinsic value. And now she has the opportunity to grow up and hopefully live a full life for many decades to come. </p>, <p>Reports say that doctors performed an emergency cesarean section because Saybie’s mother’s life was in danger; yet, precious Saybie and her mother survived. </p>, <p>Sadly, <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2Ietkz7"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">31</a></u> states currently allow an abortionist to take the life of other babies at the same stage in development as Saybie. Why do the lives of their children not matter?  </p>, <p>According to abortion advocates, life depends upon the state of mind of the mother – whether the child is “wanted.” That’s a nonsensical argument refuted by science. </p>, <p>Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry make billions of dollars each year from scared mothers and dead babies. We are at a tipping point in our nation in which the facts can no longer be denied. Roe v. Wade is no longer in line with either science or public opinion. </p>, <p>People of conscience refuse to ignore the human right of a living human being to not be dismembered and discarded by a utilitarian society that finds the baby inconvenient. </p>, <p>More and more Americans agree and are overwhelmingly <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/communications/american-attitudes-abortion-knights-of-columbus-marist-poll-slides.pdf"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">rejecting</a></u> the radical abortion extremism we have seen in states like Virginia and New York. </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Recent pro-life legislation in states like Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana is partly a response to the left’s rejection of truth. Americans are now in the process of setting new boundaries, given these undeniable scientific facts of human life like Saybie.</p>, <p>Roe v. Wade must go because it is no longer supported by science or common sense. States will fight out their own boundaries, but one thing is certain: Saybie is living proof that science is pro-life.</p>, <p><strong style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif'><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/n/penny-young-nance"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PENNY YOUNG NANCE</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">'Fox Report' provides some insight into the horrors of human trafficking and the steps that law enforcement is taking to put a stop to it.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">When people fall prey to sex traffickers, it can take a village of law enforcement agencies and advocacy organizations to pull them from the sex work they’re forced to endure. Detectives, officers and FBI agents often coordinate efforts to rescue those who are trapped and put their abusers behind bars. </p>, <p class=""speakable"">The ease with which traffickers transport their victims makes the work of investigators and law enforcement agencies even more complicated. The women are often sold online -- and raped in person. Much of the police work is done on the Internet, a task that can weigh on investigators enduring long hours and reviewing endless streams of disturbing content.</p>, <p>As part of an <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/undertow-of-exploitation-how-teens-get-trapped-in-human-trafficking"">ongoing investigation into the practice of human trafficking</a>, in which someone is sold into sexual exploitation or forced labor, Fox News interviewed law enforcement officials at state and federal levels to better understand efforts to stop the shocking practice.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Those corridors are so hot with human trafficking activity that, at times, we put together a task force just to attack those corridors.</p>, <p>“They’re hiding in plain sight,” said Cpl. Alan Wilkett, a veteran of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office in Florida. “The trafficker is comfortable in that there’s such high transit [on the highways] that it becomes difficult to spot the activity.”</p>, <p>Wilkett, who spearheads a human trafficking task force for Pasco County, told Fox that highways are often used to transport trafficking victims from city to city, where they are forced to “work” by their captors.</p>, <p>“If a trafficker is getting his victim from one place to another, for instance, a high-end or high-populace activity that’s happening in Tampa … he’s going to use the I-4 corridor,” Wilkett said. “In fact, those corridors are so hot with human trafficking activity that, at times, we put together a task force just to attack those corridors,” he explained.  </p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>Law enforcement task forces, often coordinated between different agencies, are a common tactic to combat a variety of crimes – including human trafficking. Often, the FBI will partner with a local police department to conduct sting operations on traffickers. Such is the case in Toledo, Ohio, where Det. Peter Swartz leads the department’s efforts in the fight. </p>, <p>Swartz, who focuses full time on human trafficking, pulls double duty as a detective for the Toledo Police Department and a field agent for the FBI. He said he sees victims from across the country who have been trafficked through Toledo. </p>, <p>“They were on their way to Florida, Atlanta, Georgia. You know, Orlando, Tampa,” he said. “We know some victims end up there and some of our traffickers end up there,” Swartz told Fox. </p>, <p class=""quote-text"">A lot of the cases that we work with, the predators, the pimps, the trafficker are getting substantial sentences for turning out our kids.</p>, <p>Swartz said he gets fulfillment from the work, even though he’s often dealing with minors who have been trafficked against their will. More importantly, he said the people coercing them into forced sex work are facing consequences. </p>, <p>“I think we’ve made a significant difference as far as sex trafficking,” Swartz said. “A lot of the cases that we work with, the predators, the pimps, the trafficker are getting substantial sentences for turning out our kids,” he added.</p>, <p>Having investigators focusing specifically on sex trafficking, like Swartz, has become increasingly important as sex trafficking continues to become more commonplace. In Ohio, the attorney general’s human trafficking commission reported that law enforcement agencies across the state investigated 242 instances of human trafficking in 2017. It made 80 arrests and secured 61 convictions. </p>, <p>
      Toledo Police Department Det. Peter Swartz in an interview with Fox News.
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Swartz said a large portion of his day consists of following up on tips he’s given by different organizations like Crime Stoppers, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the local Missing Persons Bureau.</p>, <p>“Basically, we use an undercover officer to call an ad that may be advertising for escorting, but we know it’s an ad for prostitution,” Swartz said. “Then we’ll try to recover them and find out what’s going on with them and what led [them] to this work,” he told Fox. </p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Most of the victims are folks that are in such vulnerable positions they are not able to make their own decisions.</p>, <p>The enforcement tactics use by Swartz and the Toledo police are much the same as those used by the FBI. William Sweeney, the assistant director in charge of the New York field office, said the agency has increased its focuses and resources to fight human trafficking. </p>, <p>“Most of the victims are folks that are in such vulnerable positions they are not able to make their own decisions,” Sweeney said, adding that “they are exploited by perpetrators all across the region.” </p>, <p>
      Jon Scott talks with Assistant Director in Charge William Sweeney and FBI Special Agent Brian Gander.
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Sweeney and his agents participate in the FBI’s flagship human trafficking enforcement action, Operation Cross Country. In 2017, the agency conducted its 11th iteration of the sting operation. According to a report released by the bureau, the operation took place “in 55 FBI field offices and involved 78 state and local task forces, consisting of hundreds of law enforcement partners.”</p>, <p>Operation Cross Country XI recovered 84 minors and arrested 120 traffickers. The focus of the operation was specifically on underage victims. Some critics of the effort have complained that the operation needlessly sweeps up willing sex workers, charging them with felonies and further perpetuating a lifestyle of crime. Still, few argue with the necessity of pulling teens from a life of rape and abuse.  </p>, <p>“That renewed focus, I think, has also led to increased reporting and then increased prosecutions and increased attention,” Sweeney said. “So it really seems to feed upon itself – which is good in the fact that we’re helping victims, [and] obviously bad in the fact that you realize how pervasive it actually is.”  </p>, <p><em>If you are being trafficked or suspect that someone you know is being trafficked contact The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-THE-LOST or CYBERTIPLINE.ORG.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

He said: “I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.”</p>, <p>When told Meghan had threatened to leave for Canada if he won in 2016, he countered: “A lot of people are moving here (to the US).”</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/serena-williams-duchess-meghan-markle-baby-archie-visit"" target=""_blank"">SERENA WILLIAMS VISITS MEGHAN MARKLE, BABY ARCHIE: REPORT</a></strong></p>, <p>He also revealed that he had no idea that he wouldn’t be meeting Meghan on his <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8917796/when-donald-trump-visit-uk-meet-queen/"">three-day state visit to the UK</a>.

She said: “It’s really the moment I go. We film 'Suits' in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada.</p>, <p>“Yes, of course, Trump is divisive, think about female voters alone, right?"" she said. “I think it was in 2012 the Republican Party lost the female vote by 12 points.""</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-father-lifetime-harry-meghan-becoming-royal"" target=""_blank"">MEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SLAMS LIFETIME'S 'HARRY &amp; MEGHAN: BECOMING ROYAL' AS 'DUMB FICTION'</a></strong></p>, <p>“That is a huge number and with as misogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that is a huge chunk of it.”</p>, <p>She added: “You’re not just voting for a woman if it’s Hillary (Clinton).

I like Charles. I think that’s very good. We will be talking. I can say we have among the cleanest climate in the world right now.""</p>, <p>“Our air and water are doing very well. We hope other countries can do so well. You know, it is a big atmosphere and frankly if one country is going to be bad and other countries going to be good, the country that is good gets penalized.

Harvard’s preference for the Teutonic tones of Chancellor <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/angela-merkel"">Angela Merkel</a> over the New York English of President Trump reflects the sad state of how our nation converses — and how we represent ourselves to the world.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/german-chancellor-angela-merkel-uses-harvard-commencement-speech-to-swipe-trump""><strong>MERKEL USES HARVARD COMMENCEMENT SPEECH TO SWIPE AT TRUMP</strong></a></p>, <p>The annual ritual of graduation speeches is part of our national conversation. Covered by the media and widely shared among “regular people,” these addresses present thoughts on values, wisdom, hope, challenge, change, compassion, and aspirations.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Increasingly, elite liberal colleges look more like a sinkhole of student debt, and ground zero for the greedy and intolerant face of education corporatism.</p>, <p>Harvard gave Merkel its coveted platform to share her musings with the world. But neither that hallowed institution — nor, so far as I can tell, any other university aside from military academies — appears to have invtied the U.S. president to speak.</p>, <p>The American academy, it seems, would prefer that Trump stay off their campuses and keep his thoughts to himself.</p>, <p>One the same day Merkel spoke at Harvard, Trump spoke to the graduating class of the Air Force Academy (a great institution, though it pains me, a West Point grad, to admit it). It was a big day for the cadets — not just because they received their commissions, but because the commander in chief stayed on stage after his speech to shake the hands with every newly commissioned officer. That’s about 1,000 hands.</p>, <p>But presidents routinely appear as graduation speakers at the military academies. The absence this year of a presidential voice at a non-military university is disconcerting.</p>, <p>Clearly, institutional academia is no fan of President Trump. But its disdain extends far beyond the president, encompassing virtually all things — and speakers — smacking of conservatism. That’s not new this year. I’ve been unable to identify a single Ivy League school that featured a conservative commencement speaker in the last three years.</p>, <p>Conservative addresses at major universities are about as prominent as kale in Hannibal Lecter’s fridge. For every Arthur Brooks invited on campus there is an army of Madeleine Albrights and Michael Bloombergs. Even the long list of actors, writers, scholars and corporate bigwigs tends to lean left.</p>, <p>This holds true for more than just cap-and-gown ceremonies. Shutting down conservative voices is starting to look like a required course. Williams College recently drew national attention over the issue. Such stories seem more and more common.</p>, <p>And, it’s not just home-grown liberal activists trying to squelch “unacceptable” voices. There is an alarming trend of foreign Chinese students on American campuses organizing campaigns to silence speech unfavorable to their country</p>, <p>Conservatives and others who value free speech and open inquiry find these developments concerning. The president is so concerned, he has issued an executive order to protect free speech on campuses. It’s a sensible move, but one unlikely to make him many more friends in the faculty meetings.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>The academy complains that Trump poorly represents America to the world. But increasingly, American universities are the national embarrassment. They are more concerned about Trump’s tweets than serving as a national beacon of free, inclusive and diverse speech.</p>, <p>The real tragedy here is that the great universities are in danger of drifting away from the center of America’s public square. They are losing their relevance to the rest of us. Increasingly, elite liberal colleges look more like a sinkhole of student debt, and ground zero for the greedy and intolerant face of education corporatism.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/james-jay-carafano""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JAMES JAY CARAFANO</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Is this why Democrats are fired up about impeachment? American Conservative Union president Matt Schlapp reacts.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Ever since humanity identified the concept of a “future,” people have been trying to determine how to predict it: palms, winds, hexagrams, shamans, oracles … every culture has sought to identify the best way to foretell events.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">In recent weeks, attention has focused on several models that seem to have worked in the past and that predict the outcome of the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election"">2020 presidential election</a>. The models’ designers claim that they can be more accurate than using more commonly accepted voter polls to assess whether President Trump will win re-election. </p>, <p>The Fair Model, designed by Yale University Professor Jay Fair, uses a combination of economic growth, the power of incumbency and the voter tendency favoring change to estimate the popular vote share of the incumbent party. It got a boost from <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/opinion/trumps-formidable-2020-tailwind.html"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">The New York Times</a> recently, which pointed out that the model accurately predicted Trump would win in 2016, and that it predicts him getting re-elected in 2020.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-fox-news-town-hall-last-standing""><strong>STRUGGLING IN POLLS, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND HOPES FOX NEWS TOWN HALL CAN HELP HER 'BE AMONG THE LAST STANDING'</strong></a></p>, <p>The Keys to the White House Model – developed by American University Professor Alan Lichtman and Russian scientist Vladimir Keilis-Borok – uses even more factors, including the strength of the incumbent party, party unity, apparent scandals, social unrest, and charisma of the candidates. It also looks at the success of policy changes by the incumbent and economic strength to predict who will win.</p>, <p>Both models currently forecast that Trump will easily win re-election. And several other models, including ones that focus on the Electoral College, also suggest a second Trump term. </p>, <p>At the same time, recent polls suggest that over half the electorate would vote against Trump, with his job approval rating in the mid-40 percent range.</p>, <p>The most recent Fox News poll showed several potential Democratic nominees with solid leads over Trump, with former Vice President Joe Biden beating the president 49 percent to 38 percent.</p>, <p>Who deserves our faith? The econometric and incumbency modeling shamans? Or the polling oracles? You need both to understand what’s going on politically as we head toward the 2020 elections.</p>, <p>I’d argue the models are correct to conclude that the state of the economy and the strength of incumbency have been key factors in affecting how people think (and therefore vote).</p>, <p>But while the models have worked in the past, they’ve not done as good a job in predicting the vote for Trump. Indeed, both the models mentioned suggested Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 – but he lost by 2 points.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Who deserves our faith? The econometric and incumbency modeling shamans? Or the polling oracles? You need both to understand what’s going on politically as we head toward the 2020 elections.</p>, <p>Still, the polls are right that Trump remains vastly less popular than a president ought to be under current conditions.</p>, <p>The American economy is on a tear right now, and we’re about to enter the longest economic expansion in history. That is an ideal environment for an incumbent. </p>, <p>If voters were faced with the choice of an unnamed Republican incumbent versus any Democratic challenger under current conditions, voters would clearly opt for the incumbent by a wide popular vote and Electoral College margins.</p>, <p>But an unnamed Republican incumbent will not be on the ballot next year. Trump will be.</p>, <p>Trump’s persona takes attention away from the successes of Trump’s administration. In fact, Trump is such a powerful presence that people wind up considering not should we re-elect Current Policies (I’d bet we would), but should we sign up for another four years of The Trump Show?</p>, <p>The polls suggest the public is looking for a different show. </p>, <p>So in the coming months, I’d look at both the models and the polls. </p>, <p>Should Trump submerge his personality to enable the public to focus on the success of his policies, one should expect that the models will turn out to be more accurate. But if the president’s personality remains in the center ring of the political circus, I’d focus primarily on betting with the polls. </p>, <p>In reading polls, it’s important to look underneath the numbers. Too often, folks focus on the difference between the main candidates, and each candidate’s actual number. </p>, <p>In 2016, many people focused on how Hillary Clinton was ahead of Trump in many key states in the Midwest, and therefore was likely to win. But in those states where she was leading, she was actually sitting in the mid-40s, while Trump was in the low 40s. </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>There were a large number of undecided voters. When folks just looked at the difference, they were expecting the undecideds to split evenly among Trump and Clinton. But they didn’t. They went disproportionately to Trump, enabling him to eke out a victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and thus move into the White House.</p>, <p>If the polls continue to show the Democrat with close to or over 50 percent of the vote, then I’d expect the Dems to be able to win. Should the Democrat hover in the mid-40s – with a large undecided vote – then it’s very possible Trump will be in a position to win over a large chunk of the undecided voters and get another four years in the White House.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/arnon-mishkin"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ARNON MISHKIN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>Both MSNBC host Chris Hayes and CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger dissected Mueller’s Wednesday news conference about his report, relying on either “reading between the lines” or “If you read between the lines.” </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/media-flooded-with-impeachment-stories-despite-tepid-backing-on-capitol-hill""><strong>MEDIA FLOODED WITH IMPEACHMENT STORIES, DESPITE TEPID BACKING ON CAPITOL HILL</strong></a></p>, <p>It was reminiscent of the great movie “Network,” where the TV network entertainment division took over news and installed programs including “Sybil: The Soothsayer.” </p>, <p>The media didn’t stop there. ABC’s Senior National Correspondent Terry Moran did his own reading between the lines. “This is Robert Mueller saying to Congress do your job. It is time to take this up,” he said.</p>, <p>”CBS This Morning” co-host Tony Dokoupil also wanted the same kind of guesswork from reporter Major Garrett: “What words stood out to you? What messages were embedded in those remarks?” </p>, <p>NBC was thrilled by the idea of impeachment. “Today” host Savannah Guthrie followed suit, also interpreting what Mueller said. “He’s without using that word reminding folks that there is a process and it’s called impeachment,” she said.</p>, <p>Legal analyst Mimi Rocah couldn’t hide her hopes. “And I hope that now Congress picks up that mantle more and does it in a more effective way,” she said. “And I think that’s what Mueller was asking them to do.”</p>, <p>The mood was similar at sister network MSNBC where “Morning Joe” immediately shifted into attack mode. Branding expert Donny Deutsch wanted to shift the narrative away from impeachment, but not from the action. “It’s a losing word,” he told viewers. Instead, “you take the word impeachment, and you change it to ‘criminal activity.’” </p>, <p class=""quote-text"">What is especially humorous is that even The New York Times admitted that no one agreed what Mueller had said in his brief presentation.</p>, <p>Deutsch had grand visions of liberal success, all with a minor word change. “We are going to initiate and continue the ongoing Trump criminal investigations. Trump criminal, Trump criminal investigations,” he said.</p>, <p>The hour changed, but the script didn’t. MSNBC anchor Kasie Hunt kept talking the magic “I” word with her “Big Question.” </p>, <p>“What more do congressional Democrats need to hear before they make a decision about impeachment?” Hunt asked. She wanted New York Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries to explain “why not begin impeachment proceedings?”</p>, <p>One of MSNBC’s resident RINOs (Republicans in name only), Elise Jordan, whined that Mueller wouldn’t testify and help undermine Trump. She compared his stance to a book author who said, ""Oh, I’m not going to go promote my book, just read the book and you'll learn what it’s all about.""</p>, <p>Contributor Malcolm Nance went even further, alleging Trump’s was utilizing a strategy of distraction that came “straight from the KGB playbook.” “There is a conspiracy out there,” he said, not seeming to care how silly that looked.</p>, <p>What is especially humorous is that even The New York Times admitted that no one agreed what Mueller had said in his brief presentation. The paper ran an analysis under this headline: “Mueller Delivered a Message. Washington Couldn’t Agree on What It Was.” That’s pretty much true of every major issue of the day.</p>, <p>The Times also published an opinion piece from Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky urging Mueller to get more political. “He is serving a vision of America that no longer exists,” Tomasky wrote, arguing that Mueller can’t serve the apolitical America by being … apolitical. </p>, <p><strong>Media Can’t Cover Abortion Objectively</strong></p>, <p>Few things motivate most journalists like backing “social justice” causes. One of their favorites is abortion. It doesn’t matter how extreme a liberal position is on abortion, journalists will back it.</p>, <p>With the passage of pro-life measures in several states, the media haven’t even pretended neutrality. The parent companies of NBC, ABC and CBS all threw in with the left on the debate and threatened to withdraw their tapings from Georgia because of a new pro-life law. </p>, <p>CNN flat-out denied reality in one abortion story, headlined “Pence discusses abortion with Trudeau, repeats Trump's 'infanticide' claim.” </p>, <p>According to CNN White House producer Kevin Liptak and reporter Caroline Kelly, Pence was “echoing false claims made last month by President Donald Trump about doctors killing babies that have already been born.”</p>, <p>If journalists were honest, they’d call this CNN story a lie. Because that’s what it is. Here, one more time, is the Jan. 30 quote from Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam: “The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired.”</p>, <p>That’s precisely what Trump was addressing. But CNN has memory-holed it. Instead, anchor Jim Sciutto said new life-saving laws are “really turning back the clock, really to pre-1973, when that was the law of the land in a number of places.” </p>, <p>NPR brought on Dr. Colleen McNicholas, who performs abortions, and who referred to babies as “pregnancy tissue.” How many American women think their future babies are “pregnancy tissue?” </p>, <p>The CNN documentary series “United Shades of America” decided to emulate the rest of the press and ignore pro-life voices. Host and comedian W. Kamau Bell didn’t leave his pro-life interviews on the cutting-room floor, he just hid them in the online version of his documentary. </p>, <p>Hollywood joined the boycott calls. Director Ron Howard’s career has gone from playing Opie on the family-friendly “Andy Griffith Show” to telling Georgians he won’t film there because of pro-life laws won’t allow the butchery of more babies. That’s some character (or lack of character).</p>, <p><strong>Run Across the Border</strong></p>, <p>The immigration crisis is in the news again and that’s a perfect opportunity for the media to remind everyone they support open borders. Here’s just one excellent example.</p>, <p>CNN’s Christiane Amanpour showed her liberal stripes in an interview with Europe’s open border queen – German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Amanpour piled praise on Merkel’s “compassionate, courageous migration program, allowing a million or more people in.” Nice and neutral, that.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>The CNN International anchor went further, describing Merkel in the eyes of those who love her: “Analysts and historians today describe you as the face of good Germans, good Germany.” </p>, <p>It’s a key reminder that most journalists are globalists, which is why they attack nationalists so strongly.

</p>, <p>At issue is Mueller’s decision to punt on the question of whether President Trump should be indicted for obstruction of justice. In his startling remarks, Mueller sought to justify himself by citing instruction from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The longstanding OLC opinion, an outgrowth of Nixon- and Clinton-era scandals, holds that a sitting president may not be indicted. The two press offices were struggling to reconcile (a) Mueller’s pointed reliance on this OLC guidance at the presser with (b) his prior disclaimers of such reliance.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>According to Attorney General William Barr, in a meeting over two weeks before Mueller submitted his final report, the special counsel emphatically denied that his refusal to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction hinged on the OLC guidance. Naturally, in their continuing quest to frame Barr as the most diabolical villain since Lex Luthor, the media-Democrat complex insisted that the AG must be lying.</p>, <p>This is what derangement will do to you. I do not think Mueller’s contradictory assertions are that hard to figure out. But if you were inclined to blame sleight of hand, the culprit would be Mueller. You’ll notice that when we finally heard from him on Wednesday, he lauded Barr’s good faith, never claiming that the AG had misrepresented him. Moreover, the conversation between them on the OLC guidance was not a one-on-one affair. There were other people in the room when Mueller denied that the OLC guidance was his rationale for abdicating.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-investigation-was-always-impeachment-probe/"">CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</a></strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://CLICK%20HERE%20TO%20GET%20THE%20FOX%20NEWS%20APP""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Whether you need it to be an urban voyager or an off-road adventurer, the 2018 Jeep® Wrangler offers one-of-a-kind style and capability.
</p>, <p>I was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, elevation 338-feet above sea level. I camped out as an Eagle and Boy Scout and fell in love with mountains on a family vacation to <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/colorado"" target=""_blank"">Colorado</a>. As an adult, I moved to Colorado and later to Switzerland for my job and climbed some of the most famous peaks in the Alps. But I never dreamed that I would summit Everest, much less her tougher little sister, K2.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/everest-climbing-record-rules-change-deaths"" target=""_blank"">CALIFORNIA WOMAN WHO BROKE EVEREST CLIMBING RECORD SAW FOUR BODIES DURING EXPEDITION, SAYS RULES MUST CHANGE TO STOP DEATHS</a></strong></p>, <p>I attempted Everest three times before accomplishing my goal on the fourth try at age 54 in 2011. Sitting on the summit, covered in goose down-filled clothes and staring at my heavy yellow boots, I quietly pulled the hood over my head and let my tears freely run down my frozen face.</p>, <p>Yes, as a climber, I was humbled and grateful but my emotions were driven more from my mom, Ida’s death a few years earlier from Alzheimer’s Disease. You see, often climbing mountains is not about the climb but the reason behind the climb.</p>, <p>I was sucker-punched this year when I saw the picture taken by Nirmal Purja Magar of the long line of climbers at the Hillary Step. They were almost to the summit on the more popular Nepal side of the mountain. The evidence in this image showed what is so wrong on Everest these days. It told me that in addition to the explainable reason that the weather limited the acceptable days from the usual dozen to only a few, but it also told me that there were too many people on Everest that had not earned the privilege, they had simply bought a ticket, to attempt to climb the highest mountain on our planet.</p>, <p>Many people who have seen the image, use it as Exhibit A in the trial that Everest, and perhaps mountaineering as a sport, is broken. The media coverage of the 11 deaths on Everest dwarfed the coverage of the deaths of some of the best climbers in the world earlier this year.</p>, <p>Tom Ballard was the son of Alison Hargreaves who was the first woman to summit Everest without supplemental oxygen. He and his partner Daniel Nardi both died in February on the 8,000-meter peak Nanga Pabart. Then in April, elite climbers, American Jess Roskelley and Austrians David Lama and Hansjörg Auer were killed in an avalanche on Canada’s Howse Peak attempting a very difficult new route. The coverage lasted a day, this year’s Everest coverage is still in full bloom.</p>, <p>I get it. The elite climbers understand the bargain with the mountain. They attempt the almost impossible, reap the rewards through sponsors and more, climbing while the 11 who died on Everest were just regular people following a dream, no matter how unprepared.</p>, <p>Ten years ago, you had to spend $45,000 or even $65,000 to get on an Everest team. Today, you can buy your way on to a team for well under $30,000. Natural market dynamics have created competition. But not all guides are the same, just like flying is not the same on all airlines … but the personal risks are drastically different.</p>, <p>There are no significant requirements to join an Everest team. Just pay your $11,000 permit fee to the Nepal government, find a team and get to Kathmandu in early April. Many guides only ask about the money, not the experience. They tell their customers that they will teach them everything they need to know. No experience needed. The best guides vet their clients and don’t accept anyone who lacks basic and proven mountaineering experience. There is a difference.</p>, <p>I was once told by a low-cost operator that I didn’t need to train for Annapurna, the world’s most-deadly 8,000-meter mountain. Just come over.</p>, <p>On May 23rd, each person standing in line just below Everest’s summit was using up their limited supply of life-giving bottled oxygen. They must have looked at the person ahead and behind and wondered. But where was the leadership? The famed “Sherpa Guides” -- as the Nepal Tourism department anointed everyone with the last name of Sherpa -- who worked on Everest. This was to address the negative publicity that there were not enough guides. It was similar to saying everyone on an airplane was a pilot. Nepal excels in tourism public relations.</p>, <p>The Sherpas and Western Guides who were there saved multiple lives. They saw the long lines. They knew someone had to take control. The most experienced guides directed traffic. The strongest Sherpas, literally dragged the fallen down the mountain. Many Sherpas gave up their own personal supply of oxygen to their clients, again saving lives. The best Sherpas showed why many of them are the best Everest climbers. And many of the weakest customers proved that they should have been turned back hours earlier by their mountain guardians.</p>, <p>What lessons have been learned from this year? Sadly, the same ones offered in 1996, 2006 and 2012: inexperience kills, not all guides are the same, money buys access, the weather has the last word. And Nepal is in continuous denial about the problems, blinded by the tens of millions brought in each spring, deaths be damned.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Mountaineering is a very personal sport.

</p>, <p>Mueller was insinuating that President Trump has not been exonerated of wrongdoing, while refusing to explicitly declare the president guilty of any crime.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/deroy-murdock-did-mueller-sit-on-his-no-collusion-conclusion""><strong>DEROY MURDOCK: DID MUELLER SIT ON HIS NO-COLLUSION CONCLUSION?</strong></a></p>, <p>As Alan Dershowitz noted in <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thehill.com_opinion_judiciary_445983-2Ddershowitz-2Dshame-2Don-2Drobert-2Dmueller-2Dfor-2Dexceeding-2Dhis-2Drole&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=AA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7_DqJFkmec&amp;m=80oCImeyM28NEc_uiSaXyZ4P41dgRagytMIh9EGLmD4&amp;s=UrpkCWunXNn8BnlYAwR5gTQHsaTm4_oOmkNG1zq-kxg&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">The Hill</a>, FBI Director James Comey was “universally criticized” for attempting a similar political dance during the Hillary Clinton email investigation. </p>, <p>At the time, Comey had said that there was no clear evidence that Clinton intended to break the law, but there was evidence that she was “extremely careless” in her handling of classified information (which can be ruled a crime) while she was secretary of state.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">After a nearly two-year investigation consisting of 15 lawyers, many millions of taxpayer dollars, and interviews of more than 500 witnesses, everything in Mueller’s 448-page report leads to the conclusion that President Trump is not guilty of any crimes.</p>, <p>In Mueller’s case, it was much worse. Dershowitz rightly pointed out that Mueller “went beyond the conclusion of his report and gave a political gift to Democrats in Congress who are seeking to institute impeachment proceedings against President Trump.” </p>, <p>Mueller’s report said there was no evidence President Trump broke the law. Mueller’s mouth said there was no proof<em> </em>Trump didn’t.</p>, <p>The problem is, Mueller’s verbal statement distorted the role of a prosecutor and flipped a core concept of the American justice system on its head – the idea that people are innocent until proven guilty. </p>, <p>Dating back to John Adams’s principled defense of British soldiers against an incensed public after the Boston Massacre, Americans have held that proving the burden of guilt falls on the state.</p>, <p>And the bottom line is: After a nearly two-year investigation consisting of 15 lawyers, many millions of taxpayer dollars, and interviews of more than 500 witnesses, everything in Mueller’s 448-page report leads to the conclusion that President Trump is not guilty of any crimes. </p>, <p>Like Independent Counsel Ken Starr, who declared in his report that there was “substantial and credible evidence” that President Bill Clinton was guilty of 11 separate counts of criminal activity (including obstruction of justice), Mueller could have concluded that President Trump obstructed justice without citing any formal charges. He declined to do so.</p>, <p>Sean Davis, writing in <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thefederalist.com_2019_05_29_mueller-2Djust-2Dproved-2Dhis-2Dentire-2Doperation-2Dwas-2Da-2Dpolitical-2Dhit-2Djob-2Dthat-2Dtrampled-2Dthe-2Drule-2Dof-2Dlaw_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=AA442jMvbCURPtZiNmMNtJBnripGQYCHw7_DqJFkmec&amp;m=80oCImeyM28NEc_uiSaXyZ4P41dgRagytMIh9EGLmD4&amp;s=NR9oavwtj1fM77H9iepeOdnbDN76fs2lvUKhD5Cp7N4&amp;e="" target=""_blank"">The Federalist</a>, also pointed out that Mueller’s politicization of his investigation was self-refuting. Mueller had said that “it is important that the office’s written work speak for itself,” but then he kept talking.</p>, <p>As Davis wrote: “Mueller’s report was released to the public by Attorney General William Barr nearly six weeks ago. The entire report, minus limited redactions required by law, has been publicly available, pored through, and dissected. … If it’s important for the work to speak for itself, then why did Mueller schedule a press conference in which he would speak for it weeks after it was released?”</p>, <p>Mueller is making the political suggestion that President Trump should be impeached on allegations of obstruction of justice for which Mueller and his team of hot-shot lawyers found no proof. This is a clear example of a prosecutor who is trying to get an outcome regardless of evidence. In a desperate pursuit to keep the bogus Russia collusion narrative alive, Mueller is turning to Soviet-style tactics.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>The foundations of our justice system have served us well for 243 years.

It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers, Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will  be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs),” Trump tweeted early Sunday.</p>, <p>“America has had enough!” he added.</p>, <p>Trump announced the new tariffs, which are slated to go into effect on June 10, on Thursday. The president said a new 5 percent tariff would be placed on all Mexican imports to pressure the country to do more to help crack down on the surge of migrants trying to cross the U.S. Southern border. Trump warned, though, that the tariff percentage would gradually increase up to 25 percent “until the illegal immigration problem is remedied.”</p>, <p>Fox News has learned that the tariffs, on all goods by land, sea, and air from Mexico, will hike up to 10 percent on July 1, 15 percent on August 1, 20 percent on September 1, and to 25 percent by October 1.</p>, <p>“Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until Mexico substantially stops the illegal flow of aliens coming through its territory,” the White House said in a statement this week.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mexican-president-expects-good-results-at-u-s-mexico-talks-open-to-reinforcing-efforts-to-stop-migrants"" target=""_blank""><strong>MEXICAN PRESIDENT SAYS HE EXPECTS 'GOOD RESULTS' FROM TARIFF NEGOTIATIONS WITH US</strong></a></p>, <p>But upon the announcement of the new tariffs, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador dispatched his foreign relations secretary to Washington on Friday, as the country scrambled to negotiate a solution with the U.S.</p>, <p>Over the weekend, though, Obrador said he expects “good results” from the upcoming talks in Washington and reportedly suggested he is open to reinforcing efforts to stem illegal immigration. Obrador said that Mexican officials plan to convey to the Trump administration what they have been doing to stop illegal immigration, and added that they are open to additional  measures “without violating human rights.”</p>, <p>In a letter to Trump on Thursday following the announcements of the tariffs, Obrador said that “social problems are not solved with duties or coercive measures,” and added that the United States has a history of being a nation of immigrants.</p>, <p>“The Statue of Liberty is not an empty symbol,” he wrote in the letter.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, on Sunday, the president blasted congressional Democrats, claiming they “are doing nothing” to address securing the border.</p>, <p>“The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes!” he tweeted.</p>, <p>Trump added: “The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!”</p>, <p>The president’s tweets come as the border sees a historic number of migrants attempting to enter the U.S.</p>, <p>Last week, more than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents near the U.S.-Mexico border—the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told Fox News.</p>, <p>The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources.</p>, <p>There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to CBP.

Join us for this Historic Rally!” Trump tweeted over the weekend, with a link for supporters to register for tickets to the event.</p>, <p>Trump announced his first presidential run on June 16, 2015, from Trump Tower in New York City.</p>, <p>While Trump will officially announce his 2020 bid, his campaign has been up and running for months. The Trump re-election campaign offices are open in Washington, D.C., and in New York City.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, there are 23 Democratic candidates vying to compete against Trump in the general election. Many of those candidates are pushing Socialist policies like “Medicare-for-all” and the “Green New Deal,” and Trump’s campaign plans to stitch a counter-“Socialist” theme into their message.</p>, <p>“We see them as a homogenous group of Socialists,” Trump campaign’s national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News.</p>, <p>But Trump has specifically taken aim at former Vice President Joe Biden, who, according to the latest polls, is leading in the crowded Democratic primary field in the double digits.</p>, <p>Trump has said he would beat “sleepy”  Biden “easily” in 2020, and has said the former vice president does not have enough “energy” to hold the post — in an apparent swipe at his age.</p>, <p>“I think we’d beat him easily,” Trump, who is turning 73 later this month, said.</p>, <p>“I feel like a young man. I am a young, vibrant man,” Trump said. “I look at Joe, I don’t know about him.”</p>, <p>The president’s comments seemingly were a shot at the age of Biden, who is 76.</p>, <p>“I would never say anyone’s too old,” Trump said. “I know they’re all making me look very young, both in terms of age and in terms of energy.”</p>, <p>Biden became the 20th candidate to join the crowded Democratic primary field. But Biden is not the oldest in the pack. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is 77.</p>, <p>Should Trump be re-elected, he will be 74 on Jan. 20, 2021 — Inauguration Day. Should the presidency go to one of the elder Democrats in the field — Biden would be 78; Sanders would be 79, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., would be 71.</p>, <p>While Trump has dubbed some 2020 candidates with nicknames and criticized their policies, almost every candidate in the Democratic primary field is running on one message -- get Trump out of office.</p>, <p>Just this week, many Democratic candidates called for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against the president, following a rare announcement from Special Counsel Robert Mueller saying that charging the president with a crime was ""not an option"" due to longstanding Justice Department policy and that the Constitution allows for different venues to hold the president accountable for alleged wrongdoings and misconduct.</p>, <p>Mueller's Russia investigation, which has left a cloud over the Trump presidency, is officially complete. Mueller found no evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Mueller led an inquiry into whether the president obstructed justice, but did not come to a conclusion on the matter. Congressional Democrats have seized on that lack of decision and have used Mueller's public statement last week as a signal to intensify talks on impeachment.</p>, <p>The Democratic primary candidates are set to face-off for the first time in Miami, Fla., later this month.</p>, <p>And as for Trump’s re-election slogan, McEnany said the campaign will continue to use “Make America Great Again,"" even if re-tooled to something like “MAGA ’20.”</p>, <p>“Everyone knows MAGA,” McEnany said. “Everyone knows the red hat.”</p>, <p><em>Fox News’ Alex Pappas contributed to this report.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

What better way to counter President Trump’s division than to inspire and enable young people to do good with their lives?</p>, <p>Here’s how my plan would work: </p>, <p>Individuals who commit to serve one year of public service would be awarded tax-free financial assistance to attend two years of public or community college tuition-free, and those who serve two years would be able to attend four years free.</p>, <p>Those public servants who don’t want to attend a public college or who already have received an undergraduate degree can use the equivalent tax-free financial assistance towards the cost of a private education, to get a graduate degree, to pay down existing student debt, to participate in an accredited job-training program, to start a business, or to purchase a home. </p>, <p>Beyond the financial benefit, these public servants would be filling critically needed roles in our communities. These include special education aides and teaching assistants, home health aides and nurses for nonprofit providers, social workers, public defenders and first responders, as well as certain nonprofit work and jobs in federal, state, local and tribal governments.</p>, <p>My plan would help graduates by improving the current federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to assist qualified public servants with any debt beyond the new financial award. </p>, <p>This plan would also prioritize lifting up public service leaders in communities that have been left behind. A bonus financial award to pay down college debt, train for an in-demand job, start a business, or purchase a home would be made available to qualified graduates who locate to communities in particular need, such as rural and urban areas facing persistent poverty, population loss, or shortages in critical services.</p>, <p>This is especially important in areas of Iowa and New Hampshire that are losing talented students to other cities and states with higher-paying jobs.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>As president, I would have my plan administered by a new Cabinet-level director of national public service to elevate the priority of public service for the government and our nation. State and local boards would ensure that community and regional public service needs are being met through federal service programs and incentives to attract public service professionals to high-need areas. </p>, <p>The crushing debt and limited financial freedom faced by far too many Americans is a big problem to solve, but it’s also a unique opportunity to meet a problem with a ready solution – providing every American who wants to answer the call to public service with the support they need to succeed. </p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>Donald Luster, the former mayor of Dixmoor, is accused of soliciting bribes from the owner of a towing company in a nearby suburb. Luster served as a consultant to Harvey.

The manager also agreed to hire Johnson to work security at the club, according to reports.</p>, <p>Around 2007 or 2008, Kellogg doubled the payoffs – which were referred to as “rent” or “pizza” - to $6,000, the manager told authorities. When the owner refused to pay, the club was shut down three separate times, he said, according to the <a href=""https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-harvey-police-st-0307-story.html"" target=""_blank"">Chicago Tribune</a>.</p>, <p>“Tell your boss to just pay the man,” a Harvey cop said during the third visit, or words to that effect, according to the complaint. The operator eventually caved and paid the $6,000 each month. The strip club owner wore a wire while making payoffs between October 2017 and May 2018, prosecutors said.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/sports/lack-of-backup-plan-doomed-first-responder-bowl"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Kellogg – who is nearing the end of a 16-year run as mayor – has been embroiled in controversy involving strip clubs before.

In 2004, Kellogg paid a $600,000 legal settlement to developers who accused the mayor of blocking plans to build a competing strip club.</p>, <p>The city of Harvey has battled financial troubles in recent years.

Philip Dunn of Valley Christian Assembly lost his <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vision-and-hearing"" target=""_blank"">eyesight</a> due to macular degeneration.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">the reverend was told he wouldn’t see the effects for possibly several years.

According to the ABC-affiliated news station <a href=""https://wchstv.com/news/local/charleston-pastor-regains-sight-after-14-years-in-the-dark"" target=""_blank"">WCHS</a>, one of Dunn’s cataracts had ruptured, which created the possibility of further damage to his optic nerve.

</p>, <p>Unlike in the U.S., where there are only two major political parties, Israel has a parliamentary government that requires the support of a majority of Knesset members from a coalition of small parties. That means one party needs the support of at least 61 members in the 120-member Knesset to govern the Jewish state. No single party has ever captured 61 Knesset seats on its own. </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-2nd-snap-election-parliament-dissolve""><strong>ISRAEL FACES 2ND SNAP ELECTION IN 2019 AS PARLIAMENT VOTES TO DISSOLVE ITSELF</strong></a></p>, <p>The collapse of Netanyahu’s coalition-building effort is a clear loss for the prime minister, his conservative Likud Party and really all of Israel, leaving the nation with a weak caretaker government in place. The only true winners are the foes of Israel. </p>, <p>Despite the April election that seemed to guarantee Netanyahu another term as prime minister, now neither the left nor the right can claim absolute victory.</p>, <p>Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p>Key questions now arise as we consider Israel’s fate.</p>, <p><strong>What happens to the Trump peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians?</strong></p>, <p>President Trump has been promising to unveil a still-undisclosed peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians since early in his administration, and asked his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to put the plan together. In fact, Kushner met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem Thursday to discuss the plan.</p>, <p>The peace plan, which deals primarily with economic and not political issues, was on life-support even before the dissolution of the Knesset. Palestinians are opposing it sight unseen to protest President Trump’s support of Israel, including his move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. Palestinians want to establish a capital in Jerusalem for their own state.</p>, <p>Now Netanyahu has no incentive to make big concessions to the Palestinians, for fear that could cost him votes in the September election. Even if he did make such concessions, Palestinians show no signs of being in the mood to make compromises on their ambitious goals.</p>, <p><strong>Can Netanyahu stay in office?</strong></p>, <p>While he remains in office until the September election, no one knows if Netanyahu will get the chance to try to form a new government by cobbling together another coalition. His Likud Party won 35 seats in the April election but was unable to get the support of an additional 26 Knesset members to form a government. </p>, <p>Another party could be asked by the president of Israel to form a coalition if it wins more seats than Likud in September or is believed to have a better chance of forming a governing coalition. </p>, <p>An anti-Netanyahu coalition gathered for a mass rally last week – including the Blue and White Party led by Benny Gantz, as well as the Labor Party, the Meretz Party, and even the Israeli Arab parties. But at this point it’s uncertain if this group of parties with differing agendas represents a real, credible and lasting alternative to Netanyahu that has the possibility of forming a coalition government.</p>, <p><strong>What is the impact of the religious divide among Israeli Jews?</strong></p>, <p>Israeli political parties are divided not just based on political ideology, but between Orthodox and other Jews. Orthodox parties have never won enough votes to form a government, but they can determine which larger party gets to govern my joining that party in a coalition.</p>, <p>Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman was expected to align his small ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu Party with Netanyahu’s Likud Party so Netanyahu could form a government after the April election. </p>, <p>But Lieberman’s refused to join Netanyahu’s government in a dispute over a law that would end the sweeping exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from the military draft. Lieberman – like many secular Israelis – wants the exemption ended. But Netanyahu refused to agree to that, because doing so would cost him the support of the religious parties he needs to form a majority coalition.</p>, <p>Now Netanyahu and members of the Likud Party are placing the blame for Likud’s failure to form a government squarely on Lieberman.</p>, <p>“Lieberman never intended to reach an agreement,” Netanyahu said following the collapse of his coalition-building effort. “He clearly wanted to shoot down this government and he is doing so because he reckons he will receive a few more votes” in a new election.</p>, <p>To be sure, it is not yet clear whether this is a short-term political tiff between Netanyahu and Lieberman will be papered over in a new election, or whether this will constitute a lasting separation by the ultranationalist Lieberman coalition that could jeopardize the religious coalition, and ultimately Netanyahu.</p>, <p>Similarly, it is important to consider whether this failure was about one issue that did not get resolved, or whether it is about the larger issue of whether Netanyahu has the support and the ability to bring together enough parties to control a Knesset majority of 61 seats.</p>, <p>This latest development also raises the question of what the makeup of the new Knesset will be after September. </p>, <p>High-profile parties such as the New Right Party led by Ayalet Shaked and Naftali Bennet just barely missed the threshold for Knesset representation in April. However, if they could capture more than the 3.25 percent of the vote needed for representation in the Knesset in the September election, the Israeli government would be much further to the right than ever before.</p>, <p><strong>Will Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges?</strong></p>, <p>As if trying to win more support in a new election so he can form a coalition government is not a big enough challenge, Netanyahu also faces the possibility of indictment in three corruption cases. Israel’s attorney general has set a hearing to make a final decision on charges for October, at which point a new government may or may not be formed.</p>, <p>After Israel’s elections in April, Netanyahu was poised to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister by far, and seemed unbeatable even in the face of corruption charges and fierce opposition. His grip on power has been truly remarkable, and the leverage he has had over all areas of life in Israel – ranging from security, to business, to the economy and the media – is unparalleled. </p>, <p>However, the question of whether Netanyahu can and will last in the face of these charges, a possible conviction, and a new election is now very legitimate.</p>, <p>Indeed, it is entirely possible that Netanyahu will be indicted either during, or more likely after, the second election campaign. His failure to form a government also impeded his plans to have the Knesset grant its members (including Netanyahu) immunity from prosecution while in office.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p>There are plenty of questions but few answers regarding the future of the nation’s politics and government.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/douglas-schoen"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUG SCHOEN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Fortunately, she said yes, because nothing ruins a good diving experience like a broken heart.</p>, <p>
      ""It was the most special moment. We even kissed through our masks,"" the bride-to-be said.
      <span class=""copyright"">(SWNS)</span></p>, <p>Grenier spent months planning the proposal, SWNS reports. The couple, who live in Georgia, booked a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. Grenier booked a boat, and made sure to sneak along his GoPro camera to capture the moment.</p>, <p>According to SWNS, Grenier was incredibly worried about losing the ring. So worried, in fact, that Seitz noticed he was acting oddly.</p>, <p>“Travis was insistent on wearing this fanny pack and I couldn’t understand why, but I just tried to forget about it,” Seitz told SWNS. “He even wore it into the water, which I thought was very weird, but I didn’t put two and two together.”</p>, <p>
      The couple actually got engaged on a ""snuba"" trip, which differs from scuba, in that divers wear an oxygen line that’s connected to the ship instead of a tank on their back.

The instructor started to gesture for us to get together for a picture on our GoPro towards the end of the dive,” Seitz told SWNS. “I stood up and when I looked down Travis was on his knee holding a little treasure chest. I opened the box and it was the most beautiful treasure I could have imagined. I started screaming. It was the most special moment.

</p>, <p>""If your soul is in New Orleans, I know what to give you,"" Chase said during an interview. ""I'm going to give you some jambalaya. I can give you some stewed chicken. I can give you some shrimp Creole.""</p>, <p>Chase, who fed generations of New Orleanians and tourists alike at Dooky Chase's restaurant, died Saturday. She was 96.</p>, <p>Chase's family released a statement to news outlets Saturday night, sharing that the woman they called a ""believer in the Spirit of New Orleans"" died surrounded by family.</p>, <p>""Her daily joy was not simply cooking, but preparing meals to bring people together,"" the family's statement read. ""One of her most prized contributions was advocating for the Civil Rights Movement through feeding those on the front lines of the struggle for human dignity.""</p>, <p>Leah Chase transformed the restaurant bearing — like her husband — her father-in-law's name from a sandwich shop where black patrons could buy lottery tickets to a refined restaurant where tourists, athletes, musicians — and even presidents — of all races dined.</p>, <p>Chase's determination propelled her from a girl with a small-town Louisiana upbringing to a celebrated chef who authored cookbooks, appeared on cooking shows and fed civil rights greats such as Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King Jr. Well into her 90s, Chase could be found every day at the restaurant, using a walker while greeting customers and supervising the kitchen.</p>, <p>""I love people and I love serving people. It's fun for me to serve people. Because sometimes people will come in and they're tired. And just a little plate of food will make people happy,"" she said during a 2015 interview with The Associated Press .</p>, <p>At a time when other black Creole women were working in the city's garment industry, Chase worked as a waitress in the French Quarter, which exposed her to the segregated city's pricey restaurants frequented by white people.</p>, <p>When she married Dooky Chase in 1946, his family restaurant had been open for five years — largely under the guidance of his mother. But Leah Chase wanted to make it a fine dining experience for black patrons, along the lines of what she had seen in the Quarter. Gradually, she introduced silverware on the table, tablecloths and Creole dishes.</p>, <p>""I said well why we can't have that for our people? Why we can't have a nice space? So I started trying to do different things,"" she said.</p>, <p>Dooky Chase's became known as a place where white and black civil rights activists could meet and strategize about voter registration drives or legal cases. Although Chase and her husband were breaking the law by allowing whites and blacks to eat together, police never raided the restaurant.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">""I love people and I love serving people. It's fun for me to serve people. Because sometimes people will come in and they're tired. And just a little plate of food will make people happy.""</p>, <p>She would also send food to jailed civil rights leaders, sniffing her nose at the notion of them eating prison food.</p>, <p>Sybil Morial, a longtime friend of Chase's, said she's eaten hundreds of meals at Dooky Chase's where she was courted by her late husband and the city's first black mayor, Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial. On visits to New Orleans, Thurgood Marshall and other lawyers would work with Morial's husband and NAACP lawyer, A.P. Tureaud, and then head to Dooky's for lunch or dinner.</p>, <p>""It was a haven for them to refresh themselves with wonderful gumbo and it was a place where they could strategize after a hard day's work,"" Morial said.</p>, <p>Chase never boasted about her works, saying simply that she did what she thought she had to do.</p>, <p>Hurricane Katrina in 2005 devastated her restaurant, where 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water lingered in the dining room for weeks. When the waters eventually receded, mold was everywhere.</p>, <p>Chase was already into her 80s, but there was little question regarding the restaurant's fate. Having evacuated to Birmingham, she and her husband returned to live in a FEMA trailer next to the restaurant for months, while they rebuilt Dooky Chase's.</p>, <p>She and her husband had been married for seven decades when he died in 2016 .</p>, <p>Her food always reflected her city, a Creole mixture of Spanish, French, African and other cultures that have influenced New Orleans. She also enjoyed new culinary influences in the city, like the growing number of Vietnamese and Jamaican restaurants.</p>, <p>With the exception of two photographs of former President Barack Obama, the restaurant has little evidence of the celebrities and dignitaries who came to eat. Instead of surrounding herself with the past, Chase tended to look forward.</p>, <p>""I want to do better,"" she said. ""I want to have the finest restaurant with the finest food. That's all I want.""</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved.

I didn’t know that she was nasty.”</p>, <p>When told Meghan had threatened to leave for Canada if he won in 2016, he countered: “A lot of people are moving here (to the US).”</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/serena-williams-duchess-meghan-markle-baby-archie-visit"" target=""_blank"">SERENA WILLIAMS VISITS MEGHAN MARKLE, BABY ARCHIE: REPORT</a></strong></p>, <p>He also revealed that he had no idea that he wouldn’t be meeting Meghan on his <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8917796/when-donald-trump-visit-uk-meet-queen/"">three-day state visit to the UK</a>. He said: “I didn’t know that.

He predicted she will make “a very good” American princess.</p>, <p>On her joining <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/royal-family/"">the Royal Family</a>, he added: “It is nice, and I am sure she will do excellently. She will be very good. I hope she does (succeed).”</p>, <p>Meghan detailed why she didn’t like Trump in a 2016 interview on US talk show, ""The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore."" She said: “It’s really the moment I go. We film 'Suits' in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada.</p>, <p>“Yes, of course, Trump is divisive, think about female voters alone, right?"" she said. “I think it was in 2012 the Republican Party lost the female vote by 12 points.""</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-father-lifetime-harry-meghan-becoming-royal"" target=""_blank"">MEGHAN MARKLE'S FATHER SLAMS LIFETIME'S 'HARRY &amp; MEGHAN: BECOMING ROYAL' AS 'DUMB FICTION'</a></strong></p>, <p>“That is a huge number and with as misogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that is a huge chunk of it.”</p>, <p>She added: “You’re not just voting for a woman if it’s Hillary (Clinton). Yes, you’re voting because she’s a woman, but certainly, because Trump has made it easy to see that you don’t really want that kind of world that he’s painting.”</p>, <p>Trump, who will be joined on his trip by <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/who/melania-trump/"">First Lady Melania</a>, 49, is also ready to talk environmental issues with Charles over tea next week.</p>, <p>The Prince is expected to tackle the President on his controversial decision to pull America out of the Paris <a href=""https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/climate-change-environment/"">climate change</a> agreement last year.</p>, <p>Trump told The Sun of the encounter: “I have met Charles before. I like Charles. I think that’s very good. We will be talking. I can say we have among the cleanest climate in the world right now.""</p>, <p>“Our air and water are doing very well. We hope other countries can do so well. You know, it is a big atmosphere and frankly if one country is going to be bad and other countries going to be good, the country that is good gets penalized.

The President said: “I think my children will be meeting them. It would be nice.”</p>, <p>He explained: “I am bringing some of the family. They are going to be there and we will be greatly honored by the trip. It will be great seeing the Queen for the second time.""</p>, <p>“We had a very good talk the first one.

</p>, <p>Government mandates are problematic. Transparency as a concept is beneficial. When private-sector organizations have been able to pull back the curtain on insurers' and providers' prices, they've unleashed competitive forces that have yielded significant savings for them — and for the rest of the health care system.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-secretary-azar-drug-makers-prices""><strong>HHS SECRETARY AZAR: DRUG MAKERS MUST START LISTING PRICES IN TV COMMERCIALS</strong></a></p>, <p>Hospitals are often reluctant to make their prices public because they don't want to — or can't — compete against lower-cost providers, like retail health or urgent care clinics.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Americans are smart shoppers. But in the health care market, they typically don't have access to the pricing information they'd need to be savvy consumers.</p>, <p>Such clinics aren't perfect substitutes for emergency rooms. But the clinics, which typically publish their prices on something akin to a restaurant menu, can deliver care for many common illnesses at significantly lower cost.</p>, <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that the average ""low-severity emergency room visit"" cost more than $400 out-of-pocket. That same visit was just $37 at a retail clinic.</p>, <p>A paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research looked at all emergency room visits in New Jersey between 2006 and 2014 — and discovered that people living close to a retail clinic were up to 12.3 percent less likely to visit the ER. The authors concluded that the state's health care system would realize $70 million in savings a year from reduced ER usage if retail clinics were more readily available.</p>, <p>Price transparency also helps employers — who provide health coverage to half the country — rein in health spending.</p>, <p>Take what the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers 1.3 million current and retired state employees and their families, has done to try to strike a harder bargain with health care providers.</p>, <p>CalPERS identified 41 hospitals across the state that were able to provide quality knee and hip replacement procedures for $30,000. Patients could opt to get care at facilities that charged more than that price, but they'd have to pay the difference out of pocket.</p>, <p>Previously, prices for knee and hip replacements had varied widely. Some hospitals charged as much as $100,000.</p>, <p>The CalPERS program prompted beneficiaries to flock to lower-cost hospitals, increasing their market share by 28 percent. Other hospitals began lowering their prices in response, to try to attract more business. Prices for knee and hip replacements fell by more than 20 percent over two years, saving CalPERS around $6 million.</p>, <p>Grocer Safeway has implemented a similar program for lab services that's yielded savings of between 10 percent and 32 percent, depending on the test.</p>, <p>Price transparency can also save patients themselves a great deal of money. Patients tend to choose the most affordable option for care when they're given relevant information.</p>, <p>Consider prescription drugs. According to the Association for Accessible Medicines, when patients have a choice between branded and generic medicines, they choose the cheaper generic 97 percent of the time.</p>, <p>Or take diagnostics. In 2007, the state of New Hampshire launched a website where patients could compare cost and quality for various procedures. The ability to access price information saved patients around $8 million on X-rays, CT scans and MRI scans over five years, according to a University of Michigan study.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Transparency could even save patients money indirectly. A study published by the journal Health Affairs found that yearly health spending was about $700 lower for patients who chose a ""low-price"" physician, compared to those who chose high-price physicians. The savings were due to the fact that low-price physicians tended to order less expensive tests and scans.</p>, <p>Americans are smart shoppers. But in the health care market, they typically don't have access to the pricing information they'd need to be savvy consumers. It shouldn't take a presidential directive to get them that information, which would do wonders to reduce health costs in this country.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/sally-pipes""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SALLY PIPES</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

But soon he will be on the road again for some statecraft in <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom"" target=""_blank"">Britain</a> and a historic visit to the Normandy beachheads of World War II.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The last time President Trump traveled to London the reception was noticeably chilly. The mayor was a vociferous Never-Trumper. No warmth emanated from Prime Minister Theresa May. And, a giant orange-haired <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-baby-blimp-gets-ok-to-fly-over-london-during-trumps-visit"" target=""_blank"">baby balloon</a> shadowed the president’s every appearance.</p>, <p>Not much has changed since then. The mayor remains in office -- and still in need of anger management classes. May is still in No. 10 Downing Street, though she will officially <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-pm-theresa-may-announces-resignation-amid-fury-over-brexit-handling"" target=""_blank"">step down</a> not long after Air Force One goes wheels up. And protest organizers have confirmed that the 20-foot Trump baby blimp will be back on the scene.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-prince-harry-queen-elizabeth-donald-trump-state-visit"" target=""_blank"">MEGHAN MARKLE TO SKIP LUNCH WITH PRINCE HARRY, DONALD TRUMP AND QUEEN ELIZABETH DURING STATE VISIT</a></strong></p>, <p>But none of that really matters. Anti-Trump histrionics across the pond are not much different than they are here, and public opinion is unlikely to shift, even if he gets to take tea with the queen and hang with the royal family.</p>, <p>If there’s a discernible absence of cordiality ... so what?</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">This trip is not for the pomp and circumstance. There are substantive items on the president’s agenda -- items that could significantly affect the future of the transatlantic community.</p>, <p>Topping the list is, of course, is <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe/brexit"" target=""_blank"">Brexit</a>. Trump is famously pro-Brexit, and by the time Trump lands in London, the Conservative party will be well on its way to picking a new leader -- one who will be committed to leading the U.K. out of the European Union.</p>, <p>Right now, the deadline for Brexit is October. Expect the new leader to commit to that. Don’t be surprised if, in the end, the government rejects the EU’s last-offered conditions for leaving and opts for the so-called “hard Brexit” -- i.e., just up and leaves.</p>, <p>Trump’s No. 1 job is to deliver the message, “Don’t worry. Be happy.” Britain will thrive after Brexit, and post-Brexit Britain’s “special relationship” with the U.S. will be as special as ever.</p>, <p>To assure the Brits that this will be the case, Trump should reaffirm his unshakable commitment to speedily conclude a U.S.-U.K. free trade agreement as soon as Britain is free of the EU while signaling to Congress his desire to pass enabling legislation as quickly as possible.</p>, <p>Job No. 2 should be to start revitalizing what has made the U.S.-U.K. relationship so special: our joint commitment to transatlantic security that spanned two world wars, a Cold War, and lots of messy stuff in between and after.</p>, <p>Trump and the new conservative leadership in London will need to work as a team. The NATO summit coming up in London at the end of the year will mark the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-chief-plays-down-rows-as-allies-mark-70th-anniversary"" target=""_blank"">alliance’s 70th anniversary.</a></p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The U.S. and Britain must work in tandem, pressing others in the alliance to better prepare for future challenges and sustain the momentum for NATO enlargement.</p>, <p>As my colleague, Nile Gardiner, advises: “The President should underscore his administration’s unyielding and steadfast commitment to NATO while urging all NATO allies to follow the lead set by the U.S. and U.K. in meeting their defense spending commitments.”</p>, <p>The U.S. and Britain must also lead the transatlantic community in responding to the destabilizing rise of <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china"" target=""_blank"">China</a>. European views on how to deal with Beijing’s advances -- from the Belt and Road Initiative to Huawei’s 5G technology -- are a mess. Even the British are equivocal.</p>, <p>On the one hand, they acknowledge the danger of allowing Chinese intrusion into their national telecom systems. On the other, the government has concluded it can accept the risk of incorporating Huawei technology into “non-critical” parts of the network -- a “solution” that will likely fail to provide the level of security necessary to accommodate continued intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>, <p>Trump needs to reboot this conversation with the Conservative party leadership. The U.S. and the U.K. need to reach a common assessment of the threat and then lead the larger European community to forge a consensus on the matter.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>That leaves one more agenda item: Iran. Here, the U.S. needs more support from the U.K. in convincing our transatlantic partners to move on from the Iran Deal and adopt a serious consensus strategy for managing Iran’s dangerous and destabilizing behavior.</p>, <p>It’s a lot to accomplish in one three-day visit, but if there is any room on the calendar after all these things are hashed out, then, by all means, make time for tea.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Meanwhile, the median household income in the United States is $59,039.

That can easily amount to $300. If it is out of town, hold your horses. By adding in travel and accommodation costs, you can easily be up to $700.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">While millennials can’t afford to buy homes, pay off student loans or, heaven forbid, have an emergency fund, they are spending overwhelming amounts on their friends’ weddings.</p>, <p>If you are in the wedding, just throw your wallet in the toilet and flush.

Elite or not, people are having destination weddings in Hawaii, Europe and sun-drenched, romantic islands in the Caribbean.</p>, <p>The average bridal party member now spends upwards of $1,500 simply for the privilege of being in their friend’s wedding.</p>, <p>Let me tell you a story. I was asked to be in the wedding of a good friend. (If you’re reading this, you are the exception and I had a blast.) I was completely honored and truly excited to do it. I went to the bachelorette party in Nashville. We all had to take Friday off from work, we stayed at an Airbnb, had two dinners, one daytime activity, and one night out. The total cost per person (including travel) was $1,000. Add in the actual wedding, and the shower, and I spent over $2,000.</p>, <p>See ya later, savings account.</p>, <p>Now, yes, I can already hear not only the readers of this column, but my own father, berating me for doing this, but really, what am I supposed to do? Tell my dear friend no? Not be a part of the wedding party, the bachelorette, and not witness the happiest of moments for my dear friend? Of course, I have to do it. I would do it again. But I shouldn’t have to.</p>, <p>As a $72 billion-per-year industry, the wedding gurus have us wrapped around their little ring finger. They’re having us spend exorbitant amounts on cocktail napkins, and they’re dragging the wedding party and guests right along with the bride- or groom-zilla(s).</p>, <p>I forgot to mention that the divorce industry is worth about $50 billion annually.

</p>, <p>The San Diego hospital where she was born said Saybie is believed to be the world’s smallest surviving newborn, according to the <a href=""https://webapps1.healthcare.uiowa.edu/TiniestBabies/index.aspx"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">Tiniest Babies Registry</a> kept by the University of Iowa.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/san-diego-hospital-announces-birth-of-worlds-tiniest-surviving-baby"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">SAN DIEGO HOSPITAL ANNOUNCES BIRTH OF WORLD’S TINIEST SURVIVING BABY</a></strong></p>, <p>I and other pro-life Americans noted on <u><a href=""https://twitter.com/PYNance"" style=""color: blue;"">Twitter</a></u> and other platforms that Saybie is living proof that science is on the side of the pro-life cause. Her very survival must raise questions for our nation regarding current law on abortion.</p>, <p>The late Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun famously said regarding the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court that legalized abortion nationwide: ""If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment.""</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Clearly, sweet Saybie was not just a clump of cells, nor was she ever “a part of the mother’s body.” Saybie was and is a distinct and precious human being with intrinsic value.</p>, <p>And of course, we are there now. Sonograms – 3-D, 4-D and HD – have settled the question of when life begins. At conception, a child has his or her own DNA separate and apart from the mother. We can see the baby’s beating heart as early as 18 days. At 30 days the developing little boy or girl has a nervous system. </p>, <p>At 12 weeks the child has fingernails. At 20 weeks, the baby has all the major organs we have, along with toenails and eyebrows. The child can sleep, can hear, can respond to the mother’s voice and can feel pain. </p>, <p>Clearly, sweet Saybie was not just a clump of cells, nor was she ever “a part of the mother’s body.” Saybie was and is a distinct and precious human being with intrinsic value. And now she has the opportunity to grow up and hopefully live a full life for many decades to come. </p>, <p>Reports say that doctors performed an emergency cesarean section because Saybie’s mother’s life was in danger; yet, precious Saybie and her mother survived. </p>, <p>Sadly, <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""http://bit.ly/2Ietkz7"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">31</a></u> states currently allow an abortionist to take the life of other babies at the same stage in development as Saybie. Why do the lives of their children not matter?  </p>, <p>According to abortion advocates, life depends upon the state of mind of the mother – whether the child is “wanted.” That’s a nonsensical argument refuted by science. </p>, <p>Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry make billions of dollars each year from scared mothers and dead babies. We are at a tipping point in our nation in which the facts can no longer be denied. Roe v. Wade is no longer in line with either science or public opinion. </p>, <p>People of conscience refuse to ignore the human right of a living human being to not be dismembered and discarded by a utilitarian society that finds the baby inconvenient. </p>, <p>More and more Americans agree and are overwhelmingly <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://www.kofc.org/un/en/resources/communications/american-attitudes-abortion-knights-of-columbus-marist-poll-slides.pdf"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">rejecting</a></u> the radical abortion extremism we have seen in states like Virginia and New York. </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Recent pro-life legislation in states like Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana is partly a response to the left’s rejection of truth.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Is this why Democrats are fired up about impeachment? American Conservative Union president Matt Schlapp reacts.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Ever since humanity identified the concept of a “future,” people have been trying to determine how to predict it: palms, winds, hexagrams, shamans, oracles … every culture has sought to identify the best way to foretell events.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">In recent weeks, attention has focused on several models that seem to have worked in the past and that predict the outcome of the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election"">2020 presidential election</a>. The models’ designers claim that they can be more accurate than using more commonly accepted voter polls to assess whether President Trump will win re-election. </p>, <p>The Fair Model, designed by Yale University Professor Jay Fair, uses a combination of economic growth, the power of incumbency and the voter tendency favoring change to estimate the popular vote share of the incumbent party. It got a boost from <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/opinion/trumps-formidable-2020-tailwind.html"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">The New York Times</a> recently, which pointed out that the model accurately predicted Trump would win in 2016, and that it predicts him getting re-elected in 2020.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-fox-news-town-hall-last-standing""><strong>STRUGGLING IN POLLS, KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND HOPES FOX NEWS TOWN HALL CAN HELP HER 'BE AMONG THE LAST STANDING'</strong></a></p>, <p>The Keys to the White House Model – developed by American University Professor Alan Lichtman and Russian scientist Vladimir Keilis-Borok – uses even more factors, including the strength of the incumbent party, party unity, apparent scandals, social unrest, and charisma of the candidates. It also looks at the success of policy changes by the incumbent and economic strength to predict who will win.</p>, <p>Both models currently forecast that Trump will easily win re-election. And several other models, including ones that focus on the Electoral College, also suggest a second Trump term. </p>, <p>At the same time, recent polls suggest that over half the electorate would vote against Trump, with his job approval rating in the mid-40 percent range.</p>, <p>The most recent Fox News poll showed several potential Democratic nominees with solid leads over Trump, with former Vice President Joe Biden beating the president 49 percent to 38 percent.</p>, <p>Who deserves our faith? The econometric and incumbency modeling shamans? Or the polling oracles? You need both to understand what’s going on politically as we head toward the 2020 elections.</p>, <p>I’d argue the models are correct to conclude that the state of the economy and the strength of incumbency have been key factors in affecting how people think (and therefore vote).</p>, <p>But while the models have worked in the past, they’ve not done as good a job in predicting the vote for Trump. Indeed, both the models mentioned suggested Trump would win the popular vote in 2016 – but he lost by 2 points.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Who deserves our faith? The econometric and incumbency modeling shamans? Or the polling oracles? You need both to understand what’s going on politically as we head toward the 2020 elections.</p>, <p>Still, the polls are right that Trump remains vastly less popular than a president ought to be under current conditions.</p>, <p>The American economy is on a tear right now, and we’re about to enter the longest economic expansion in history. That is an ideal environment for an incumbent. </p>, <p>If voters were faced with the choice of an unnamed Republican incumbent versus any Democratic challenger under current conditions, voters would clearly opt for the incumbent by a wide popular vote and Electoral College margins.</p>, <p>But an unnamed Republican incumbent will not be on the ballot next year. Trump will be.</p>, <p>Trump’s persona takes attention away from the successes of Trump’s administration. In fact, Trump is such a powerful presence that people wind up considering not should we re-elect Current Policies (I’d bet we would), but should we sign up for another four years of The Trump Show?</p>, <p>The polls suggest the public is looking for a different show. </p>, <p>So in the coming months, I’d look at both the models and the polls. </p>, <p>Should Trump submerge his personality to enable the public to focus on the success of his policies, one should expect that the models will turn out to be more accurate. But if the president’s personality remains in the center ring of the political circus, I’d focus primarily on betting with the polls. </p>, <p>In reading polls, it’s important to look underneath the numbers. Too often, folks focus on the difference between the main candidates, and each candidate’s actual number. </p>, <p>In 2016, many people focused on how Hillary Clinton was ahead of Trump in many key states in the Midwest, and therefore was likely to win. But in those states where she was leading, she was actually sitting in the mid-40s, while Trump was in the low 40s. </p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>There were a large number of undecided voters. When folks just looked at the difference, they were expecting the undecideds to split evenly among Trump and Clinton. But they didn’t. They went disproportionately to Trump, enabling him to eke out a victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and thus move into the White House.</p>, <p>If the polls continue to show the Democrat with close to or over 50 percent of the vote, then I’d expect the Dems to be able to win. Should the Democrat hover in the mid-40s – with a large undecided vote – then it’s very possible Trump will be in a position to win over a large chunk of the undecided voters and get another four years in the White House.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/arnon-mishkin"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ARNON MISHKIN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>At issue is Mueller’s decision to punt on the question of whether President Trump should be indicted for obstruction of justice. In his startling remarks, Mueller sought to justify himself by citing instruction from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The longstanding OLC opinion, an outgrowth of Nixon- and Clinton-era scandals, holds that a sitting president may not be indicted. The two press offices were struggling to reconcile (a) Mueller’s pointed reliance on this OLC guidance at the presser with (b) his prior disclaimers of such reliance.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>According to Attorney General William Barr, in a meeting over two weeks before Mueller submitted his final report, the special counsel emphatically denied that his refusal to render a prosecutorial judgment on obstruction hinged on the OLC guidance. Naturally, in their continuing quest to frame Barr as the most diabolical villain since Lex Luthor, the media-Democrat complex insisted that the AG must be lying.</p>, <p>This is what derangement will do to you. I do not think Mueller’s contradictory assertions are that hard to figure out. But if you were inclined to blame sleight of hand, the culprit would be Mueller. You’ll notice that when we finally heard from him on Wednesday, he lauded Barr’s good faith, never claiming that the AG had misrepresented him. Moreover, the conversation between them on the OLC guidance was not a one-on-one affair. There were other people in the room when Mueller denied that the OLC guidance was his rationale for abdicating.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-investigation-was-always-impeachment-probe/"">CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</a></strong></p>, <p><a href=""http://CLICK%20HERE%20TO%20GET%20THE%20FOX%20NEWS%20APP""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

I can tell you before President Trump gave his State of the Union, Fox News talked about infanticide.""</p>, <p>""Infanticide doesn't exist,"" she said, at which point <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/shows/fox-news-sunday"" target=""_blank"">""Fox News Sunday""</a> host <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/w/chris-wallace"" target=""_blank"">and town hall moderator Chris Wallace</a> cut her off.</p>, <p>""Senator, I just want to say, we've brought you here for an hour,"" Wallace said. ""We've treated you very fairly. I understand that maybe to make your credentials with the Democrats who are not appearing on Fox News you want to attack us. I'm not sure it's frankly very polite when we've invited you to be here.""</p>, <p>Gillibrand, who is polling at around one percent according to most national and early voting state polls, has yet to secure the 65,000 individual donor campaign contributions necessary to qualify her for the late June and July primary debates and hoped to use her platform on Fox to bolster support.</p>, <p>""I'll do it in a polite way,"" Gillibrand countered.</p>, <p>“Instead of talking about Fox News why don’t you answer Susan’s question,” Wallace said redirecting the senator to her stance on late-term abortions.</p>, <p>Gillibrand, a fervent supporter of abortion rights, has previously vowed to only nominate federal court judges who support Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion across the nation. She repeated that position during Sunday night's event at the University of Dubuque.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gillibrand-hoping-to-revive-struggling-presidential-bid-takes-stage-at-fox-news-town-hall"" target=""_blank""><strong>GILLIBRAND LIGHTS INTO NRA AS 'WORST ORGANIZATION IN THIS COUNTRY' AT FOX NEWS TOWN HALL</strong></a></p>, <p>""Does that mean that you're okay with other presidents having their own litmus tests?"" Wallace asked her. ""Maybe a pro-life president might say 'I'll only appoint people who will overturn Roe v Wade.' Because the tradition in this country has been [the] independence of the judiciary and the idea that a judge, once appointed, will judge each case on its merits and not on the basis of a promise made, a political promise to get that position.""</p>, <p>""I think it's changed. That's the way it used to be before President Trump,"" Gillibrand responded. ""President Trump said he would only appoint judges that would overturn Roe v.

""The rules have changed.""</p>, <p>Gillibrand also accused Republicans of creating a ""false narrative"" that doctors allow healthy babies to die after they are born in order to ease the passage of the “Born-Alive Abortion Survivors” bill, legislation that would make it a felony for a doctor to harm or neglect a baby who survives an attempted abortion.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Gillibrand went on to say that President Trump ""emboldened legislatures in over 30 states to begin to criminalize"" a woman's decision to have an abortion, state laws that have been challenged in courts across the nation because of their direct conflict with the precedent set by the Constitution.</p>, <p>The senator slammed a member of her own party, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/louisianas-governor-a-democrat-signs-heartbeat-abortion-bill-into-law"" target=""_blank"">Louisiana Gov.

Wade, so it is forever the law of the land"" when asked to clarify whether she supported late-term abortions.</p>, <p>She also suggested ""all-male"" legislators were behind the passage of a slew of pro-life ""heartbeat"" laws that have passed recently in southern states. However, Alabama's female governor, Kay Ivey, enacted the state's restrictive anti-abortion law in May, while the Democratic representative behind a similar bill in Louisiana is <a href=""http://Democratic%20Rep.%20Katrina%20Jackson"" target=""_blank"">an African-American woman</a>. Several other women legislators also supported the bills.</p>, <p>At one point, Gillibrand attempted to attack <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-to-vote-on-born-alive-bill-to-protect-infants-who-survive-a-failed-abortion"" target=""_blank"">Fox News' coverage of Democrats' efforts to block anti-infanticide legislation</a>, in the wake of Virginia Democrat Gov.

Kirsten Gillibrand answers audience questions with moderator Chris Wallace in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>, <p>Wallace then probed Gillibrand's Dec. 2018 tweet stating that ""Our future is: Female, Intersectional, Powered by our belief in one another."" The tweet attracted mockery in conservative circles, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio responding; ""Our future is: AMERICAN. An identity based not on gender, race, ethnicity or religion. But on the powerful truth that all people are created equal with a God-given right to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness.""</p>, <p>""Really good questions, Chris,"" Gillibrand responded when asked what she meant by her remarks. ""What I mean by 'our future is female' is that we want more women's voices heard. I was so inspired by the 2018 election. ... Our first two Muslim-American women [elected to Congress].""</p>, <p>""What about men?"" Wallace asked.</p>, <p>""They're already there. Do you not know?"" Gillibrand replied, to applause. ""It's not meant to be exclusionary, it's meant to be inclusive.""</p>, <p>""That's very reassuring,"" Wallace said.</p>, <p>Gillibrand continued: ""Intersectional to me, means when you're discriminated against in more than one way."" She offered the example of a black, homosexual woman who is discriminated against because she is black, a woman, and gay.</p>, <p>At the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco this weekend, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper <a href=""https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1134948783127576576"" target=""_blank"">elicited loud boos from attendees in a viral video moment</a> when he declared ""socialism is not the answer"" to enacting progressive policies and beating Trump. Hickenlooper quickly highlighted the negative reaction on his Twitter account: ""I know this message won't be popular with everyone in our party. But the stakes are too high. We cannot hand this election to Donald Trump.""</p>, <p>Hickenlooper also declared that ""we shouldn't try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from 150 million Americans,"" and said addressing climate change shouldn't necessitate ""guaranteeing every American a government job."" Both statements also drew boos.</p>, <p>Asked where she stood on the issue, Gillibrand refused to wholeheartedly endorse either capitalism or socialism.</p>, <p>""There's a lot of confusion,"" Gillibrand said. ""There's a big difference between capitalism and greed. We know what healthy capitalism looks like. ... Over the last few decades, we've seen income inequality grow because we care more today about shareholders than we do about workers.""</p>, <p>Gillibrand similarly toed both sides of the line on immigration, saying she ""fully support[s] border security."" But she also condemned President Trump's aggressive illegal immigration enforcement efforts, calling them ""inhumane."" She vowed a humane asylum process, more border security funding, and ""comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship"" -- a lofty legislative goal that has stalled several times in recent years.</p>, <p>The senator also implied the deaths of several children in Border Patrol custody were the fault of the Trump administration, without evidence. Advocates have long questioned the Border Patrol's ability to care for the thousands of parents and children in its custody, but there have been no indications that maltreatment in Border Patrol custody caused the deaths.</p>, <p>Since jumping into the race in January, Gillibrand has been hovering right around one percent – or less – in most national and early voting state polls. She’s watched one-time extreme long-shots like Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang move ahead of her in the polls.</p>, <p>Asked how she could compete with frontrunner Joe Biden, Gillibrand responded, ""This is a marathon, not a sprint ... It's still early, I'm still introducing myself to the voters.""</p>, <p>Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand answers audience questions with moderator Chris Wallace in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>, <p>In a personal moment, Gillibrand defended her decision to call for former Minnesota Democrat Sen.

She described a conversation she had with her son at the time.</p>, <p>""Theo, it's not okay to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her consent. ... It's not OK for Al Franken, and it's not OK for you.""</p>, <p>Key Democrat donors reportedly swore off Gillibrand after the episode, saying she was trying to advance her own career at the expense of the party.

What better way to counter President Trump’s division than to inspire and enable young people to do good with their lives?</p>, <p>Here’s how my plan would work: </p>, <p>Individuals who commit to serve one year of public service would be awarded tax-free financial assistance to attend two years of public or community college tuition-free, and those who serve two years would be able to attend four years free.</p>, <p>Those public servants who don’t want to attend a public college or who already have received an undergraduate degree can use the equivalent tax-free financial assistance towards the cost of a private education, to get a graduate degree, to pay down existing student debt, to participate in an accredited job-training program, to start a business, or to purchase a home. </p>, <p>Beyond the financial benefit, these public servants would be filling critically needed roles in our communities. These include special education aides and teaching assistants, home health aides and nurses for nonprofit providers, social workers, public defenders and first responders, as well as certain nonprofit work and jobs in federal, state, local and tribal governments.</p>, <p>My plan would help graduates by improving the current federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to assist qualified public servants with any debt beyond the new financial award. </p>, <p>This plan would also prioritize lifting up public service leaders in communities that have been left behind.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are reportedly battling for an endorsement from the progressive freshman lawmaker.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The most important political campaign this year that you’ve probably never heard of is the Democratic primary for district attorney in the<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york""> New York City</a> borough of Queens. Seven mostly unknown candidates will face off June 25.   </p>, <p class=""speakable"">Unless you live in Queens, why should you care?</p>, <p>Because the outcome of this obscure primary – to fill a vacancy created by the death of Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in March – will tell us a lot about the race for the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election"">2020 Democratic presidential nomination. </a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-endorses-queens-candidate-testing-her-political-influence-on-new-yorkers""><strong>AOC ENDORSES QUEENS CANDIDATE, TESTING HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE ON NEW YORKERS</strong></a></p>, <p>The outcome will indicate whether Democratic voters support candidates on the moderate-left, the far-left, or the socialist far-out extreme-left.</p>, <p>In fact, I believe that no poll, televised town hall, presidential tweet or anything else will be as predictive as the primary in Queens of who will become the Democratic nominee for president next year. </p>, <p>Queens is where Amazon nearly put in its second headquarters, until some New York politicians – most notably self-proclaimed democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – made the giant company unwelcome and prompted it to cancel its plans.</p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez – an extreme-left radical who bills herself as the friend of working men and women – said her opposition to “corporate greed” and <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/doug-schoen-amazons-cancellation-of-a-move-to-nyc-is-bad-news-and-could-hurt-far-left-dems-at-polls"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">“worker exploitation”</a></u> led her to help kill Amazon’s plan to create between 25,000 and 40,000 jobs paying salaries averaging more than $150,000 in her district. </p>, <p>Apparently, being unemployed and collecting government benefits is better than being an exploited worker earning a mere $150,000 salary in the congresswoman’s view. Workers of the world unite – and stop being workers, I guess.</p>, <p>The presence of firebrand Ocasio-Cortez – a media magnet for her radical views – is what makes this sleepy district attorney race so incredibly important.</p>, <p>The leading candidate in the Democratic primary is Melinda Katz, currently the borough president of Queens. She is a former corporate lawyer who served as a member of the New York state Assembly and the New York City Council and has a strong record of legislative accomplishments.</p>, <p>Katz, 53, was once called ""one of the one hundred up-and-coming young leaders for the 21st Century"" by the New York Daily News. Now she has the endorsement many groups representing a broad range of interests, including many ethnic groups and top labor unions.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The presence of firebrand Ocasio-Cortez – a media magnet for her radical views – is what makes this sleepy district attorney race so incredibly important.</p>, <p>Sounds like a dream candidate, right? Not so fast. </p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez – who apparently wants to be the political kingmaker and queen-maker of Queens and far beyond – has endorsed one of Katz’s opponents, Tiffany Cabán, who has support from the extreme left. Her backers include the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party. </p>, <p>Cabán is a 31-year-old a public defender and has never run for political office, like Ocasio-Cortez prior to 2018. Cabán needs all the help she can get, because she raised less than $1,000 for her campaign in the first quarter of this year. </p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez says that Cabán is “a champion who will fight to realign our priorities towards equal treatment under the law.” </p>, <p>And now Cabán is following the Ocasio-Cortez political game plan. The candidate is implementing the same strategies that helped Ocasio-Cortez unseat longtime Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in the party’s primary last year.</p>, <p>So the Queens race is an under-the-radar test of Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to defeat establishment Democrats like Crowley in primaries and move the party as far left as she possibly can.</p>, <p>The Intercept, progressive website, describes Katz as if she were a political hack, calling her “a career politician with no courtroom experience who’s run for at least six offices throughout New York” with “machine backing and questionable past positions on issues from the death penalty to cash bail.”</p>, <p>But that doesn’t sound like who Melinda Katz really is. And just to be clear: I don’t work for Katz’s campaign, haven’t contributed to it, and frankly had never heard of her until I read the piece in The Intercept. I can’t even vote in Queens – my family moved out of the borough when I was a 5-year-old. </p>, <p>Ocasio Cortez’s game plan last year was to use social media (free) and ring enough doorbells (also free) to garner enough support to sneak up on a well-entrenched, well-funded incumbent and defeat him.</p>, <p>The stealth strategy worked for Ocasio-Cortez and now she is perhaps the most recognizable face (and one of the most followed on Twitter) in Washington after President Trump.</p>, <p>So if the grassroots and social media strategy boosts Cabán past Katz (and the other five candidates in the primary) you can consider what happens in this race a demonstration of the power of today’s progressive movement. And a demonstration of Ocasio-Cortez’s power as well.</p>, <p>Social media and campaigning on the street, block by block, are now powerful tools in politics. Having the most money, the most endorsements, or even the most coverage in traditional news media is no longer enough to defeat your opponents in a campaign</p>, <p>This is what used to be called “retail politics,” as opposed to what usually goes on today, which could be described as “whoever has the biggest media budget wins.”</p>, <p>So you can’t fault Cabán, Ocasio-Cortez and their grassroots supporters for doing what candidates are supposed to do: ring doorbells, kiss babies and get out the vote.</p>, <p>Melinda Katz is Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Mayor Pete, all rolled into one: an accomplished politician with an outstanding record of public service.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>But none of that will matter if Cabán, who has done exactly nothing in electoral politics, wins.</p>, <p>The takeaway will be this: what happens in Queens will happen all over the country in local and statewide elections. You’ve been warned.</p>, <p>And if Cabán, defeats Katz I’m putting my money on democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to be the Democratic nominee for president. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/michael-levin"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL LEVIN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Admissions officers should weigh more heavily the potential, moxie, obstacles overcome and the socioeconomic status of student applicants. They should move away from admitting applicants based mostly on their parents’ alumni status or donations.</p>, <p>Here are four ways we can ensure our federal investment in education creates a fairer country, a stronger economy and more skilled workforce:</p>, <p>Every college receiving federal funds must have transparent admission policies and reserve a big portion of incoming slots for students who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Likewise, a sizable portion of athletic and academic scholarships should go to students from lower socioeconomic families. Legacy slots should be reduced or eliminated.</p>, <p>Student loans should have interest rates correlating with the need in the workforce for the resulting degree, with lower interest rates for in-demand degrees. This would discourage students from entering careers for which there are few jobs.</p>, <p>Colleges should guarantee a portion of loan repayments to the federal government.

But when it comes to taking care of its own, it fails miserably. </p>, <p class=""speakable"">Whether it is homelessness, shoddy roads, overcrowded prisons, uncontrolled wildfires, horrendous traffic, or illegal immigrant crime, California has again and again demonstrated <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tammy-bruce-the-dystopian-nightmare-that-is-california-has-been-brought-to-you-by-democrats"">a failure </a>to provide the most basic government services – despite being the wealthiest and highest- taxed state in the U.S.</p>, <p>And now another problem threatens to make the others seem like minor inconveniences. There has been a typhus outbreak in Los Angeles as a result of the city’s failure to keep its streets and sidewalks clean.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/dr-drew-says-third-world-countries-would-be-insulted-to-be-compared-with-los-angeles""><strong>DR.  DREW SAYS  LA PUBLIC HEALTH  IN 'COMPLETE BREAKDOWN':  'NO CITY ON EARTH TOLERATES THIS'</strong></a></p>, <p>Los Angeles County officials said the outbreak was linked to overcrowding downtown of homeless people and generally unsanitary conditions. At least one employee at a city police station has contracted the disease. </p>, <p>In fact, city police stations are infested with vermin, including rats and fleas. According to a Los Angeles Times report, the LAPD’s downtown station is so unsanitary that the California Department of Industrial Relations has issued six violations against the police department.</p>, <p>This comes on the heels of a similar report of infestation at the Los Angeles City Hall last year. </p>, <p>The problem of trash, rodents and unsanitary conditions used to be relegated to homeless encampments in the city. And that remains no small problem. </p>, <p>According to the city’s Department of Public Works, there is a backlog on over 8,000 service calls for trash pickup around homeless encampments. There are reports that the garbage is also the result of illegal dumping by local restaurants and businesses seeking to avoid the city’s exorbitant new garbage and recycling fees. </p>, <p>Lest you think these conditions are unique to Los Angeles, San Francisco continues to struggle with its own problem of human feces on the streets. The number of reports of unwelcome deposits of human waste has grown from about 5,000 in 2011 to more than 25,000 last year. </p>, <p>And in San Diego, a recent Hepatitis A outbreak linked to unsanitary living conditions among its homeless population infected over 600 people, resulting in 20 deaths. </p>, <p>Rather than tending to these most basic problems, California is spending billions of dollars building a bullet train modeled after those in France. And Los Angeles is spending millions of dollars building bike lanes modeled after those in Copenhagen. </p>, <p>But California is looking less and less like the European-style utopia it seeks to be, and more and more like a Central American country.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>The key leaders are absent.

I was asked to be in the wedding of a good friend. (If you’re reading this, you are the exception and I had a blast.) I was completely honored and truly excited to do it. I went to the bachelorette party in Nashville. We all had to take Friday off from work, we stayed at an Airbnb, had two dinners, one daytime activity, and one night out. The total cost per person (including travel) was $1,000. Add in the actual wedding, and the shower, and I spent over $2,000.</p>, <p>See ya later, savings account.</p>, <p>Now, yes, I can already hear not only the readers of this column, but my own father, berating me for doing this, but really, what am I supposed to do? Tell my dear friend no? Not be a part of the wedding party, the bachelorette, and not witness the happiest of moments for my dear friend? Of course, I have to do it. I would do it again.

They’re having us spend exorbitant amounts on cocktail napkins, and they’re dragging the wedding party and guests right along with the bride- or groom-zilla(s).</p>, <p>I forgot to mention that the divorce industry is worth about $50 billion annually.

President Trump says there is enough turmoil in Israel.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Israelis will go to the polls yet again Sept. 17 to elect a new parliament, after Prime Minister <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/benjamin-netanyahu"">Benjamin Netanyahu </a>suffered an enormous setback when he failed to put together a coalition and form a new government following weeks of talks after the last election April 9. </p>, <p class=""speakable"">The parliament, called the Knesset, voted to dissolve itself late Wednesday night and call new elections. This marked the first time since the creation of <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/israel"">modern-day Israel</a> in 1948 that the person tapped to become prime minister was unable to form a government.</p>, <p>Unlike in the U.S., where there are only two major political parties, Israel has a parliamentary government that requires the support of a majority of Knesset members from a coalition of small parties. That means one party needs the support of at least 61 members in the 120-member Knesset to govern the Jewish state. No single party has ever captured 61 Knesset seats on its own. </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-2nd-snap-election-parliament-dissolve""><strong>ISRAEL FACES 2ND SNAP ELECTION IN 2019 AS PARLIAMENT VOTES TO DISSOLVE ITSELF</strong></a></p>, <p>The collapse of Netanyahu’s coalition-building effort is a clear loss for the prime minister, his conservative Likud Party and really all of Israel, leaving the nation with a weak caretaker government in place. The only true winners are the foes of Israel. </p>, <p>Despite the April election that seemed to guarantee Netanyahu another term as prime minister, now neither the left nor the right can claim absolute victory.</p>, <p>Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p>Key questions now arise as we consider Israel’s fate.</p>, <p><strong>What happens to the Trump peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians?</strong></p>, <p>President Trump has been promising to unveil a still-undisclosed peace plan between Israel and the Palestinians since early in his administration, and asked his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to put the plan together. In fact, Kushner met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem Thursday to discuss the plan.</p>, <p>The peace plan, which deals primarily with economic and not political issues, was on life-support even before the dissolution of the Knesset. Palestinians are opposing it sight unseen to protest President Trump’s support of Israel, including his move of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and recognition of the city as Israel’s capital. Palestinians want to establish a capital in Jerusalem for their own state.</p>, <p>Now Netanyahu has no incentive to make big concessions to the Palestinians, for fear that could cost him votes in the September election. Even if he did make such concessions, Palestinians show no signs of being in the mood to make compromises on their ambitious goals.</p>, <p><strong>Can Netanyahu stay in office?</strong></p>, <p>While he remains in office until the September election, no one knows if Netanyahu will get the chance to try to form a new government by cobbling together another coalition. His Likud Party won 35 seats in the April election but was unable to get the support of an additional 26 Knesset members to form a government. </p>, <p>Another party could be asked by the president of Israel to form a coalition if it wins more seats than Likud in September or is believed to have a better chance of forming a governing coalition. </p>, <p>An anti-Netanyahu coalition gathered for a mass rally last week – including the Blue and White Party led by Benny Gantz, as well as the Labor Party, the Meretz Party, and even the Israeli Arab parties. But at this point it’s uncertain if this group of parties with differing agendas represents a real, credible and lasting alternative to Netanyahu that has the possibility of forming a coalition government.</p>, <p><strong>What is the impact of the religious divide among Israeli Jews?</strong></p>, <p>Israeli political parties are divided not just based on political ideology, but between Orthodox and other Jews. Orthodox parties have never won enough votes to form a government, but they can determine which larger party gets to govern my joining that party in a coalition.</p>, <p>Former Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman was expected to align his small ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu Party with Netanyahu’s Likud Party so Netanyahu could form a government after the April election. </p>, <p>But Lieberman’s refused to join Netanyahu’s government in a dispute over a law that would end the sweeping exemption of ultra-Orthodox men from the military draft. Lieberman – like many secular Israelis – wants the exemption ended. But Netanyahu refused to agree to that, because doing so would cost him the support of the religious parties he needs to form a majority coalition.</p>, <p>Now Netanyahu and members of the Likud Party are placing the blame for Likud’s failure to form a government squarely on Lieberman.</p>, <p>“Lieberman never intended to reach an agreement,” Netanyahu said following the collapse of his coalition-building effort. “He clearly wanted to shoot down this government and he is doing so because he reckons he will receive a few more votes” in a new election.</p>, <p>To be sure, it is not yet clear whether this is a short-term political tiff between Netanyahu and Lieberman will be papered over in a new election, or whether this will constitute a lasting separation by the ultranationalist Lieberman coalition that could jeopardize the religious coalition, and ultimately Netanyahu.</p>, <p>Similarly, it is important to consider whether this failure was about one issue that did not get resolved, or whether it is about the larger issue of whether Netanyahu has the support and the ability to bring together enough parties to control a Knesset majority of 61 seats.</p>, <p>This latest development also raises the question of what the makeup of the new Knesset will be after September. </p>, <p>High-profile parties such as the New Right Party led by Ayalet Shaked and Naftali Bennet just barely missed the threshold for Knesset representation in April. However, if they could capture more than the 3.25 percent of the vote needed for representation in the Knesset in the September election, the Israeli government would be much further to the right than ever before.</p>, <p><strong>Will Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges?</strong></p>, <p>As if trying to win more support in a new election so he can form a coalition government is not a big enough challenge, Netanyahu also faces the possibility of indictment in three corruption cases. Israel’s attorney general has set a hearing to make a final decision on charges for October, at which point a new government may or may not be formed.</p>, <p>After Israel’s elections in April, Netanyahu was poised to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister by far, and seemed unbeatable even in the face of corruption charges and fierce opposition. His grip on power has been truly remarkable, and the leverage he has had over all areas of life in Israel – ranging from security, to business, to the economy and the media – is unparalleled. </p>, <p>However, the question of whether Netanyahu can and will last in the face of these charges, a possible conviction, and a new election is now very legitimate.</p>, <p>Indeed, it is entirely possible that Netanyahu will be indicted either during, or more likely after, the second election campaign. His failure to form a government also impeded his plans to have the Knesset grant its members (including Netanyahu) immunity from prosecution while in office.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>Ultimately, it is clear that Israel is paralyzed and will remain in a state of unprecedented uncertainty until a new government is formed after the next election.</p>, <p>There are plenty of questions but few answers regarding the future of the nation’s politics and government.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/douglas-schoen"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUG SCHOEN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Pet ownership is highest in <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/wyoming"">Wyoming</a> (72 percent) and lowest in Rhode Island (45 percent). Horses, birds, fish, hamsters and other creatures round out the common array of household companions.</p>, <p>The subject of pets is a bit like the debate over Daylight Savings Time. Everybody has an opinion. Of course, there are dog people. And then there are cat people. Usually those who have either or both often can’t imagine life without one — or maybe two. More people have dogs than cats, and just fewer than 10 percent have both.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/snuffly-cat-forever-home-condition-sneeze""><strong>'SNUFFLY' CAT STRUGGLING TO FIND FOREVER HOME BECAUSE OF CONDITION THAT MAKES HIM SNEEZE EXCESSIVELY</strong></a></p>, <p>If you’re personally opposed to an animal inside your home, you probably have your reasons and there’s little anyone can say to change your mind.</p>, <p>But that doesn’t stop us zealots from trying.</p>, <p>As a child, I never knew life without a pet. With four older siblings, I was born into a family with a little beagle named Snoopy. At first, I wondered why Charles Schulz’s version slept on top of his doghouse while ours comfortably convalesced in the kitchen.</p>, <p>
      Snoopy
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Our Snoopy was less flamboyant than the comic strip character. He didn’t wear a pilgrim hat on Thanksgiving or play on our backyard baseball team. Sweet and mellowed by age, she liked to sit under the kitchen table and stare out at the hustle and bustle of our seven-person family. Fifty years later, you can still see the evidence — small gnaw marks on the table legs and bench.</p>, <p>On a chilly October day when I was seven, I remember my oldest brother Jim scooping Snoopy up in his arms and announcing he was taking her to the vet. Nobody told me, and I’m glad they didn’t, but she was in the final hours of her life. When he returned empty-handed from Dr. Sussman’s office, tears were streaming down his face. He broke the sad news. I retreated to our side porch and cried along with my sister.</p>, <p>Something seemed to be missing from our house that next week — no wagging tail greeting us after school or a dog begging for scraps beneath the table. A strange silence permeated each room.</p>, <p>So we were thrilled the next weekend when my dad announced plans for us to go to the North Shore Animal League to look for a new dog. We picked Daisy out of a large cardboard box, a small black and white shepherd mix puppy. We selected her because she had sort of selected us, jumping up in our direction while the others in the litter seemed content to lie quietly along the side.</p>, <p>
      Daisy as a puppy
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Daisy grew up to be a terrific family dog, the kind you remember and talk about at family reunions decades later. Every kid needs a friend to play with and when my neighborhood pals weren’t around, she was always available and eager to oblige. She loved to play fetch in the backyard and the first toss of the tennis ball was always as exciting to her as the last.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">I’m convinced pets are part of God’s perfect plan, a gift that keeps giving long after they fade from the scene though never from our memories.</p>, <p>Incredibly, Daisy was also empathetic and could sense emotion, particularly anxiety or sadness. When my mother received a call notifying her of our grandmother’s death, Daisy sat by her side the entire 30 minutes, her head lying gently in my mom’s lap.</p>, <p>Daisy was also tough. We were burglarized when I was in the 7th grade and the thief or thieves shoved the poor mutt down the basement stairs. We found her in a heap under a kitchen. Yet by the next day she was back running after balls and chasing squirrels.</p>, <p>
      Daisy wearing a hat
      <!-- --></p>, <p>
      Daisy in her prime
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Of all the many positive benefits to having a family pet, though, their seemingly eternal optimism and good cheer strikes me as the most endearing. They’re always happy to see you, are usually pretty easy to please, never talk back — and rarely hold a grudge. They keep you company, encourage you to exercise and are quick to make you laugh.</p>, <p>In fact, there are days when I might even agree with the late curmudgeonly CBS newsman Andy Rooney who once observed that the average dog is nicer than the average person.</p>, <p>At the same time, I’ve had people tell me they’d never get another dog or cat because of how painful it was to put their last one down.</p>, <p>I know what they’re talking about because I’ve been there several times, once late at night, holding in my arms the Great Dane who saved our son’s life. But he was old and paralyzed from a fall. I cried all the way home. But if you ask me, this might be one of the most important of all reasons why a child should have a pet. Learning to love and then let go and deal with loss is a critical part of growing up. You’re not doing a young person any favors by shielding them from every hurt or heartache.</p>, <p>In fact, Alfred Lord Tennyson’s oft-quoted poetic words, “Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all” takes on new meaning to a child who says goodbye to a favorite family pet.</p>, <p>Daisy lived almost 13 years and on the last day of her life, I took her for a drive down to the beach, just the two of us. We stopped for a bagel and ate it together looking out over the sand and rolling surf of Jones Beach’s Field 6.</p>, <p>It wasn’t lost on me that I was just a young boy when we brought her home and now I was all grown up myself, a young man with my own car, holding a dying dog with a gray muzzle — and knowing the awful task of putting her out of her misery lie ahead. We had grown up together, a boy and his dog, months and years of memories and now the time had come to say goodbye.</p>, <p>We buried Daisy in the backyard, beneath a towering maple tree in the area where she loved to play fetch. We planted daisies over the spot and each year the flowers bloomed bright, reviving and rekindling the memories all over again.</p>, <p>“Don’t focus on the sadness of losing her,” my mom had told me. “Be grateful for all the joy she brought us.”</p>, <p>I don’t think you ever forget the pet of your childhood, the kind companion who unconditionally accepted and loved you at the very time you were still gaining confidence and trying to figure out where you fit in.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>And because of that and for a million reasons more, I’m convinced pets are part of God’s perfect plan, a gift that keeps giving long after they fade from the scene though never from our memories.</p>, <p>So three cheers to all the pets who add color and happiness to our lives, allowing us to sing with gusto the familiar refrain, “All things bright and beautiful; All creatures great and small; All things wise and wonderful: The Lord made them all.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/paul-batura""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY PAUL BATURA</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Deroy Murdock says making health care prices more transparent is a great idea so patients can 'shop around.'</p>, <p class=""speakable""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump"">President Trump</a> is expected to issue an executive order soon that could require insurers and hospitals to disclose the prices they've negotiated for various services. He hopes such transparency will increase competition and drive down health spending.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/health-care"">health care</a> industry is less supportive. The nation's top health insurance lobby, for instance, claims the president's plan is ""bad transparency"" that could actually cause prices to go up.</p>, <p>Government mandates are problematic. Transparency as a concept is beneficial. When private-sector organizations have been able to pull back the curtain on insurers' and providers' prices, they've unleashed competitive forces that have yielded significant savings for them — and for the rest of the health care system.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hhs-secretary-azar-drug-makers-prices""><strong>HHS SECRETARY AZAR: DRUG MAKERS MUST START LISTING PRICES IN TV COMMERCIALS</strong></a></p>, <p>Hospitals are often reluctant to make their prices public because they don't want to — or can't — compete against lower-cost providers, like retail health or urgent care clinics.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Americans are smart shoppers. But in the health care market, they typically don't have access to the pricing information they'd need to be savvy consumers.</p>, <p>Such clinics aren't perfect substitutes for emergency rooms. But the clinics, which typically publish their prices on something akin to a restaurant menu, can deliver care for many common illnesses at significantly lower cost.</p>, <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that the average ""low-severity emergency room visit"" cost more than $400 out-of-pocket. That same visit was just $37 at a retail clinic.</p>, <p>A paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research looked at all emergency room visits in New Jersey between 2006 and 2014 — and discovered that people living close to a retail clinic were up to 12.3 percent less likely to visit the ER. The authors concluded that the state's health care system would realize $70 million in savings a year from reduced ER usage if retail clinics were more readily available.</p>, <p>Price transparency also helps employers — who provide health coverage to half the country — rein in health spending.</p>, <p>Take what the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which covers 1.3 million current and retired state employees and their families, has done to try to strike a harder bargain with health care providers.</p>, <p>CalPERS identified 41 hospitals across the state that were able to provide quality knee and hip replacement procedures for $30,000. Patients could opt to get care at facilities that charged more than that price, but they'd have to pay the difference out of pocket.</p>, <p>Previously, prices for knee and hip replacements had varied widely. Some hospitals charged as much as $100,000.</p>, <p>The CalPERS program prompted beneficiaries to flock to lower-cost hospitals, increasing their market share by 28 percent. Other hospitals began lowering their prices in response, to try to attract more business. Prices for knee and hip replacements fell by more than 20 percent over two years, saving CalPERS around $6 million.</p>, <p>Grocer Safeway has implemented a similar program for lab services that's yielded savings of between 10 percent and 32 percent, depending on the test.</p>, <p>Price transparency can also save patients themselves a great deal of money. Patients tend to choose the most affordable option for care when they're given relevant information.</p>, <p>Consider prescription drugs. According to the Association for Accessible Medicines, when patients have a choice between branded and generic medicines, they choose the cheaper generic 97 percent of the time.</p>, <p>Or take diagnostics. In 2007, the state of New Hampshire launched a website where patients could compare cost and quality for various procedures. The ability to access price information saved patients around $8 million on X-rays, CT scans and MRI scans over five years, according to a University of Michigan study.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Transparency could even save patients money indirectly. A study published by the journal Health Affairs found that yearly health spending was about $700 lower for patients who chose a ""low-price"" physician, compared to those who chose high-price physicians. The savings were due to the fact that low-price physicians tended to order less expensive tests and scans.</p>, <p>Americans are smart shoppers. But in the health care market, they typically don't have access to the pricing information they'd need to be savvy consumers. It shouldn't take a presidential directive to get them that information, which would do wonders to reduce health costs in this country.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/p/sally-pipes""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SALLY PIPES</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Mueller press conference shows he is no longer interested in being a neutral arbiter and has placed himself in the partisan arena.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Populism is about fighting a corrupt establishment. And boy did we see them in action last week. This was the week that <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Robert Mueller</a> put himself in the arena</p>, <p class=""speakable"">With his bizarre new doctrine of ""not not guilty,"" <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-russia-no-collusion-trump-barr-bret-baier"">he overturned the presumption of innocence</a>. Then, with his unsubtly coded call for the impeachment of President Trump, he revealed his real aim: Overturning the 2016 election.</p>, <p>Mueller was hired to be a neutral arbiter, to bring a clear conclusion that the country could unite behind. But on Wednesday, he ripped off the mask of neutrality and showed himself for what he is: A partisan in the fight between the populists and the establishment.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/steve-hilton"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.</strong></a></p>, <p>We shouldn't be surprised -- Mueller<em> is</em> the establishment. He's a swamp lawyer, as we told you months ago in our ""Swamp Watch"" episiode on the special counsel and his best buddy, James Comey last August.</p>, <p>Remember, Robert Mueller was previously director of the FBI. And James Comey was previously deputy attorney general. By an incredible coincidence, once Comey left that job to become the multi-million-dollar general counsel of defense giant Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin was awarded contract after contract, over a billion dollars' worth, by Robert Mueller's FBI.</p>, <p>And there's more, as we told you, last August:. I said the following:</p>, <p><em>""Robert Mueller's swampiness goes beyond awarding billion dollar contracts to his best friend's employer.. After leaving his post as FBI director, what did this modern-day saint, this paragon of ethics and integrity do? He cashed in, of course. Mueller went back to work for his old law and lobbying firm, now called Wilmer-Hale. And surprise surprise, his clients were directly related to his previous government work. One of them was Booz-Allen-Hamilton -- like Lockheed Martin, a giant surveillance contractor. Bloomberg has called them 'the world's most profitable spy agency.'""</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-next-revolution-with-steve-hilton/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>That's the establishment code: You protect each other. Always. And you take down any and every threat to your power. That's how to understand last week's extraordinary intervention by Mueller. It was the establishment's final stand against their mortal enemy - Trump, and the peasant's revolt he led in 2016.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice ...  President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>They tried to stop him getting elected by clearing Hillary Clinton. They tried to bring him down by manufacturing a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Russia collusion scandal</a>. And when all that failed, last week Robert Mueller played the obstruction card.</p>, <p>Strip away all the tortured legalese and intellectual incoherence, it all boiled down to one thing - Mueller saying, ""I can't prove he did it, but [wink] he did it."" He talked about ""another process,"" and with that weak, pathetic attempt to hide the explosive nature of what he was really saying, Mueller called on Congress to impeach the president.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Impeach him for what? He didn't plot with Putin to steal the election. Mueller found no evidence for that crazed establishment fantasy, despite two years of trying</p>, <p>The president didn't obstruct justice. Mueller found no evidence of that, either, as he himself admitted in a clarification put out later that same day. Mueller's claim that it was the regulation about not indicting a sitting president that stopped him recommending charges was a lie.</p>, <p>Let's be really clear about that: Robert Mueller -- yes, the straight-shooting man of integrity, Robert Mueller -- lied from the podium last Wednesday. He lied to cover up the fact that he didn't find evidence of obstruction to justify a criminal charge.</p>, <p>What did he he find? Stories about the president losing his temper. Of course he lost his temper! If a totally manufactured conspiracy theory about you being a traitor to your country and colluding with an enemy power derails your presidency for years, wouldn't you be annoyed about it? This was eruption, not obstruction.</p>, <p>What, we're going to impeach a president for venting, now? By that standard we should impeach Amy Klobuchar for that business with the salad and the comb. As the Wall Street Journal put it, Robert Mueller wants ""an impeachment inquiry to charge Donald Trump with obstructing an investigation that wasn't obstructed into a conspiracy that didn't exist.""</p>, <p>Mueller the straight shooter? With that bumbling, malicious press conference, he shot himself straight in the foot. His reputation is destroyed, and he has no-one to blame but himself.</p>, <p>Now it's time to fight back against the establishment. It's good that the origins of the plot against President Trump are now being investigated. But let's not leave it there.</p>, <p>What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice. You know what that is? The legal standard for defamation. President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>Next: Let's open a corruption investigation into the business dealings of Mueller and Comey in their swampy trips around the revolving door. Let's investigate those Lockheed Martin contracts. Let's investigate those client relationships at Mueller's swamp law firm where he had a conflict of interest.</p>, <p>Was there personal financial corruption? Let's investigate. After all, what's that phrase we've been hearing these last couple of years, ""we need to get to the bottom of it."" If Mueller and Comey have done nothing wrong, they've got nothing to fear from a corruption investigation. Right?</p>, <p>And let's take the fight to the ridiculous Never-Trumpers, too. Led by Bill Kristol, they're now joining the impeachment bandwagon with new ads under the banner of ""Republicans for the Rule of Law."" They say they're defending democracy.</p>, <p>Excuse me? They are literally attacking democracy, trying to overturn the democratic election of a president they despise. They talk about decency and honor and morality. What morality do they bring to the table, by the way?</p>, <p>Their demented ideology sent millons to their deaths in Middle East wars and cost our country trillions of dollars. Their dinner party decadence brought the authoritarian despots of China to the brink of world domination. And their craven genuflection to big business destroyed the American Dream for middle class families.</p>, <p>These Never -Trumpers, this corrupt establishment ... it is rotten. It has failed. But it's not dead yet.</p>, <p>They think they can kick out Trump and take back power. Do not let them. It's time to fight them. It's time to defeat them.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Steve Hilton's monologue on ""The Next Revolution"" on June 2, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Instead, as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has shown, they can win politically by delivering clean air and water programs that improve peoples’ quality of life. In short, they can separate <em>environment</em> from <em>climate</em>.</p>, <p>Voter approval of Republican Ron DeSantis, who won the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida"" target=""_blank"">Florida governor’s mansion</a> by a whisker last fall, is soaring. Polls have him at 60 percent or above, the highest in more than a decade for anyone holding that office.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-could-have-dems-facing-blue-collar-backlash-at-polls-some-say"" target=""_blank"">AOC'S GREEN NEW DEAL COULD HAVE DEMS FACING BLUE-COLLAR BACKLASH AT POLLS, SOME SAY</a></p>, <p>As a recent Mason Dixon<a href=""https://www.floridadaily.com/ron-desantis-in-excellent-shape-in-latest-mason-dixon-poll/%20%C2%A0%C2%A0""> poll </a>revealed, DeSantis scores well not only with Republicans but also with Democrats.</p>, <p>How has he done it? Partly by tackling full-force the algae blooms that garnered nationwide attention when they threatened Florida’s waters and economy. DeSantis created a top-drawer task force of environmental academics to study the toxic blue-green slime, put more effort behind monitoring the state’s water management procedures, vowed to oppose offshore drilling, allocated funds for cleaning up existing blooms, and promised a host of other measures including creating a 17,000 acre Everglades reservoir.</p>, <p>The aggressive commitment is working for him, and for the people of Florida. There’s a lesson there.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>Millennial voters want action on climate change. They won’t be impressed by rational debates on the topic, or cost-benefit analyses. They don’t care that China spews more pollution into the air than the U.S. and Europe combined, or that Beijing is still building coal-powered plants despite its empty promises to clean up its act. They are unimpressed that the U.S. is one of the few developed nations that has lowered emissions, because of the increased use of natural gas.</p>, <p>None of those facts damp the fervor of young voters. The GOP has to have an answer, or several answers, that focus the debate away from futuristic projections of sea changes or rising temperatures and instead on achievable, pragmatic solutions to existing environmental challenges that do not undermine our energy industries (which give U.S. producers an important competitive advantage) or our way of life.</p>, <p>For example: Republicans should attack the dumping of plastic into the oceans. Or, promise to follow through on the government’s long-stalled plan to dispose of <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">nuclear waste</a>. Or campaign on making sure every American has access to safe drinking water. Each region has individual issues, but some appeal nationally.</p>, <p>Like, for instance, cleaning up the oceans. The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>As Americans head to the beach this summer, they will find evidence of this blight; plastic floating in the sea off Cape Cod, fish that have swallowed parts of straws or other bits of garbage in the Great Lakes, water bottles washed up on Santa Monica Beach. This is a nationwide, indeed, a global problem.</p>, <p>The Ocean Conservancy reports that “every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) equates 8 million metric tons to the weight of 90 aircraft carriers.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation.</p>, <p>Plastic does not decompose; it just piles up. It does, however, break down into tiny bits called microplastics, generally smaller than 5 mm, which can end up in fish or other seas creatures we eat. The Conservancy says that 60 percent of seabirds and 100 percent of sea turtle varieties have plastic in their systems, having mistaken straws and other items for food.</p>, <p>While some plastic sinks to the ocean floor, some floats and can gather into large areas of debris. The largest “dump” of plastic garbage is found between Hawaii and California, in the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). The “patch” is estimated to cover a surface area of 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly three times the size of France. A group called Ocean Cleanup <a href=""https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/"">calculates</a> there are more than 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the dump, weighing an estimated 80,000 metric tons. </p>, <p>Attacking this pollution of our waterways is important, and would be popular.</p>, <p>Similarly, candidates should campaign on safely burying our nation’s nuclear waste in the Yucca Mountain site selected by Congress in 1987 but stalled for political reasons by the Obama administration in 2015. As Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">wrote</a> recently in the Wall Street Journal, the Yucca site sits on 8,400 square miles of U.S.-owned land, an area bigger than the state of Massachusetts. It has been determined that our nuclear leftovers could be safely buried there for at least one million years. </p>, <p>Moving forward on secure disposal might smooth the path for nuclear energy, which today supplies, as Barrasso points out, 60 percent of our carbon-free energy, or “more than three times the energy produced by wind and more than 18 times the amount from solar.” We cannot be serious about addressing climate change unless we welcome increased nuclear power.</p>, <p>After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation, and an important challenge, which Republicans would do well to embrace.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Climate and environment are not the same.

All you have to do is make wildly unrealistic promises and blame rich people for the world’s problems.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">After that, most of the left-wing media will fawn all over you for your “revolutionary” and “innovative” thinking—no matter how foolish the policy proposal might be.</p>, <p>Sanders’ <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders"">newest idea</a> is to have government build “millions” of new housing units to help improve access to “affordable” housing.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jeanne-allen-american-education-is-in-crisis-and-bernie-sanders-is-not-helping""><strong>JEANNE ALLEN: WE ARE AT WAR. THE BATTLEGROUND IS THE CLASSROOM. AND BERNIE SANDERS JUST DOESN'T GET IT</strong></a></p>, <p>“When I talk about infrastructure, I’ll tell you what else I’m talking about: The need to build millions of new units of affordable housing,” Sanders said at a rally on Wednesday in Reno, Nevada. “All over this country, you have people paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes in housing. That is absurd. Let’s put people to work, with good wages, to build the affordable housing this country needs.”</p>, <p>There’s no denying housing and rent prices are high in some parts of the United States, especially in many high-tax cities, where developers are forced—usually by Democratic Party-led governments—to pay exorbitant fees and comply with mountains of red tape to build new housing units, if they are allowed to do so at all. But saying the best solution to bringing down housing costs is to build millions of new houses is utterly ridiculous for several important reasons.</p>, <p><strong>First, there are already millions of vacant homes and apartments available across the country.</strong> Adding millions of new buildings would make it even harder for those looking to sell their homes or apartments to find buyers or tenants.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Sanders suggests that one of the benefits of his proposal would be that it would help “put people to work,” but in reality, it would merely take money away from other parts of the economy in the form of taxation and force people to pay for something the market is already providing.</p>, <p><strong>Second, there is absolutely no money available for another massive, costly government program. </strong>The federal government is expected to run a $900 billion deficit this fiscal year, and the national government is currently $22 trillion in debt. Even if we assume by “millions” of new housing units that Sanders means just three million new housing units, his plan would likely cost more than $300 billion (assuming a conservative figure of $100,000 per housing unit)—more than one-third of the budget deficit recorded in the 2017–18 fiscal year.</p>, <p><strong>Third, it’s a fallacy to say these new homes would be “affordable.”</strong> Although Sanders’ plan would reduce housing prices for some lower-income people, it would require raising taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars to cover the expenses. Contrary to the seemingly popular belief in the Democratic Party, money doesn’t simply fall from the sky.</p>, <p>Even if the revenues required are taken only from the wealthiest Americans and businesses, it’s extremely likely everyone would be forced to pay much of the costs in the form of higher prices for goods and services imposed by businesses and business owners to offset losses. There’s absolutely no reason to believe wealthy individuals and businesses will choose to pay higher taxes without passing along their costs through higher prices.</p>, <p>Further, other Democratic presidential candidates and Sanders have already called for creating dozens of other new government programs that would also require hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in new tax revenues. For example, the Green New Deal, which Sanders co-sponsored in the Senate, would cost tens of trillions of dollars in just the first decade. America’s billionaires literally do not have enough money to pay for even half the cost of the Green New Deal in just the first 10 years, so how does Sanders expect them to pay for this policy program too?</p>, <p><strong>Fourth, rather than encourage people to move out of poverty, Sanders’ plan would incentivize Americans to remain impoverished. </strong>If you knew you could get access to brand-new housing for a fraction of its market price by remaining in poverty, why would you try to move out of poverty?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p><strong>Fifth, Sanders suggested that one of the benefits of his proposal would be that it would help “put people to work,” but in reality, it would merely take money away from other parts of the economy in the form of taxation and force people to pay for something the market is already providing. </strong>So, while some parts of the economy would be improved by Sanders’ plan, numerous other parts would be greatly harmed in the process, and the net impact on the total economy would be negative, because hundreds of billions that could have been spent to innovate and expand businesses would be wasted on building new houses.</p>, <p>There’s nothing indicating America needs a huge new public housing plan, but that doesn’t matter to Sanders, whose only two interests are dramatically expanding the size and power of government and winning the presidency in 2020.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/justin-haskins""><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

D-Day has come to be remembered as the 20th century’s iconic battle, and with good reason. The operation was the largest if not the bloodiest of the war, itself the largest and certainly the bloodiest of the century, and perhaps our entire existence.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">But that was 75 years ago, ancient <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/archaeology/history"">history</a> for many of us. Ask a high school student today about D-Day, and at best you’ll get a sentence or two related to the war: VE Day, VJ Day. unless they are a current internet meme or perhaps part of a video game, you’re unlikely to get more than a blank stare.</p>, <p>This is not necessarily their fault. Even in high school, history classes spend scant time on either of the world wars and in many cases, the lessons convey only shallow clichés and worthless, if well-meaning, bromides.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/d-day-veterans-revisit-normandy-recall-horror-and-triumph""><strong>D-DAY VETERANS REVISIT NORMANDY, RECALL HORROR AND TRIUMPH</strong></a></p>, <p>Twenty, 30 or 40 years ago, this was not necessarily a big deal. There were plenty of people around who not only knew about the war, but had lived through it, fighting in Europe or Asia, sacrificing on the home front.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Find them — in your family, in a nursing home. Make the connection while it’s still possible. The future depends on it.</p>, <p>Those people are rapidly disappearing. The very youngest soldier on D-Day today is in his 90s. Having just done a book on the battle, I can tell you from personal experience there are not many survivors left. Perhaps a handful of men can still bear witness to the first wave at Omaha Beach; most will be gone by the 76th anniversary.</p>, <p>We won’t really know how much we’ve missed.</p>, <p>Fortunately, many stories of D-Day and the war have been recorded, directly from veterans in interviews and memoirs. We have countless photos and souvenirs. These tell us, and future generations, much about war.</p>, <p>But even the best and most vivid lack the truly emotional connection that comes from shaking the hand of a man who was there, after he tells you how cold the water was, or hugging him when he recounts how the soldier next to him died.</p>, <p>For all our technology and its ability to revive memory and conjure emotion, we have not yet found a way to replace the impact of another human one-on-one. Even the most vivid imagination cannot quite recreate the full color of experience without the presence of the man or woman who first lived it.</p>, <p>Not that we shouldn’t try, and not that we shouldn’t avail ourselves of technology to learn all that we can. But still privileged with the presence of the men and women who survived World War II, it behooves us all to seek them out and hear their stories.</p>, <p>They are called the Greatest Generation.

After two letters protesting Attorney General William Barr’s whitewashing of the Mueller Report, followed by multiple public mischaracterizations of it, Mueller resorted to a press conference at the Department of Justice to present the facts about his report. Then he resigned.</p>, <p>In nine minutes, Mueller laid out the facts in the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"">448-page report</a>: Russia interfered the 2016 election; Trump committed crimes; Barr lied; Congress must hold them accountable. Then for good measure, he repeated that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and every American should be concerned about it.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-faces-shouts-for-impeachment-at-california-democratic-party-convention""><strong>PELOSI FACES SHOUTS FOR IMPEACHMENT AT CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONVENTION</strong></a></p>, <p>Those nine minutes determined Donald Trump’s fate and the political dynamic of the 2020 election. There is no doubt these facts should have been presented 46 days ago. Instead, Trump, Barr, and a chorus of accomplices chose to lie. Now, it is clear in the wake of the Mueller press conference that those same facts will lead to impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump.</p>, <p>Let’s review the facts.</p>, <p>The fact is Mueller didn’t indict Trump because the Department of Justice policy states that a sitting president cannot be indicted, not because Trump was innocent. In fact, Mueller pointedly stated, “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” Mueller said no such thing. That is the only reason Trump is not indicted today. The day he leaves the White House, however, he can be. That is a fact.</p>, <p>Yet Barr continues to criticize Mueller for following this Department of Justice policy. If Mueller <em>had</em> indicted Trump, then Barr would no doubt have criticized him for <em>not</em> following DOJ policy.</p>, <p>That tells you everything you need to know about Trump, and about Barr. Facts don’t matter to them – but facts will determine their fate.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Trump and Barr are about to find out just how stubborn the facts are in this case when they are held accountable by Congress and the American people.</p>, <p>While turning a blind eye to facts has long been common practice for Trump, he now has a long list of accomplices, and none more important than the Attorney General of the United States, William Barr, acting as his consigliere. Barr already has a reputation for leading <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-and-barr-are-stonewalling-on-the-mueller-investigation-just-like-nixon-did-on-watergate"">cover-ups</a> and now he is at the helm of the biggest one since Watergate, facts be damned.</p>, <p>How else to explain Barr’s claim that Trump’s conduct did not constitute obstruction? Mueller laid out several examples where the facts make clear Trump did commit obstruction, including witness tampering when he instructed his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort not to cooperate with investigators. Or the effort to lobby former White House counsel Donald F. McGahn II to create a document contradicting his previous testimony that Trump wanted him to fire Mueller. There are also multiple instances where pardons were dangled to witnesses in exchange for protecting Trump. Each one of these examples is the definition of obstruction.</p>, <p>Presenting the facts publicly last week, Mueller made clear that while he may not be able today to hold Trump accountable – because he is in the White House – that Congress must. Mueller stated at his press conference that even without access to the entire Mueller Report, and underlying evidence that is being withheld by Barr, that there are more than enough facts to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.</p>, <p>Specifically, Section IV of the Constitution states that “The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanor.”  Therefore, to be impeached and removed from office, the House and Senate must find that the official committed one of these acts.</p>, <p>The distinction here is that impeachment is a political process, not a criminal one. And while the bar may be lower than that required for criminal charges, it is no less serious. Congress has no power to impose criminal penalties on impeached officials, but it can remove an official from office.</p>, <p>For Mueller to make that statement – one of the more serious that can be leveled against any president – it had to be based on the facts presented in his investigation, facts that Congress must now act upon. That is why it is clear in the wake of Mueller’s press conference that Trump will face impeachment. It is a matter of when, not if. Mueller has provided the facts to act and our democracy depends upon it.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>John Adams’ words, and his full quote, underscore the importance of Mueller’s investigation and our responsibility. “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence: nor is the law less stable than the fact.”</p>, <p>Trump and Barr are about to find out just how stubborn the facts are in this case when they are held accountable by Congress and the American people. That day of reckoning is rapidly approaching, just as Mueller outlined and as our Constitution demands.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/mary-anne-marsh""><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM MARY ANNE MARSH</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are reportedly battling for an endorsement from the progressive freshman lawmaker.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The most important political campaign this year that you’ve probably never heard of is the Democratic primary for district attorney in the<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york""> New York City</a> borough of Queens. Seven mostly unknown candidates will face off June 25.   </p>, <p class=""speakable"">Unless you live in Queens, why should you care?</p>, <p>Because the outcome of this obscure primary – to fill a vacancy created by the death of Queens District Attorney Richard Brown in March – will tell us a lot about the race for the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election"">2020 Democratic presidential nomination. </a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-endorses-queens-candidate-testing-her-political-influence-on-new-yorkers""><strong>AOC ENDORSES QUEENS CANDIDATE, TESTING HER POLITICAL INFLUENCE ON NEW YORKERS</strong></a></p>, <p>The outcome will indicate whether Democratic voters support candidates on the moderate-left, the far-left, or the socialist far-out extreme-left.</p>, <p>In fact, I believe that no poll, televised town hall, presidential tweet or anything else will be as predictive as the primary in Queens of who will become the Democratic nominee for president next year. </p>, <p>Queens is where Amazon nearly put in its second headquarters, until some New York politicians – most notably self-proclaimed democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – made the giant company unwelcome and prompted it to cancel its plans.</p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez – an extreme-left radical who bills herself as the friend of working men and women – said her opposition to “corporate greed” and <u style=""text-decoration:underline""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/doug-schoen-amazons-cancellation-of-a-move-to-nyc-is-bad-news-and-could-hurt-far-left-dems-at-polls"" style=""color:blue; text-decoration:underline"">“worker exploitation”</a></u> led her to help kill Amazon’s plan to create between 25,000 and 40,000 jobs paying salaries averaging more than $150,000 in her district. </p>, <p>Apparently, being unemployed and collecting government benefits is better than being an exploited worker earning a mere $150,000 salary in the congresswoman’s view. Workers of the world unite – and stop being workers, I guess.</p>, <p>The presence of firebrand Ocasio-Cortez – a media magnet for her radical views – is what makes this sleepy district attorney race so incredibly important.</p>, <p>The leading candidate in the Democratic primary is Melinda Katz, currently the borough president of Queens. She is a former corporate lawyer who served as a member of the New York state Assembly and the New York City Council and has a strong record of legislative accomplishments.</p>, <p>Katz, 53, was once called ""one of the one hundred up-and-coming young leaders for the 21st Century"" by the New York Daily News. Now she has the endorsement many groups representing a broad range of interests, including many ethnic groups and top labor unions.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The presence of firebrand Ocasio-Cortez – a media magnet for her radical views – is what makes this sleepy district attorney race so incredibly important.</p>, <p>Sounds like a dream candidate, right? Not so fast. </p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez – who apparently wants to be the political kingmaker and queen-maker of Queens and far beyond – has endorsed one of Katz’s opponents, Tiffany Cabán, who has support from the extreme left. Her backers include the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party. </p>, <p>Cabán is a 31-year-old a public defender and has never run for political office, like Ocasio-Cortez prior to 2018. Cabán needs all the help she can get, because she raised less than $1,000 for her campaign in the first quarter of this year. </p>, <p>Ocasio-Cortez says that Cabán is “a champion who will fight to realign our priorities towards equal treatment under the law.” </p>, <p>And now Cabán is following the Ocasio-Cortez political game plan. The candidate is implementing the same strategies that helped Ocasio-Cortez unseat longtime Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in the party’s primary last year.</p>, <p>So the Queens race is an under-the-radar test of Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to defeat establishment Democrats like Crowley in primaries and move the party as far left as she possibly can.</p>, <p>The Intercept, progressive website, describes Katz as if she were a political hack, calling her “a career politician with no courtroom experience who’s run for at least six offices throughout New York” with “machine backing and questionable past positions on issues from the death penalty to cash bail.”</p>, <p>But that doesn’t sound like who Melinda Katz really is. And just to be clear: I don’t work for Katz’s campaign, haven’t contributed to it, and frankly had never heard of her until I read the piece in The Intercept. I can’t even vote in Queens – my family moved out of the borough when I was a 5-year-old. </p>, <p>Ocasio Cortez’s game plan last year was to use social media (free) and ring enough doorbells (also free) to garner enough support to sneak up on a well-entrenched, well-funded incumbent and defeat him.</p>, <p>The stealth strategy worked for Ocasio-Cortez and now she is perhaps the most recognizable face (and one of the most followed on Twitter) in Washington after President Trump.</p>, <p>So if the grassroots and social media strategy boosts Cabán past Katz (and the other five candidates in the primary) you can consider what happens in this race a demonstration of the power of today’s progressive movement. And a demonstration of Ocasio-Cortez’s power as well.</p>, <p>Social media and campaigning on the street, block by block, are now powerful tools in politics. Having the most money, the most endorsements, or even the most coverage in traditional news media is no longer enough to defeat your opponents in a campaign</p>, <p>This is what used to be called “retail politics,” as opposed to what usually goes on today, which could be described as “whoever has the biggest media budget wins.”</p>, <p>So you can’t fault Cabán, Ocasio-Cortez and their grassroots supporters for doing what candidates are supposed to do: ring doorbells, kiss babies and get out the vote.</p>, <p>Melinda Katz is Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Mayor Pete, all rolled into one: an accomplished politician with an outstanding record of public service.</p>, <p><u style=""text-decoration:underline""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" style='font-family:""Times New Roman"",serif; color:blue; text-decoration:underline'>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></u></p>, <p>But none of that will matter if Cabán, who has done exactly nothing in electoral politics, wins.</p>, <p>The takeaway will be this: what happens in Queens will happen all over the country in local and statewide elections. You’ve been warned.</p>, <p>And if Cabán, defeats Katz I’m putting my money on democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont to be the Democratic nominee for president. </p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/michael-levin"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY MICHAEL LEVIN</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

      <!-- --></p>, <p>""I came from a district that was really rural -- Second Amendment was important, hunting was important,"" Gillibrand responded. ""I recognize people have different communities.""</p>, <p>Pressed on what changed once she arrived in the Senate and quickly received an ""F"" rating from the NRA, Gillibrand continued: ""Just realizing that not every part of this country is like my rural, upstate district.""</p>, <p>Gillibrand also issued a full-throated endorsement of abortion rights, and insisted she would ""codify Roe v. Wade, so it is forever the law of the land"" when asked to clarify whether she supported late-term abortions.</p>, <p>She also suggested ""all-male"" legislators were behind the passage of a slew of pro-life ""heartbeat"" laws that have passed recently in southern states. However, Alabama's female governor, Kay Ivey, enacted the state's restrictive anti-abortion law in May, while the Democratic representative behind a similar bill in Louisiana is <a href=""http://Democratic%20Rep.%20Katrina%20Jackson"" target=""_blank"">an African-American woman</a>. Several other women legislators also supported the bills.</p>, <p>At one point, Gillibrand attempted to attack <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-to-vote-on-born-alive-bill-to-protect-infants-who-survive-a-failed-abortion"" target=""_blank"">Fox News' coverage of Democrats' efforts to block anti-infanticide legislation</a>, in the wake of Virginia Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam's <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/northam-draws-ire-claims-of-infanticide"" target=""_blank"">apparent endorsement of the practice</a>.</p>, <p>But Wallace interjected, saying Gillibrand apparently wanted to enhance her credibility among progressives with impolite and inappropriate jabs at the network hosting her for the event.</p>, <p>Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand answers audience questions with moderator Chris Wallace in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>, <p>Wallace then probed Gillibrand's Dec. 2018 tweet stating that ""Our future is: Female, Intersectional, Powered by our belief in one another."" The tweet attracted mockery in conservative circles, with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio responding; ""Our future is: AMERICAN. An identity based not on gender, race, ethnicity or religion. But on the powerful truth that all people are created equal with a God-given right to life, liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness.""</p>, <p>""Really good questions, Chris,"" Gillibrand responded when asked what she meant by her remarks. ""What I mean by 'our future is female' is that we want more women's voices heard. I was so inspired by the 2018 election. ... Our first two Muslim-American women [elected to Congress].""</p>, <p>""What about men?"" Wallace asked.</p>, <p>""They're already there. Do you not know?"" Gillibrand replied, to applause. ""It's not meant to be exclusionary, it's meant to be inclusive.""</p>, <p>""That's very reassuring,"" Wallace said.</p>, <p>Gillibrand continued: ""Intersectional to me, means when you're discriminated against in more than one way."" She offered the example of a black, homosexual woman who is discriminated against because she is black, a woman, and gay.</p>, <p>At the California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco this weekend, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper <a href=""https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1134948783127576576"" target=""_blank"">elicited loud boos from attendees in a viral video moment</a> when he declared ""socialism is not the answer"" to enacting progressive policies and beating Trump. Hickenlooper quickly highlighted the negative reaction on his Twitter account: ""I know this message won't be popular with everyone in our party. But the stakes are too high. We cannot hand this election to Donald Trump.""</p>, <p>Hickenlooper also declared that ""we shouldn't try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from 150 million Americans,"" and said addressing climate change shouldn't necessitate ""guaranteeing every American a government job."" Both statements also drew boos.</p>, <p>Asked where she stood on the issue, Gillibrand refused to wholeheartedly endorse either capitalism or socialism.</p>, <p>""There's a lot of confusion,"" Gillibrand said. ""There's a big difference between capitalism and greed. We know what healthy capitalism looks like. ... Over the last few decades, we've seen income inequality grow because we care more today about shareholders than we do about workers.""</p>, <p>Gillibrand similarly toed both sides of the line on immigration, saying she ""fully support[s] border security."" But she also condemned President Trump's aggressive illegal immigration enforcement efforts, calling them ""inhumane."" She vowed a humane asylum process, more border security funding, and ""comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship"" -- a lofty legislative goal that has stalled several times in recent years.</p>, <p>The senator also implied the deaths of several children in Border Patrol custody were the fault of the Trump administration, without evidence. Advocates have long questioned the Border Patrol's ability to care for the thousands of parents and children in its custody, but there have been no indications that maltreatment in Border Patrol custody caused the deaths.</p>, <p>Since jumping into the race in January, Gillibrand has been hovering right around one percent – or less – in most national and early voting state polls. She’s watched one-time extreme long-shots like Buttigieg and entrepreneur Andrew Yang move ahead of her in the polls.</p>, <p>Asked how she could compete with frontrunner Joe Biden, Gillibrand responded, ""This is a marathon, not a sprint ... It's still early, I'm still introducing myself to the voters.""</p>, <p>Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand answers audience questions with moderator Chris Wallace in Dubuque, Iowa.</p>, <p>In a personal moment, Gillibrand defended her decision to call for former Minnesota Democrat Sen. Al Franken's ouster, amid allegations he behaved inappropriately and made improper physical contact with women. She described a conversation she had with her son at the time.</p>, <p>""Theo, it's not okay to grope a woman anywhere on her body without her consent. ... It's not OK for Al Franken, and it's not OK for you.""</p>, <p>Key Democrat donors reportedly swore off Gillibrand after the episode, saying she was trying to advance her own career at the expense of the party.

Notably absent, however, was the queen's husband, Prince Philip, who at 97 has retired from his royal duties.</p>, <p>At their initial visit to the palace early Monday morning, the president and first lady Melania Trump had a private lunch with the queen, later inspecting a collection of artifacts including an 18th-century map of New York, historic photos of golf at St. Andrews and books about birds and George Washington. He then participated in a wreath-laying at the Grave of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.</p>, <p>The visit began with formalities befitting a state visit. The Trumps were greeted by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, at the palace. Trump could be seen chatting with members of the Guard of Honor as the rest of the American delegation, from a terrace, observed the elaborate arrival ceremony, complete with the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Royal gun salutes were fired from nearby Green Park and from the Tower of London.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-rally-behind-mueller-statement-poised-to-impeach"" target=""_blank"">DEMS RAMP UP CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AFTER MUELLER SPEAKS OUT ON RUSSIA PROBE</a></strong></p>, <p>Juxtaposed against that scene, however, was an opening scrap between Trump and London Mayor Khan, who penned a critical column of the president he called a “global threat.” In the column, titled, “It’s un-British to roll out the red carpet for Donald Trump,” Khan listed Trump’s most controversial policies and likened them to the actions of European dictators of the 1930s and '40s.</p>, <p>Before he even arrived in London, Trump fired back calling Khan the “twin” of New York City’s liberal Mayor Bill de Blasio, “except shorter.”</p>, <p>Trump continued the attack Monday, calling Khan a “stone cold loser.”</p>, <p>Trump attempted to clarify that he would not let Khan dampen his trip and said he looks forward to his visit.</p>, <p>As Trump crossed London, he was shadowed — at a distance — by demonstrators, who planned to fly again a huge balloon depicting the president as a baby.

Bernie Sanders, taking some of his strongest shots to date at Biden, without naming him.</p>, <p>“We cannot go back to the old ways,” argued Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making a second straight run for the Democratic nomination.</p>, <p>Many Biden supporters argue that a time-tested and more centrist Democrat, like the former vice president, stands the best chance of defeating GOP President Trump in next year’s general election.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-repeatedly-targets-biden-for-top-dollar-fundraisers""><strong>SANDERS TARGETS BIDEN OVER TOP FUNDRAISERS </strong></a></p>, <p>Sen.

But the stakes are too high. We cannot hand this election to Donald Trump.""</p>, <p>Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland also sparked a chorus of boos from the audience when the centrist Democratic presidential candidate declared that “Medicare for All may sound good, but it’s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.”</p>, <p>Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a rising star among the progressive wing of the party, took aim at Delaney, saying it was time for him to “sashay away.”</p>, <p><br/>
“Since there’s so many people running for President (&amp; not enough for Senate), instead of obsessing over who‘s a 'frontrunner,' maybe we can start w some general eliminations,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “This awful, untrue line got boo’ed for a full minute. John Delaney, thank you but please sashay away.”</p>, <p>The next day Delaney challenged the congresswoman to debate him on the issue.</p>, <p>“Hey @AOC, we have the same goal, universal healthcare for everyone, we just have different ways of getting there. Healthcare is the #1 issue for voters, so let’s debate the way forward. Any show of your choosing. Healthcare is too important for tweets, we need real discussion,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>, <p>And on Monday he pleaded with progressives that “if you are booing Democrats, do you really expect the country to trust what you have to say if you can't listen respectfully to people in your own party? Let’s raise the discourse and not fall down to the level of the president.”</p>, <p>For Republicans, the tensions on display in San Francisco are a gift, as they continue to portray the Democrats as an increasingly leftward-leaning political party.</p>, <p>""Chaos is reigning supreme in the Democratic primary,” said Joe Gierut, press secretary for opposition research shop America Rising.</p>, <p>“This weekend's convention was a preview of the far-left, socialist policies that will be front and center on the debate stage. The Democratic Party's love for socialism was on full display as candidates started bruising each other ahead of the general election,” Gierut argued. “By the time we get to the national convention, socialism will be the official party platform that is juxtaposed with President Trump's record in office.""</p>, <p>Some Democrats worry that the deep divisions from 2016, when many Sanders supporters didn’t back Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election, could play out again in 2020 if Biden’s the nominee.</p>, <p>But Terry Shumaker, a New Hampshire-based attorney and former U.S. ambassador who was a top adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton and who is a top Granite State supporter of Biden, argued that the ""vice president's progressive record speaks for itself.""</p>, <p>He added that the strong desire by Democrats and some independents to oust Trump from the White House in 2020 makes the circumstances ""very different.""</p>, <p>Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, who served as a senior spokesman on the 2016 Clinton campaign, emphasized that “campaigns aren’t about refighting the last war, they’re about winning the next one….

Biden was the only big-name candidate to skip the gathering, opting instead to campaign in Ohio. That allowed Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Harris and others a chance to grab the spotlight.</p>, <p>California has shifted its 2020 primary earlier on the calendar, to March 3, part of the Super Tuesday collection of contests, in hopes of giving the state more sway in choosing the party's nominee. California will offer the largest delegate haul, but it is a notoriously difficult state to campaign in, given its massive size and expensive media markets.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bill-maher-biden-doesnt-look-good-he-looks-like-hes-on-a-coin"" target=""_blank""><strong>BILL MAHER SAYS BIDEN CANDIDACY WORRIES HIM: 'HE DOESN'T LOOK GOOD'</strong></a></p>, <p>Biden, speaking to thousands of activists at the Human Rights Campaign's Ohio gala Saturday night in Columbus, didn't mention his rivals but blasted Trump and his record on LGBTQ issues.</p>, <p>Some conservative commentators and activists questioned whether Biden was intentionally avoiding the spotlight, trying to maintain his lead without appearing to conflict with his Democrat rivals.</p>, <p>For example, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper took a different tack, eliciting loud boos in a viral video moment when he declared ""socialism is not the answer"" to enacting progressive policies and beating Trump. Hickenlooper quickly highlighted the negative reaction on his Twitter account: ""I know this message won't be popular with everyone in our party. But the stakes are too high.

Both statements also drew boos.</p>, <p>Biden, for the most part, has avoided directly addressing his stance on a range of hot-button issues important to the growing progressive wing of the Democrat Party, including the appeal of socialism and the Green New Deal.</p>, <p>""I hope a reporter or debate moderator remembers to ask Biden about this when he leaves the witness protection program,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/ArthurSchwartz/status/1134949164415180805"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Schwartz</a>, a conservative consultant close to the Trump family, wrote on Twitter.</p>, <p>In San Francisco, Warren's remarks served as the most direct jab at Biden, but 37-year-old South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg seemed to draw a contrast with the 76-year-old Biden when he said Democrats won't win if they bring more of the same to the 2020 contest.</p>, <p>""The riskiest thing we can do is play it safe,"" Buttigieg declared.

Eric Swalwell, a Californian who remains at the bottom of the pack in all major polls, also referenced Biden as he said ""we don't need a crime bill — we need a hope bill."" Biden has taken heat from some rivals for his support of a crime bill in the early 1990s that critics say spurred mass incarceration.</p>, <p>One of those rivals is Harris, though she made no direct or indirect references to Biden during her Saturday morning speech, instead highlighting her policy plans and bringing the crowd to its feet with calls to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">""The riskiest thing we can do is play it safe. There's no going back to normal.""</p>, <p>Harris received the prime spot of speaking first Saturday and sought to flex her home-state muscle by referencing her near-decade as a statewide elected official.

Cory Booker received perhaps the most enthusiastic response from the crowd, drawing people to their feet on multiple occasions. Warren reprised her ""I've got a plan for that"" slogan to raucous cheers as she pledged bold action on a variety of topics, including breaking up ""big tech,"" a strong rebuke in the home of Silicon Valley.</p>, <p>Booker was the only candidate to reference Friday's fatal shooting in Virginia Beach, Va., which left 12 people dead. Declaring he'd have plenty of time to talk about himself, he told the party that the election is about more than finding a ""savior"" and simply beating Trump.</p>, <p>Most candidates sought to bring California-specific elements into their speeches or burnish their liberal credentials. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke slipped seamlessly between Spanish and English, a key move in a state with a large Hispanic population, while Washington Gov. Jay Inslee highlighted his fight to raise the minimum wage and enact aggressive policies to fight climate change.</p>, <p>Other candidates who spoke Saturday were New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand; Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Former Obama housing chief Julian Castro and former Maryland Rep.

          Critics feels MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has lost credibility after endlessly pushing her theory on Russian collusion.

Many of the Times’ top reporters are aware and “rightly sensitive” about the paper’s reputation of leaning left, the source said, and appearing on “Maddow” makes it hard to convince people otherwise.</p>, <p>A handful of journalists work for the both the Times and MSNBC, including Peter Baker, Nick Confessore and Jeremy Peters. All three of those reporters declined to comment when individually asked about Maddow. The Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment, either.</p>, <p>The paper did tell Vanity Fair that it was simply reinforcing an existing policy to be consistent with the paper’s standards. But Peters appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, the morning after the news of a Times reporter being kept off Maddow broke. “Morning Joe” hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have a public feud with Trump, but haven’t pushed the Russia collusion theory as aggressively as Maddow.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/unmasked-book-ranks-the-media-members-who-hate-president-trump-from-jim-acosta-to-mika-brzezinski"" target=""_blank"">‘UNMASKED’ BOOK RANKS MEDIA MEMBERS WHO HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE MOST, FROM JIM ACOSTA TO MIKA BRZEZINSKI</a></strong></p>, <p>Maddow has dedicated much of her programming since Trump took office to hyperventilating over whether or not Trump colluded with Russia. Since Attorney General Bill Barr's letter summarizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released on March 24 indicating that a Trump campaign-Russia conspiracy didn’t exist, contradicting Maddow’s nightly narrative, her ratings have suffered.</p>, <p>Maddow <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rachel-maddows-suffer-after-mueller-report-determined-no-collusion"" target=""_blank"">lost nearly 500,000 viewers</a> for her first episode following the release of Barr’s letter.

In May she averaged 2.6 million – her worst month since Trump took office – and a far cry from the 3.1 million viewers she averaged during the <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-top-cable-news-programs-for-q1-2019/398468/"" target=""_blank"">first quarter</a> of 2019.</p>, <p>

The accident broke several of the mom’s bones and led to the premature birth of her child. The automaker is being sued for damages related to the accident but disputes claims of technical malfunctions.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">A California family has filed a product liability lawsuit against <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/make/tesla"" target=""_blank"">Tesla</a> after a woman was pinned against a garage wall when her 2-year-old son climbed into her parked Model X and accidentally drove it into her on Dec. 27, 2018.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">According to the lawsuit, Mallory Harcourt of Santa Barbara was eight months pregnant at the time of the incident, which resulted in several broken bones and led to the premature delivery of her second child, who was uninjured in the incident.</p>, <p>
<span class=""copyright"">(The Harcourt Family)</span></p>, <p>Harcourt, who took ownership of the car on Dec. 23, claims that she left the Model X parked in the driveway outside of her garage with its powered “Falcon Wing” rear doors open as she and her son went into their home. The boy then ran back to the car and climbed into the front seat and she went back to get him.</p>, <p>
      The Model X features unique ""Falcon Wing"" rear doors.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Tesla)</span></p>, <p>Harcourt recalls passing in front of the car when it accelerated toward her with the rear doors still opened, pushed her through the garage and held her against the back wall until neighbors arrived and were able to move it away from her. The Model X does not have a start button and is active when the keyfob is within range.</p>, <p><a href=""http://gokallaw.com/tesladangerousdesign/"" target=""_blank"">In a letter to the family’s law firm</a>, Tesla managing counsel Ryan A. McCarthy said that data retrieved from the car indicates that the driver unbuckled, the driver's door was opened and closed, the left rear door was opened and the driver's door was activated by the handle to reopen. The brake pedal was then pressed, which set off a function that automatically closes the power driver’s door and allowed the car to be manually shifted into drive as the vehicle issued alerts that doors were still open.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/auto/ntsb-tesla-autopilot-was-engaged-before-fatal-florida-crash"" target=""_blank"">NTSB: TESLA AUTOPILOT WAS ENGAGED BEFORE FATAL FLORIDA CRASH</a></strong></p>, <p>The logs show that the car then accelerated for a few seconds in a fashion consistent with the pressure on the pedal, save for a brief override when the brakes were reapplied. The car then registered an impact to the Falcon Wing door and was finally brought to a stop with the brakes and shifted itself into park when it sensed that both pedals had been released for a few seconds, as designed.</p>, <p>The lawsuit argues that the Model X should have additional safety interlocks to prevent the type of scenario and that the feature that automatically closes the door when the brake pedal is pressed “is illogical and serves to create numerous dangerous situations.”</p>, <p>Tesla wouldn’t comment directly on the lawsuit to <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/auto"" target=""_blank"">Fox News Autos</a>, but claims that it has never discovered a technical malfunction in any of its internal investigations of ‘unexpected’ acceleration reports.</p>, <p>Harcourt’s lawyer said that Tesla was served with the lawsuit last week, which seeks compensatory and punitive damages.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The Food and Drug Administration's first broad testing of food for a<a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/pfas-contaminated-water-linked-cancer"" target=""_blank""> worrisome class of nonstick, stain-resistant industrial compounds</a> found substantial levels in some grocery store meats and seafood and in off-the-shelf chocolate cake, according to unreleased findings FDA researchers presented at a scientific conference in Europe.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The FDA's disclosure is likely to add to concerns raised by states and public health groups that President Donald Trump's administration is not acting fast enough or firmly enough to start regulating the manmade compounds, called ""forever chemicals."" A federal toxicology report last year cited consistent associations between very high levels of the industrial compounds in peoples' blood and health risks but said there was not enough evidence to prove the compounds as the cause.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/pfas-contaminated-water-linked-cancer"" target=""_blank""><strong>ALABAMA WOMAN CLAIMS WATER TAINTED BY PFAS FROM 3M FACTORY CAUSED CANCER, HEALTH ISSUES</strong></a></p>, <p>The levels in nearly half of the meat and fish tested were double or more the only currently existing federal advisory level for any kind of the widely used manmade compounds, which are called per- and polyfluoroalykyl substances, or PFAS.</p>, <p>The level in the chocolate cake was higher: more than 250 times the only federal guidelines, which are for some PFAS in drinking water.</p>, <p>Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman Tara Rabin said Monday that the agency thought the contamination was ""not likely to be a human health concern,"" even though the tests exceeded the sole existing federal PFAS recommendations, for drinking water.</p>, <p>As a handful of PFAS contaminations of food emerge around the country, authorities have deemed some a health concern but not others. The agency considers each discovery of the compound in food case by case, including the kind of food, levels of contamination, frequency of consumption and latest scientific information, Rabin said.</p>, <p>""Measuring PFAS concentrations in food, estimating dietary exposure and determining the associated health effects is an emerging area of science,"" the FDA said.</p>, <p>PFAS, created by DuPont in 1938 and put into use for tough nonstick cookware, now exists in an estimated 5,000 varieties. Industries use the product to keep grease, water and stains off countless consumer items, including in food packaging, carpets and couches, dental floss and outdoor gear.</p>, <p>The chemicals also are found in firefighting foam, which the Department of Defense calls irreplaceable in suppressing jet-fuel fires. Especially around military bases and PFAS facilities, decades of use have built up levels in water, soil and some treated sewage sludge used to fertilize non-organic food crops and feed for livestock.</p>, <p>They've been a topic of congressional hearings, state legislation and intense federal and state scrutiny over the past two years.</p>, <p><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>The federal toxicology review last year concluded the compounds are more dangerous than previously thought, saying consistent studies of exposed people ""suggest associations"" with some kinds of cancers, liver problems, low birth weight and other issues.</p>, <p>Because the tough compounds are predicted to take thousands of years to degrade, and because older versions have been found to accumulate in peoples' bodies, PFAS has acquired the name ""forever chemicals.""</p>, <p>The Environmental Protection Agency earlier established a nonbinding health advisory threshold of 70 parts per trillion for two-phased out forms of the contaminant in drinking water.</p>, <p>Trump's EPA said it would consider setting mandatory limits instead in the wake of the federal toxicology report and after federally mandated water sampling found high levels in many drinking water systems around the country. The administration has called dealing with PFAS contamination a ""potential public relations nightmare"" and a ""national priority.""</p>, <p>Impatient for federal action, several states have moved to regulate the chemicals on their own, including setting standards for groundwater or drinking water.</p>, <p>In the FDA study, conducted in October 2017, researchers oversaw market basket testing for more than a dozen PFAS, drawing on samples of food on sale in three undisclosed mid-Atlantic cities.</p>, <p>FDA researchers discussed the results at the annual conference by the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry in Helsinki, Finland, last week.</p>, <p>Two environmental groups, the Environmental Defense Fund and the Environmental Working Group, obtained written results and charts from the FDA presentation and provided them to The Associated Press.</p>, <p>PFOS, an older form of PFAS no longer made in the U.S., turned up at levels ranging from 134 parts per trillion to 865 parts per trillion in tilapia, chicken, turkey, beef, cod, salmon, shrimp, lamb, catfish and hot dogs. Prepared chocolate cake tested at 17,640 parts per trillion of a kind of PFAS called PFPeA.</p>, <p>The FDA presentation also included what appeared to be previously unreported findings of PFAS levels — one spiking over 1,000 parts per trillion — in leafy green vegetables grown within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of an unspecified eastern U.S. PFAS plant and sold at a farmer's market.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/health/california-girl-diagnosed-rat-bite-fever-pet-rats"" target=""_blank""><strong>CALIFORNIA GIRL, 8, DIAGNOSED WITH RAT-BITE FEVER AFTER PLAYING WITH PET RATS</strong></a></p>, <p>It also previewed test levels for a previously reported instance of PFAS contamination of the food supply, in the feed and milk at a dairy near an Air Force base in New Mexico.</p>, <p>The FDA said the contamination in that milk was a health concern. It said it would release detailed data on that soon.</p>, <p>The FDA in 2015 and 2016 revoked approval for some older versions of PFAS in food packaging, although it was one of those versions that was found in high levels in its testing of meat and seafood.</p>, <p>In its statement, the FDA noted studies suggesting newer forms may also pose a health risk. It said it was working with other federal agencies to determine appropriate next steps.</p>, <p>""What this calls for is additional research to determine how widespread this contamination is and how high the levels are,"" Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said separately in an interview. ""We have to look at total human exposure — not just what's in the water or what's in the food ... or not just dust. We need to look at the sum totals of what the exposures are.""</p>, <p>Birnbaum added, ""Nobody is exposed to just one form of PFAS in isolation. You're exposed to a whole mixture.""</p>, <p>It's unclear what human health risks are posed by the presence of PFAS chemicals in foods, said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist at East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, who studies PFAS compounds.</p>, <p>The discovery of PFAS contamination in wells and land around a Chemours Co. manufacturing plant near Fayetteville has made North Carolina one of the focuses of study for exposures.</p>, <p>""Drinking one glass of contaminated water is unlikely to be associated with health risks, as is eating one slice of contaminated chocolate cake,"" DeWitt said. ""Individually, each item is unlikely to be a huge problem, but collectively and over a lifetime, that may be a different story.""</p>, <p>Sally Brown, a University of Washington researcher who supports the use of treated sewage sludge by agriculture, said the FDA's findings were ""not a major concern.""</p>, <p>""If you are worried about this type of compound it makes sense to ban the cookware and the dental floss"" treated with PFAS, Brown said.</p>, <p>Near Fayetteville, neighbors of the Chemours PFAS facility are making plans for a Fourth of July parade float dedicated to warning others just how widely PFAS was turning up in the area.</p>, <p>The float will feature men fishing in a contaminated pond and vegetables growing in a contaminated garden, said Michael Watters, who lives a mile (1.6 kilometers) from the plant. Watters said he has stopped consuming well water and vegetables from his own land.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Trump vow dramatic action on border crisis; Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward reacts.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Washington, D.C., district court Judge Trevor McFadden threw out <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-files-suit-against-trump-administration-over-emergency-declaration"" target=""_blank"">House Democrats' lawsuit</a> seeking an injunction against President Trump's emergency border wall funding reallocation, saying that the matter is fundamentally a political dispute and that the politicians lack standing to make the case.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Trump had declared a national emergency this past February over the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, following Congress' failure to fund his border wall legislatively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Democrats then filed suit in April, charging that Trump was ""stealing from appropriated funds” by moving $6.7 billion toward border wall construction.</p>, <p>Democrats argued that the White House had ""flouted the fundamental separation-of-powers principles and usurped for itself legislative power specifically vested by the Constitution in Congress."" But, in <a href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/judge-rules-house-doesnt-have-standing-border-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">his ruling</a>, McFadden, a Trump appointee, suggested Democrats were trying to usurp the political process.</p>, <p>""This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government. To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers,"" McFadden wrote in his <a href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/judge-rules-house-doesnt-have-standing-border-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">opinion</a>. ""The Court declines to take sides in this fight between the House and the President.""</p>, <p>Border Patrol has picked up the migrants caught on this tape.</p>, <p>McFadden emphasized that under the so-called ""political question doctrine"" and existing Supreme Court precedent, courts generally stay out of politically sensitive matters best left to voters. And, he noted that House Democrats had the burden of demonstrating that they had standing -- a difficult hurdle for any plaintiff to clear, which involves showing a particularized injury that the court can address.</p>, <p>Especially in the context of political questions involving legislators, McFadden asserted, the availability of other ""institutional remedies"" -- actions prescribed by the constitution besides litigation -- counseled against finding that Democrats had standing.</p>, <p>For example, McFadden noted Democrats had various other methods with which to pursue their objectives legislatively. The Trump administration argued in its brief that when Congress was concerned about ""unauthorized Executive Branch spending in the aftermath of World War I, it responded not by threatening litigation, but by creating the General Accounting Office"" -- an argument the judge cited appprovingly in his opinion.</p>, <p>""Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,"" McFadden wrote. ""These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration's planned construction of the border wall.""</p>, <p>McFadden quoted former Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in the seminal 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, in which Marshall wrote, the ""province of the [C[ourt is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to enquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.""</p>, <p>McFadden also wrote, quoting from another Supreme Court case, ""Intervening in a contest between the House and President over the border wall would entangle the Court 'in a power contest nearly at the height of its political tension' and would 'risk damaging the public confidence that is vital to the functioning of the Judicial Branch.'""</p>, <p>Democrats argued in their lawsuit the president had overstepped his authority under the Appropriations Clause by inaccurately interpreting two of its key provisions. But, McFadden said, Democrats retained the power to modify or even repeal that law if they wanted to ""exempt future appropriations"" from the Trump administration's reach. Because the White House had not ""nullified"" that legislative power, McFadden wrote, there was no urgent need for judicial intervention sufficient to override the considerations of the political question doctrine.</p>, <p>Lawmakers expressly approved only $1.375 billion in the weeks after the shutdown, to go toward funding to 55 miles of wall along the southern border. But, Trump said that was inadequate, and he pushed ahead by moving funds from other Homeland Security projects previously approved by legislators. In his budget request earlier this year, Trump formally requested another $8.6 billion from Congress, saying that would be sufficient to build more than 700 miles of wall.</p>, <p><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>At a hearing in May, McFadden hinted that courts should stay out of the matter -- and suggested an appeal was imminent regardless.</p>, <p>""I’m not sure how much necessarily our views will carry the day for the courts above us,"" McFadden said at the hearing.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Many DOJ staffers are opposing the deal on the grounds that it would reduce the number of wireless carriers and they believe will lead to price increases for consumers.</p>, <p style="" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;""><a href=""https://www.scribd.com/document/412294536/2019-05-31-Letter-to-AAG-Delrahim-Re-TMO-Sprint-WH-Influence#from_embed"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""View 2019.05.31_Letter to AAG Delrahim Re TMO-Sprint WH Influence on Scribd"">2019.05.31_Letter to AAG Delrahim Re TMO-Sprint WH Influence</a> by <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/user/452990516/FOX-Business#from_embed"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""View FOX Business's profile on Scribd"">FOX Business</a> on Scribd</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The signatories include three Democratic Presidential candidates: Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar.

(T-Mobile) and Sprint Corporation (Sprint). In light of the potential implications of this transaction for American consumers, we write to reiterate that the Department’s decisions should be based on an impartial analysis of the facts and the law, and must be entirely free of improper political influence.”</p>, <p class=""advert-txt"">Advertisement</p>, <p class=""foxbusiness_mid_article_caption tl-caption"" style=""color:#222;text-align:left !important;display: -webkit-box;-webkit-line-clamp: 3;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;overflow: hidden;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;"">

</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The letter specifically cited an <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/white-house-voices-support-for-deal-as-doj-staff-looks-to-nix-merger-but-antitrust-chief-undecided"">FBN report</a> that “Trump administration economic officials are making it clear they support T-Mobile’s proposed $26 billion purchase of Sprint, a move that could place the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division on a collision course with senior White House advisers if the agency chooses to oppose the merger...”</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">As first reported by FOX Business, senior White House economic and national security officials have largely sided with the arguments presented by T-Mobile/Sprint executives that the antitrust concerns of the merger are overblown and that a stronger combined company will provide more competition in the wireless market particularly in the area of superfast 5G technology. Federal Communications Commission chief Ajit Pai recently signaled his agency’s approval of the transaction after the company’s agreed to minor concessions. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The ultimate decision will be made by Delrahim, a Trump appointee, who could reject the staff recommendation and approve the merger on his own. For now, Delrahim is said to be undecided as company officials continue to meet with the Antitrust Division to push the deal through. The DOJ can oppose the deal by announcing a lawsuit to block the merger in federal court. A decision could come as early as this week.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">A DOJ spokesman had no immediate comment.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Even as the DOJ staff has expressed misgivings about the deal, the companies have argued a combined T-Mobile and Sprint would be a stronger competitor to major wireless carriers AT&amp;T and Verizon and would continue to compete with them on pricing.  They’ve argued that the combined company will be able to better compete with foreign outfits, particularly from China, in 5G cellular wireless technology. Meanwhile, Sprint is such a weak carrier that by itself it cannot compete with the bigger wireless players on pricing and its <a href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/features/sprints-finances-t-mobiles-26b-tie-up"">survival could be in jeopardy</a> if the deal fails. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The Trump Administration has made U.S. advancement of 5G technology a key economic and national-security policy goal because it is expected to create millions of new jobs, add to GDP and protect the US from foreign spying.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">But Delrahim faces a difficult choice given his department’s opposition to the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger, which was generally regarded as less concerning from an anti-competitive standpoint. His staffers are arguing that if the deal goes through, the wireless business will be dominated by three large players and the antitrust implications are significant given the dominance of wireless technology in the lives of most Americans.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">As FOX Business reported, company officials have been offering additional concessions to those they made to gain FCC approval, including divesting the prepaid business Boost, building out 5G in rural areas, and committing to not raise prices for three years. The talks are said to be fluid, but the additional concessions that have been discussed with the DOJ involve selling spectrum and more prepaid businesses, according to people with knowledge of the matter.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Shares of Sprint, the would-be acquired company should the deal go through, have declined from $7.68 per share to $6.64 per share since the FCC gave the deal a green-light on May 20, reflecting sentiment on Wall Street traders that DOJ will not approve the merger. </p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Is the Trump team trying to sway the DOJ to approve the T-Mobile-Sprint deal?</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">With prices starting at $5,999, the new Mac Pro will rank as one of Apple’s most expensive – and powerful -- pieces of hardware when it goes on-sale this fall.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Spoiler Alert: Holzhauer's stunning run on Jeopardy rakes in millions.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">The Trump administration increased tariffs on goods from China in May and the impact is being felt.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">For Americans planning their retirement, more than half are making a poor assumption – that they will be able to still work during their golden years.</p>, <p class=""description"">URL</p>, <p class=""address""><a href="""">https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/democratic-lawmakers-are-crying-foul-over-a-potential-approval-of-t-mobile-sprint-26b-deal</a></p>, <p>Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

And boy did we see them in action last week. This was the week that <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Robert Mueller</a> put himself in the arena</p>, <p class=""speakable"">With his bizarre new doctrine of ""not not guilty,"" <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-russia-no-collusion-trump-barr-bret-baier"">he overturned the presumption of innocence</a>. Then, with his unsubtly coded call for the impeachment of President Trump, he revealed his real aim: Overturning the 2016 election.</p>, <p>Mueller was hired to be a neutral arbiter, to bring a clear conclusion that the country could unite behind. But on Wednesday, he ripped off the mask of neutrality and showed himself for what he is: A partisan in the fight between the populists and the establishment.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/steve-hilton"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.</strong></a></p>, <p>We shouldn't be surprised -- Mueller<em> is</em> the establishment. He's a swamp lawyer, as we told you months ago in our ""Swamp Watch"" episiode on the special counsel and his best buddy, James Comey last August.</p>, <p>Remember, Robert Mueller was previously director of the FBI. And James Comey was previously deputy attorney general. By an incredible coincidence, once Comey left that job to become the multi-million-dollar general counsel of defense giant Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin was awarded contract after contract, over a billion dollars' worth, by Robert Mueller's FBI.</p>, <p>And there's more, as we told you, last August:. I said the following:</p>, <p><em>""Robert Mueller's swampiness goes beyond awarding billion dollar contracts to his best friend's employer.. After leaving his post as FBI director, what did this modern-day saint, this paragon of ethics and integrity do? He cashed in, of course. Mueller went back to work for his old law and lobbying firm, now called Wilmer-Hale. And surprise surprise, his clients were directly related to his previous government work. One of them was Booz-Allen-Hamilton -- like Lockheed Martin, a giant surveillance contractor. Bloomberg has called them 'the world's most profitable spy agency.'""</em></p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-the-next-revolution-with-steve-hilton/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>That's the establishment code: You protect each other. Always. And you take down any and every threat to your power. That's how to understand last week's extraordinary intervention by Mueller. It was the establishment's final stand against their mortal enemy - Trump, and the peasant's revolt he led in 2016.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice ...  President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>They tried to stop him getting elected by clearing Hillary Clinton. They tried to bring him down by manufacturing a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Russia collusion scandal</a>. And when all that failed, last week Robert Mueller played the obstruction card.</p>, <p>Strip away all the tortured legalese and intellectual incoherence, it all boiled down to one thing - Mueller saying, ""I can't prove he did it, but [wink] he did it."" He talked about ""another process,"" and with that weak, pathetic attempt to hide the explosive nature of what he was really saying, Mueller called on Congress to impeach the president.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Impeach him for what? He didn't plot with Putin to steal the election. Mueller found no evidence for that crazed establishment fantasy, despite two years of trying</p>, <p>The president didn't obstruct justice. Mueller found no evidence of that, either, as he himself admitted in a clarification put out later that same day. Mueller's claim that it was the regulation about not indicting a sitting president that stopped him recommending charges was a lie.</p>, <p>Let's be really clear about that: Robert Mueller -- yes, the straight-shooting man of integrity, Robert Mueller -- lied from the podium last Wednesday. He lied to cover up the fact that he didn't find evidence of obstruction to justify a criminal charge.</p>, <p>What did he he find? Stories about the president losing his temper. Of course he lost his temper! If a totally manufactured conspiracy theory about you being a traitor to your country and colluding with an enemy power derails your presidency for years, wouldn't you be annoyed about it? This was eruption, not obstruction.</p>, <p>What, we're going to impeach a president for venting, now? By that standard we should impeach Amy Klobuchar for that business with the salad and the comb. As the Wall Street Journal put it, Robert Mueller wants ""an impeachment inquiry to charge Donald Trump with obstructing an investigation that wasn't obstructed into a conspiracy that didn't exist.""</p>, <p>Mueller the straight shooter? With that bumbling, malicious press conference, he shot himself straight in the foot. His reputation is destroyed, and he has no-one to blame but himself.</p>, <p>Now it's time to fight back against the establishment. It's good that the origins of the plot against President Trump are now being investigated. But let's not leave it there.</p>, <p>What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice. You know what that is? The legal standard for defamation. President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>Next: Let's open a corruption investigation into the business dealings of Mueller and Comey in their swampy trips around the revolving door. Let's investigate those Lockheed Martin contracts. Let's investigate those client relationships at Mueller's swamp law firm where he had a conflict of interest.</p>, <p>Was there personal financial corruption? Let's investigate. After all, what's that phrase we've been hearing these last couple of years, ""we need to get to the bottom of it."" If Mueller and Comey have done nothing wrong, they've got nothing to fear from a corruption investigation. Right?</p>, <p>And let's take the fight to the ridiculous Never-Trumpers, too. Led by Bill Kristol, they're now joining the impeachment bandwagon with new ads under the banner of ""Republicans for the Rule of Law."" They say they're defending democracy.</p>, <p>Excuse me? They are literally attacking democracy, trying to overturn the democratic election of a president they despise. They talk about decency and honor and morality. What morality do they bring to the table, by the way?</p>, <p>Their demented ideology sent millons to their deaths in Middle East wars and cost our country trillions of dollars. Their dinner party decadence brought the authoritarian despots of China to the brink of world domination. And their craven genuflection to big business destroyed the American Dream for middle class families.</p>, <p>These Never -Trumpers, this corrupt establishment ... it is rotten. It has failed. But it's not dead yet.</p>, <p>They think they can kick out Trump and take back power. Do not let them. It's time to fight them. It's time to defeat them.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Steve Hilton's monologue on ""The Next Revolution"" on June 2, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

I'm proud, of our American president.</p>, <p>But I'll tell you this: I do not like to see the disrespect. And there's been a lot of it in Britain. The leftover there is the same as the leftover here: they detest Mr. Trump and go out of their way to insult him. This rubs me up the wrong way.</p>, <p>The Brits should be reminded that they have brought a crisis on themselves.

Without American soldiers, those people would be speaking German.</p>, <p>I went back to Britain two months ago: it was my first visit there in many years. I had heard all the stories about how unpopular President Trump is there, and yes, I heard some harsh criticism.</p>, <p>But I also heard this: ""We could use a man like him over here.""

At an enormous personal cost, they were determined to restore freedom, peace, order, and life to a continent overrun by Nazis. It is good we remember but remembering imposes a burden.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Two days after Allied troops liberated Rome, “Operation Overlord” was launched by General Dwight Eisenhower, then the Supreme Allied Commander. American boys had to take Omaha Beach, a five-mile beachhead linking British troops on Gold to the east and Americans at Utah to the west. American dead at Omaha that day numbered 1,465; 3,184 wounded; 1,928 missing;  26 captured.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/d-days-24-hours-changed-20th-century-and-europe-forever"" target=""_blank"">D-DAY'S 24 HOURS CHANGED 20TH CENTURY, AND EUROPE, FOREVER </a></strong></p>, <p>Storming Omaha Beach involved living through release from landing craft, slogging through ocean, crossing 200 yards of open sand (soon littered with bodies), then scaling a massive rock wall (Google “Normandy cliff wall”) into dug-in German bunkers -- all under raining mortars, artillery shells, small arms, and “interlocking fields” of machine gun fire.</p>, <p>The men who died threw themselves at this impossible task with knowledge and inconceivable courage; the men who lived also did that, and always counted the heroes who did not make it home -- the ones buried under rows of white crosses and Stars of David just above the beach.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Many of us are blessed to have grown up among WWII boys who got home, grew into men, became fathers, built America, rebuilt Europe, and aged to grandfathers. Now, the ones we still have, are old men with extraordinary knowledge. Their knowledge is what I want to talk about.</p>, <p>Standing on Omaha Beach some 40 years after D-Day, I was young. I strained to see what they had seen, tried to imagine what these boys -- younger than I was then -- had done, what they had felt, suffered, endured and accomplished. Frankly, I could not. That is part of the knowledge they have, which Hollywood and books cannot replicate.</p>, <p>In college, I worked at a YMCA one summer. A quiet WWII veteran took care of the place, and he had a hard time hearing. One day, I asked him about his wartime experience. His story tumbled out. His Landing Craft Assault (LCA) was hit by a mortar on approach. Every soldier was killed, except him. The concussion threw him and took his hearing, but he lived. He was grateful for every day.</p>, <p>
      FILE - In this June 6, 2014 file photo, allied troops crouch behind the bulwarks of a landing craft as it nears Omaha Beach during a landing in Normandy, France.
      <!-- --></p>, <p>Growing up in a town of 500, one of my high school teachers -- a father of six -- was at Omaha Beach that fateful day. He never talked about it. Only later did I learn his LCA hit the sand, the ramp came down, and the front row of soldiers were all killed. In row two, he was fast up and out, got promoted to captain on the beach, and later earned the Croix de Guerre for heroism at Argonne. He never talked about it, but he had knowledge.</p>, <p>His wife’s only brother, also from our town, earned the Distinguished Service Cross after he was killed at Sicily helping save his company.</p>, <p>Another local was a scout in the Italian campaign -- creeping to the front lines nightly to light up German positions for American artillery. He journeyed from Naples, through Anzio, Rome, and across the Arno River, into the Po Valley, chasing Nazis up through the Brenner Pass. He never talked about it, until late. He had deep knowledge -- the sort it takes a lifetime to process.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Some who risked all at Normandy remain with us. Some who were at Sicily, Anzio, Bastogne, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and a thousand other life-and-death, all-depends-on-winning-there battles are with us. They won a war that still makes the world shudder.</p>, <p>And so, who did this extraordinary thing? Who threw their lives into the teeth of evil to recover and preserve freedom? Famous generals? Yes. But mostly American boys, ages 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>, <p>American boys pushed the Nazis back from what was supposed to be “death at the waterline” on Omaha Beach. They were joined at Normandy by other boys from Australia, Poland, France, Greece, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and New Zealand. They were boys.</p>, <p>As we reflect on June 6, 1944, let’s remember the impossible accomplishment and the knowledge these boys were forced to gain early and bring home.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>What is the burden remembering imposes? It is enormous and modest. It is being equal to our time, worthy of their sacrifice. That is the enormous side: doing what we must do to preserve freedom in our time. The modest is this: they are still with us. Go visit a WWII veterans’ home, family friend, old teacher, or close relative, and say thank you.</p>, <p>They will not come to you, but they have knowledge.

Or that “Melania Trump’s Outfit Clashes with Camilla’s as they meet at Buckingham Palace.”</p>, <p>President Trump has a full foreign policy agenda scheduled for this visit in addition to the pomp and ceremony of the state visit.</p>, <p>He will attend services commemorating the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>, <p>He is also expected to address such critical issues as the future of Brexit, offering needed encouragement, and no doubt re-iterating his support for a bi-lateral U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, once Britain is unshackled from the EU.</p>, <p>Additionally, he will try to shore up Britain’s evolving positions on Iran and China’s Huawei’s expanded operations in the U.K.</p>, <p>To say it has been an eventful several years due to the Brexit political situation would be an understatement and President Trump arrives just after the embattled Theresa May has announced her resignation after failing in her mission to deliver Brexit. Here again, the media are having a field day attacking Trump for wading into waters they judge inappropriate for a visiting leader.</p>, <p>Their criticism is completely misguided considering the critical importance to the global order of the U.S.-U.K. Special Relationship.</p>, <p>Trump is absolutely right to offer his support to our staunchest ally considering the economic, cultural, and military bonds that exist between the two nations.</p>, <p>The press has been so selective in their condemnation considering their silence when Obama also waded into Brexit waters but predictably on the Remain side, the side more in line with the narratives of the 'new world order’ global press.</p>, <p>Trump will also face major protests in the U.K. not unlike the hysterical chorus in the U.S. that hates him simply because he is an American exceptionalist. London’s far-left Mayor Sadiq Khan, famous for brushing off the carnage of terrorist attacks in his city with the cavalier statement,  that such acts are  'part and parcel of life in a big city’ has once again authorized the nonsensical ‘Baby Trump’ balloon. Trump returned the favor Monday morning by tweeting that the mayor had “by all accounts” done a “terrible job” just as he landed in London</p>, <p>Sadly, Megan Markle, the new Duchess of will not attend Monday’s luncheon where she could have been the only member of the royal family member of American origin in the room. Happily other members of her new family, including her husband, Prince Harry will be present.</p>, <p><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Despite the protests, the Trumps will be among a select few to enjoy the hospitality of a singular host who has reigned for 67 years and met every U.S. president since 1952, except Lyndon Johnson.</p>, <p>Trump could accomplish a lot with his visit. He could encourage the government transition to resolve Brexit, spearhead a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, make the world safer from the actions of Iran and China. Heck, he could even announce a cure for cancer and resurrect Churchill while in Britain and still the press won’t give him a break.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">The new book 'Unmasked: Big Media's War Against Trump' ranks the members of the media who hate President Trump the most. Who has made the list?</p>, <p class=""speakable"">In 2016 the nation’s <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/media"">top two newspapers</a> responded to Donald Trump’s election with arrogant new slogans, virtually declaring war on him. The New York Times aired TV ads proclaiming “Truth: It's more important now than ever.” Apparently, truth hadn’t been <em>that</em> important when Barack Obama or Bill Clinton were president.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The Times even sold T-shirts with the slogan, pairing with a Japanese fashion company and seeling them for a mere $300 – a funny way to fight red-state Make America Great Again populism.</p>, <p>The Washington Post chose a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/media"">new motto</a> that is now published on its masthead every morning: ""Democracy Dies in Darkness."" Look out! Trump was going tyrannical and by God, the Washington Post was going to stop that.     </p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/unmasked-bozell-trump-cnn-msnbc""><strong>'UNMASKED' CO-AUTHOR SAYS 'RADICALIZED' MEDIA WANTED TO DESTROY TRUMP, BUT IT BACKFIRED</strong></a></p>, <p>""This is actually something we’ve said internally for a long time in speaking about our mission,"" Shani George, communications director at the Post, told The Huffington Post in explaining the motto. ""We thought it would be a good, concise value statement that conveys who we are to the many millions of readers who have come to us for the first time over the last year.""</p>, <p>Like many in the media, they have described Trump as waging a ""war on the press,"" and then denying they were involved. ""We're not at war with the administration,"" proclaimed Marty Baron, the Washington Post editor. ""We're at work.""</p>, <p>That’s not the truth. “Democracy Dies in Darkness” is a call to war.</p>, <p>To underline the chumminess between these two beacons of truth and forthrightness in this Trump era, the New York Times published a story that attempted to shame Trump’s attack on the ""Amazon Washington Post,"" with media reporter Sydney Ember including a bucket of defensive quotes from Baron, saying he would not be “cowed” by the president’s invective. “We cover him the way that we feel any president should be covered,” he lied.</p>, <p>In 2016, Baron pitched a fit when the Trump campaign temporarily withdrew press credentials from the Washington Post. This didn’t mean they couldn’t cover Trump. It just meant Post reporters couldn’t travel on the campaign plane. The Post editorial board harrumphed that “Mr. Trump capped a day of assaulting fundamental liberal democratic values by announcing he would ban Post reporters from covering his campaign events. If this is his inclination now, imagine how he might wield the powers of the presidency.”</p>, <p>Holy smokes. The Post is that essential to the Republic?</p>, <p>That’s hypocritical, and they knew it. The Post didn’t write an outraged editorial in 2015 when the Hillary Clinton campaign banned right-leaning reporter David Martosko of the London Daily Mail from her campaign print pool. They expressed no editorial-page outrage as the Obama administration routinely insulted and avoided Fox News, describing it as “not a news organization.”</p>, <p>There was no editorial when, days before the 2008 election, the Obama campaign kicked three McCain-endorsing papers off their plane – the Washington Times, the New York Post, and the Dallas Morning News – to make room for the enthusiastic Obama-promoting magazines Ebony, Essence, and Jet. “Reporter Off Obama Plane: Times Editor Squawks,” read the headline on a brief Post news item about it.</p>, <p>We embrace the notion of a free press as a hallowed institution essential to the democratic process, providing checks and balances to our system of government. But no such honor exists in the industry today. There is no system of checks or balances when the Democrats are in charge; however, once Republicans are in office, their idea of “balancing” power is to savage them mercilessly.</p>, <p>Underneath all their “war on the press” outrage, the media are suggesting that no one has the right to check or balance <em>them</em>. To resist the “Resistance” is somehow undemocratic. They paint themselves as dangerously ""under siege"" when their political agenda is exposed and their commitment to “the truth” is questioned.</p>, <p>Donald Trump mocks them energetically as ""Fake News"" factories, and they’re horrified that anyone would dare treat them so. In their minds America has entered an ""authoritarian"" phase and the ignorant deplorables just don’t see it. Chanting ""CNN sucks"" at a rally is a rigorous, if coarse, exercise of freedom of speech. It is not a repeal of the concept. It is, however, a rejection of an industry that wraps itself around that concept as a means of advancing a far-left one-sided narrative.</p>, <p>During the Trump transition, CNN’s resident media expert Brian Stelter attacked Trump’s attempt to “delegitimize” the press and “create the idea that someone out there is the enemy.” He pushed reporters to use the A-word: “I talk to international correspondents who say to you, ‘This is exactly what authoritarians do. This is what strongmen do. This is what happens in authoritarian regimes.’ I think we need to start using those words on TV, at least, to discuss the possibilities before us.”</p>, <p>In the middle of the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court fight, however, Stelter appeared on a press panel discussion in Washington and admitted this cavalcade of panic was overwrought. “I think some of the greatest fears of the Trump era have not come to pass. We have not seen mass jailings of journalists. These were true fears after election night in 2016, given the president’s awful rhetoric toward the press.”</p>, <p>Translation: I panicked. Sorry.</p>, <p>It’s been a regular trope of Stelter &amp; Co. that Trump’s “awful rhetoric” would put reporters in danger. “When we see people booing journalists at rallies, when we see the death threats that come in over social media, it's all part of this hate movement,” Stelter argued.</p>, <p>When a deranged man – who had no political motivations – shot and killed five employees at the Annapolis Capital-Gazette in Maryland, Stelter immediately turned the beam toward Trump. “There's been a sharp rise in threats against journalists in recent years. .... Which just reinforces why it's important to call out this dark strain of anti-media sentiment, apart from the attack in Annapolis.”</p>, <p>So critics of the press – which includes him – were fueling mass murders? Does that mean that the relentless criticism of Donald Trump as a democracy-killing authoritarian could be endangering <em>his</em> safety?</p>, <p>It never seems to occur to the Stelters on the media scene that perhaps “awful rhetoric” against Republicans might be a problem. The crazed leftist who shot at Republican congressmen during a baseball practice – almost killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise – listed “The Rachel Maddow Show,” “Real Time with Bill Maher” and the radical left public radio show “Democracy Now” as his favorites.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Do we then blame MSNBC or HBO or Brian Stelter for the shooting? According to the media’s own rules, that’s exactly what should happen. Perhaps it’s time for those in our Fourth Estate to blather less about criticism of the press and start shining some light on the numerous vicious attacks against pro-Trump and conservative Americans coming from their own ranks.</p>, <p>Because democracy dies in darkness, you know.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/b/l-brent-bozell-iii""><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM L.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">It’s <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/bishop-faces-backlash-after-tweet-about-pride-month"" target=""_blank"">LGBT Pride month</a> and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising, its impetus. For the gay community, this is a chance to have a good time, but also to be “out,” which is an important part of reminding our fellow Americans that we are their family members, neighbors, coworkers, and friends.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">This movement began on June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. The New York police made it a habit to raid clubs frequented by gays and lesbians, pulling them into the street, beating and arresting them.</p>, <p>On June 28, riots began as the gay community in <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york"" target=""_blank"">New York</a> had enough of being arrested simply because of who they were. From the suffrage movement in the 19th and 20th centuries as women took action and organized for the right to vote, to the black civil rights movement defined by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.‘s iconic speech longing for the time when his children would be defined by the content of their character, the civil rights movements were manifestations of the most basic demand to be treated as Americans, not as a sliver of our identity.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-tweets-in-support-of-lgbt-people-to-mark-pride-month"" target=""_blank""><strong>TRUMP TWEETS IN SUPPORT OF LGBT PEOPLE TO MARK PRIDE MONTH</strong></a></p>, <p>Fifty years after Stonewall, President Trump just became the first Republican president to talk about the celebratory month in public remarks. He did so on Twitter saying, “As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation, let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals.... on the basis of their sexual orientation. My Administration has launched a global campaign to decriminalize homosexuality and invite all nations to join us in this effort!”</p>, <p>Here the president is referring to another first, something any U.S. president could have done but did not. The Trump administration is launching a global campaign to end the criminalization of homosexuality in dozens of nations where it's still illegal to be gay, U.S. officials tell NBC News… U.S. Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, the highest-profile openly gay person in the Trump administration, is leading the effort, which kicks off Tuesday evening in Berlin. NBC News reports that the U.S. embassy is ""flying in LGBT activists from across Europe for a strategy dinner to plan to push for decriminalization in places that still outlaw homosexuality — mostly concentrated in the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.”</p>, <p>None of this seems to matter, however, to Trump’s critics. There will always be disagreements about actions taken by the federal government and its impact on our lives, but from the beginning of his administration, everything the president does has been cast as the beginning of the end of the world.</p>, <p>In cases of protecting people of faith from over-reaching government, or conforming to existing law and court decisions, the freewheeling accusation is that Trump is “attacking gay civil rights.” But we are living in a time when assigning the worst possible motives to people who disagree or have a different point of view is standard operating procedure. The Democrats are now finding the more unfair and vicious you are, people will take you less seriously.</p>, <p>This Pride month reminds us of the political left's desire to manipulate the community into a political cauldron of rage, anger, and hate. It’s a shameful twisting of a month of celebration meant to bring us together. Of course, we won’t agree with everything politicians do, but to cast people who disagree or challenge the liberal dogma as “haters”?</p>, <p>A tweet from Cher, someone whom I’ve admired, unfortunately, highlights just how unhinged some people have become. At about 1 a.m. on June 1st, after the president’s tweets about Gay Pride month, the singer tweeted this bizarre warning:</p>, <p>“Trump’s 1st Republican Pres.2 Acknowledge LGBT Pride Month. IF trump WINS 2020, HE’LL BE 1ST 2 STRIP U OF’ALL’PROTECTIONS, &amp; PUT U IN INTERNMENT CAMPS!! HE’LL PUT HIS [HAND IMAGE] ON UR SHOULDER &amp; STICK HIS [KNIFE IMAGE] IN UR BACK. [PRAYER IMAGE] WAKE UP &amp; SMELL PAIN, HIS BASE WANTS U GONE [SKULL IMAGE].”</p>, <p>If the goal for all Americans is to find solutions to our issues, one would think to have a sympathetic president in a political party long thought hostile to the gay community, would be seen as an opportunity to influence and have an even more productive impact.</p>, <p>But that can’t be the case when identity politics are meant to simply keep you isolated and fraudulently reliant on only certain types of politicians. This is why Cher, and so many others, are panicking. With identity politics, the stakes always become more extreme because people become inured to the constant, and ridiculous, hysteria.</p>, <p>Cher tells her fan base Donald Trump wants to put gays in internment camps. That he wants to murder them. She wants her fans, gay and straight, to “smell pain,” and that this business magnate from New York that everyone has known for years, wants gay people dead.</p>, <p>What is she so afraid of? Oh yeah, the collapse of the liberal narrative, reliant on the scourge of identity politics, collapsing. This is why there is such a panic. To protect politicians like Hillary and Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party which gave the nation “The Defense of Marriage Act,” and “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” two of the most damaging acts to gay civil rights in our era.</p>, <p>Odd how they remain heroes to the same people screaming Trump wants to kill the gays.</p>, <p>We’re still waiting for the Never-Trumper and our smug moral superior Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney to apologize to Ambassador Grenell for his treatment of him when Grenell was on his campaign team in 2012. Romney folded to actual homophobes and asked Grenell to spend his time on the campaign in a virtual closet. A shockingly unacceptable and insulting request, Grenell instead resigned and was appointed by Trump four years later to a position worthy of his experience. And one which he carries out in public, not silenced, and with pride.</p>, <p>The simple bottom line is this: The left recognizes having a supportive Republican president is damaging to their false narrative that the gay community ‘belongs’ to the Democrats. This is why identity politics is so important to them; they have worked hard to convince people that those who may disagree with you on certain issues are your enemy. They’re “homophobes,“ or “haters,” or want you in a camp and dead.</p>, <p>All of that is a lie. But boy, they sure want you to think Donald Trump is the enemy as Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney prance around nodding in agreement.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>We won’t agree on everything with every politician but during this Pride Month for 2019, in this 21st century, it’s time we really embrace the gifts the civil rights era gave to all of us: a confidence in our demand to not be treated differently because of who we are. To engage with everyone to make a difference. To remind our neighbors we are their family and have the same concerns they do. And a refusal to accept a system that hobbles us with fraud of fear, division, suspicion, anger and isolation.</p>, <p>There’s a desperation on the left to keep us divided.

Instead, as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has shown, they can win politically by delivering clean air and water programs that improve peoples’ quality of life.

Polls have him at 60 percent or above, the highest in more than a decade for anyone holding that office.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-deal-could-have-dems-facing-blue-collar-backlash-at-polls-some-say"" target=""_blank"">AOC'S GREEN NEW DEAL COULD HAVE DEMS FACING BLUE-COLLAR BACKLASH AT POLLS, SOME SAY</a></p>, <p>As a recent Mason Dixon<a href=""https://www.floridadaily.com/ron-desantis-in-excellent-shape-in-latest-mason-dixon-poll/%20%C2%A0%C2%A0""> poll </a>revealed, DeSantis scores well not only with Republicans but also with Democrats.</p>, <p>How has he done it? Partly by tackling full-force the algae blooms that garnered nationwide attention when they threatened Florida’s waters and economy. DeSantis created a top-drawer task force of environmental academics to study the toxic blue-green slime, put more effort behind monitoring the state’s water management procedures, vowed to oppose offshore drilling, allocated funds for cleaning up existing blooms, and promised a host of other measures including creating a 17,000 acre Everglades reservoir.</p>, <p>The aggressive commitment is working for him, and for the people of Florida. There’s a lesson there.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>Millennial voters want action on climate change. They won’t be impressed by rational debates on the topic, or cost-benefit analyses. They don’t care that China spews more pollution into the air than the U.S. and Europe combined, or that Beijing is still building coal-powered plants despite its empty promises to clean up its act. They are unimpressed that the U.S. is one of the few developed nations that has lowered emissions, because of the increased use of natural gas.</p>, <p>None of those facts damp the fervor of young voters. The GOP has to have an answer, or several answers, that focus the debate away from futuristic projections of sea changes or rising temperatures and instead on achievable, pragmatic solutions to existing environmental challenges that do not undermine our energy industries (which give U.S. producers an important competitive advantage) or our way of life.</p>, <p>For example: Republicans should attack the dumping of plastic into the oceans. Or, promise to follow through on the government’s long-stalled plan to dispose of <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">nuclear waste</a>. Or campaign on making sure every American has access to safe drinking water. Each region has individual issues, but some appeal nationally.</p>, <p>Like, for instance, cleaning up the oceans. The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>As Americans head to the beach this summer, they will find evidence of this blight; plastic floating in the sea off Cape Cod, fish that have swallowed parts of straws or other bits of garbage in the Great Lakes, water bottles washed up on Santa Monica Beach. This is a nationwide, indeed, a global problem.</p>, <p>The Ocean Conservancy reports that “every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) equates 8 million metric tons to the weight of 90 aircraft carriers.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation.</p>, <p>Plastic does not decompose; it just piles up. It does, however, break down into tiny bits called microplastics, generally smaller than 5 mm, which can end up in fish or other seas creatures we eat. The Conservancy says that 60 percent of seabirds and 100 percent of sea turtle varieties have plastic in their systems, having mistaken straws and other items for food.</p>, <p>While some plastic sinks to the ocean floor, some floats and can gather into large areas of debris. The largest “dump” of plastic garbage is found between Hawaii and California, in the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). The “patch” is estimated to cover a surface area of 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly three times the size of France. A group called Ocean Cleanup <a href=""https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/"">calculates</a> there are more than 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the dump, weighing an estimated 80,000 metric tons. </p>, <p>Attacking this pollution of our waterways is important, and would be popular.</p>, <p>Similarly, candidates should campaign on safely burying our nation’s nuclear waste in the Yucca Mountain site selected by Congress in 1987 but stalled for political reasons by the Obama administration in 2015. As Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">wrote</a> recently in the Wall Street Journal, the Yucca site sits on 8,400 square miles of U.S.-owned land, an area bigger than the state of Massachusetts. It has been determined that our nuclear leftovers could be safely buried there for at least one million years. </p>, <p>Moving forward on secure disposal might smooth the path for nuclear energy, which today supplies, as Barrasso points out, 60 percent of our carbon-free energy, or “more than three times the energy produced by wind and more than 18 times the amount from solar.” We cannot be serious about addressing climate change unless we welcome increased nuclear power.</p>, <p>After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation, and an important challenge, which Republicans would do well to embrace.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Climate and environment are not the same.

This is worth noting because his dilemma is a poignant example of why America really can’t come together behind honest solutions.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Last Sunday, CNN host Jake Tapper pushed Booker on his show ""State of the Union,"" to explain what he would do to stop a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime"">murderer</a> like the one who struck in Virginia Beach, killing at least 12 people last Friday.</p>, <p>“You said yesterday that mass shootings in America ‘cannot just go on in our country.’ And you have unveiled a comprehensive gun-reform plan,” Tapper said. “Now, ATF says that the two weapons used in the attack were handguns, not semiautomatic assault rifles. They say that they were purchased legally. How would your plan have stopped this tragedy, if at all?”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ilhan-omar-slammed-nra-virginia-shooting""><strong>ILHAN OMAR SLAMMED FOR BLAMING NRA FOR VIRGINIA SHOOTING THAT LEFT 12 PEOPLE DEAD</strong></a></p>, <p>Booker knew he couldn’t be honest without hurting his chances in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, so he tried to sidestep the important question with generalities. “This is a tragedy today,” he said, “but you know that every single day in the United States of America, in the aggregate, we have mass shootings that go on in neighborhoods like mine….”</p>, <p>Tapper soon said, “I’m sorry to interrupt, but you keep saying, ‘We’re not helpless.’ So, I’m saying: What would have prevented this tragedy?”</p>, <p>Booker just continued to evade the question. Part of the reason for the obvious dodge was that none of Booker’s (or other Democrat’s) proposals would have stopped this murderer, as the killer’s handguns had been purchased legally and there is no red flag, at least that’s now publicly known, that would have put this man on law enforcement’s or public health official’s radars.</p>, <p>But Booker likely also has trouble answering because he knows that the honesty he expressed just a few years ago would hurt him politically today.</p>, <p>“Listen to me, the people dying in Chicago, the people dying in Newark are not being done with law-abiding gun owners. We do not need to go after the guns. A law-abiding, mentally stable American, that’s not America’s problem,” said Senator Cory Booker in 2012.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The deeply-rooted narrative from the left that American gun owners and their guns are a public-health problem has made honesty impossible for politicians who hope to win in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.</p>, <p>Clearly, he was aware then—and likely still is now—that American freedom is not a problem that needs to be solved.</p>, <p>Booker can’t be honest today because he knows that Democrat primary voters have only been fed one narrative on guns for a long time. He knows that voters who only read publications like the New York Times and who only watch networks like CNN have no trouble adhering to a one-sided, ideologically anti-gun opinion—and feeling morally superior for it.</p>, <p>Booker must also know, based on his previous statements, that the left’s ideological push for gun control is treating law-abiding American gun owners as if they are the cause of evil, instead of the actual criminals or those with serious mental-health issues. He then must also be aware that this tactic pits one segment of the American citizenry against the other—those who choose not to own or carry firearms against the 100 million or more who do—for no good reason.</p>, <p>The shocking truth of it is, if the Democrats running for president would only be as honest as Booker used to be, we’d have a much better chance of coming together behind actual solutions. We could come up with better ways to find and treat those with potentially violent mental-health issues. We could find and build on honest policies to break up the cycle of inner-city gang violence. We could continue to empower more good, law-abiding Americans to carry concealed so they can act even more often as a line of defense against the rare and random mass-killers.</p>, <p>To stay in step with the current mainstream-media narrative, Booker also told Tapper: “This is a uniquely American problem. We have carnage in our country at levels that no other nation sees.”</p>, <p>That statement isn’t just misinformation, it is completely false. Many other nations have higher murder rates per capita than the U.S. Even if Booker was only referring to mass murders, he’d be wrong. Last year John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, debunked a study that many on the anti-gun left cite to make this false claim.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>What is happening is that the deeply-rooted narrative from the left that American gun owners and their guns are a public-health problem has made honesty impossible for politicians who hope to win in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.</p>, <p>In the process, they are also making real solutions impossible to achieve – and that is the most unfortunate thing of all.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/frank-miniter""><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FRANK MINITER</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All you have to do is make wildly unrealistic promises and blame rich people for the world’s problems.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">After that, most of the left-wing media will fawn all over you for your “revolutionary” and “innovative” thinking—no matter how foolish the policy proposal might be.</p>, <p>Sanders’ <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders"">newest idea</a> is to have government build “millions” of new housing units to help improve access to “affordable” housing.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jeanne-allen-american-education-is-in-crisis-and-bernie-sanders-is-not-helping""><strong>JEANNE ALLEN: WE ARE AT WAR. THE BATTLEGROUND IS THE CLASSROOM. AND BERNIE SANDERS JUST DOESN'T GET IT</strong></a></p>, <p>“When I talk about infrastructure, I’ll tell you what else I’m talking about: The need to build millions of new units of affordable housing,” Sanders said at a rally on Wednesday in Reno, Nevada. “All over this country, you have people paying 40, 50, 60 percent of their limited incomes in housing. That is absurd. Let’s put people to work, with good wages, to build the affordable housing this country needs.”</p>, <p>There’s no denying housing and rent prices are high in some parts of the United States, especially in many high-tax cities, where developers are forced—usually by Democratic Party-led governments—to pay exorbitant fees and comply with mountains of red tape to build new housing units, if they are allowed to do so at all. But saying the best solution to bringing down housing costs is to build millions of new houses is utterly ridiculous for several important reasons.</p>, <p><strong>First, there are already millions of vacant homes and apartments available across the country.</strong> Adding millions of new buildings would make it even harder for those looking to sell their homes or apartments to find buyers or tenants.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Sanders suggests that one of the benefits of his proposal would be that it would help “put people to work,” but in reality, it would merely take money away from other parts of the economy in the form of taxation and force people to pay for something the market is already providing.</p>, <p><strong>Second, there is absolutely no money available for another massive, costly government program. </strong>The federal government is expected to run a $900 billion deficit this fiscal year, and the national government is currently $22 trillion in debt. Even if we assume by “millions” of new housing units that Sanders means just three million new housing units, his plan would likely cost more than $300 billion (assuming a conservative figure of $100,000 per housing unit)—more than one-third of the budget deficit recorded in the 2017–18 fiscal year.</p>, <p><strong>Third, it’s a fallacy to say these new homes would be “affordable.”</strong> Although Sanders’ plan would reduce housing prices for some lower-income people, it would require raising taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars to cover the expenses. Contrary to the seemingly popular belief in the Democratic Party, money doesn’t simply fall from the sky.</p>, <p>Even if the revenues required are taken only from the wealthiest Americans and businesses, it’s extremely likely everyone would be forced to pay much of the costs in the form of higher prices for goods and services imposed by businesses and business owners to offset losses. There’s absolutely no reason to believe wealthy individuals and businesses will choose to pay higher taxes without passing along their costs through higher prices.</p>, <p>Further, other Democratic presidential candidates and Sanders have already called for creating dozens of other new government programs that would also require hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars in new tax revenues. For example, the Green New Deal, which Sanders co-sponsored in the Senate, would cost tens of trillions of dollars in just the first decade. America’s billionaires literally do not have enough money to pay for even half the cost of the Green New Deal in just the first 10 years, so how does Sanders expect them to pay for this policy program too?</p>, <p><strong>Fourth, rather than encourage people to move out of poverty, Sanders’ plan would incentivize Americans to remain impoverished. </strong>If you knew you could get access to brand-new housing for a fraction of its market price by remaining in poverty, why would you try to move out of poverty?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p><strong>Fifth, Sanders suggested that one of the benefits of his proposal would be that it would help “put people to work,” but in reality, it would merely take money away from other parts of the economy in the form of taxation and force people to pay for something the market is already providing. </strong>So, while some parts of the economy would be improved by Sanders’ plan, numerous other parts would be greatly harmed in the process, and the net impact on the total economy would be negative, because hundreds of billions that could have been spent to innovate and expand businesses would be wasted on building new houses.</p>, <p>There’s nothing indicating America needs a huge new public housing plan, but that doesn’t matter to Sanders, whose only two interests are dramatically expanding the size and power of government and winning the presidency in 2020.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/justin-haskins""><strong>CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Ocasio-Cortez of New York that his record on tackling climate change was “middle of the road.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-room-for-moderates-aoc-sanders-wing-goes-on-attack-against-2020-centrists""><strong>BIDEN COMES UNDER ATTACK BY 2020 DEMOCRATIC RIVALS</strong></a></p>, <p>Biden’s campaign, in spelling out the plan, said that the Green New Deal “captures two basic truths” – that the nation “urgently needs to embrace greater ambition on an epic scale to meet the scope of this challenge,” and that the environment and the country’s economy “are completely and totally connected.”</p>, <p>The Green New Deal, co-authored by Ocasio-Cortez, is a sweeping proposal introduced in Congress earlier this year that aims to transform the country’s economy to combat climate change while enacting a host of new welfare programs.</p>, <p>The Biden campaign said the former vice president’s plan would ensure that the U.S. achieves a 100 percent clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emission no later than 2050. And they said that if elected president, on his first day in office Biden would sign a series of executive orders “with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track.”</p>, <p>Other parts of the plan include demanding Congress pass a bill in Biden’s first year in the White House that includes milestone targets no later than 2025, make an historic investment in clear energy, climate research and innovation, and “incentivize the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations across the economy.”</p>, <p>The campaign spotlighted that Biden would not only immediately recommit the U.S. to the Paris Agreements on climate change – reversing actions taken by Trump – but would also “rally the rest of the world to meet the threat of climate change.”</p>, <p>The campaign also said that a Biden administration would take action against fossil fuel companies and others “who put profit over people and knowingly harm our environment and poison our communities’ air, land, and water, or conceal information regarding potential environmental and health risks.”</p>, <p>And Biden, long a friend to organized labor, would vow “not to leave any workers or communities left behind” as the nation transforms to a clean energy economy.</p>, <p>Climate change is a top issue in the race for the Democratic nomination, with a number of Biden’s rivals in the historically enormous field of 24 candidates releasing their own plans to tackle climate change.</p>, <p>Last month, Biden past efforts in combating climate change were criticized by Ocasio-Cortez. She tweeted that Biden’s upcoming climate plan “is a dealbreaker. There is no 'middle ground' w/ climate denial &amp; delay.”</p>, <p>A day later, at an event in support of the Green New Deal, she took aim again. Without mentioning the former vice president by name, Ocasio-Cortez highlighted that “if the same politicians who refused to act then are going to try to come back today and say we need to have a ‘middle of the road approach’ to save our lives, that is too much for me.”</p>, <p>Campaigning soon after in New Hampshire, Biden responded.</p>, <p>“You never heard me say ‘middle of the road.’ I’ve never been middle-of-the-road on the environment. Tell her.. to look at my record. She’ll find that nobody has been more consistent about taking on the environment and a green revolution than I have,” he spotlighted during a gaggle with reporters.</p>, <p><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>And pushing back against his critics, he noted that “this is a long campaign and everybody should just calm down a little bit and take a look at the record from before.”</p>, <p>Biden is back in New Hampshire on Tuesday and his campaign tells Fox News that the candidate is expected to talk more about his plan during the trip, which includes a stop at a renewable energy supplier in Plymouth.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

On defense, he threw out 13 of 27 runners attempting to steal.</p>, <p>Here are some more numbers, too: After getting drafted in the 40th round by Seattle three years ago, Rutschman is in line for a potential $8,415,300 signing bonus — the assigned slot value for this year's top pick.</p>, <p>""It's unbelievable,"" he said from Goss Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon.

Lodolo was the 41st overall pick by Pittsburgh in 2016 — the highest selection to go unsigned that year.</p>, <p>It was the first time since the draft began in 1965 that no pitchers were taken within the first six picks.</p>, <p><strong>WORTH THE TRIP</strong></p>, <p>All four prospects in attendance were selected within the first 33 picks.

Pollock.</p>, <p>Hall of Fame pitcher Randy Johnson, representing the Diamondbacks, announced the pick from the podium.</p>, <p>""That was awesome,"" a beaming Malone said.</p>, <p>Baty is from the same Texas high school that produced Cleveland Browns quarterback and 2017 Heisman Trophy winner Baker Mayfield, the top pick in last year's NFL draft.</p>, <p>After a prep playoff game Saturday night, Baty said he woke up about 3 a.m. to catch a flight to New York, where he attended the Red Sox-Yankees game Sunday night. He had a 7 a.m. flight Tuesday to head home for early afternoon baseball practice ahead of a state tournament game Friday.</p>, <p>""It's a pretty jam-packed schedule,"" he said around midnight on a Mets conference call. ""It's pretty fun, too.""</p>, <p>Someday, maybe New York will be home.</p>, <p>""I know that it's a big ol' city. The media is tough,"" Baty said. ""I'm just ready.""</p>, <p>Rutledge is from St. Louis, same as the Nationals ace he already looks up to.</p>, <p>""I want to be teammates with Max Scherzer as soon as I can,"" Rutledge said.</p>, <p><strong>DYNAMIC DUO</strong></p>, <p>The only set of teammates — college or high school — drafted in the first round came from the University of California.

""I think people know a lot more about the players that are being selected than they used to, and as a result there's a lot more interest.

""The petition involves a charge that the licensee engaged in a major misappropriation of client funds.""</p>, <p>Reached by Fox News late Monday, Avenatti responded, ""The action by the CA State Bar is nothing more than a 'pile-on' and was entirely expected in light of the pending charges. I offered to cooperate with the Bar and instead they decided to issue a press release as a stunt. I look forward to being fully exonerated by the facts.""</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">""Mr. Avenatti is the Bernie Madoff of attorneys.

      <!-- --></p>, <p>The state bar said the evidence against Avenatti was ""clear and convincing"" in the case, and that Avenatti had provided no defense or even response to the bar's investigators. The petition noted he now has 10 days to request a hearing, or will permanently waive that right.</p>, <p>The bar noted that Avenatti still owes Barela more than $700,000, and charged that Avenatti provided Barela a forged settlement agreement.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-the-media-enabled-michael-avenatti-now-accused-of-stealing-from-stormy"" target=""_blank""><strong>ANALYSIS: HOW THE MEDIA ENABLED AVENATTI</strong></a></p>, <p>""We are grateful that the California State Bar has taken action to investigate and suspend Mr. Avenatti from the practice of law,"" attorney Steven Bledsoe, who represents Barela in his civil case against Avenatti, told Fox News. ""Mr. Avenatti has stolen money from multiple clients, violated their trust, and should never be allowed to practice law again.</p>, <p>""Mr. Avenatti’s falsification of Mr. Barela’s settlement agreement and theft of his settlement money appears to be the tip of the iceberg,"" Bledsoe continued. ""We did not file the complaint with the California State Bar until we had proof that Mr. Avenatti had stolen Mr. Barela’s settlement money. Since that time, several more clients of Mr. Avenatti have discovered that he has stolen money from them also. This is a very sad situation, but we are gratified that the State Bar is pursuing the appropriate disciplinary action of suspension and disbarment.""</p>, <p>Bledsoe concluded: ""Mr. Avenatti is the Bernie Madoff of attorneys. He belongs disbarred and behind bars.""</p>, <p>In March 2018, according to the statement of claims in Barela's pending civil arbitration filing against Avenatti, Barela visited the Eagan Avenatti law firm in Newport Beach, Calif., to ask about the settlement money -- only to see two attorneys who work with Avenatti, John Arden and Ahmed Ibrahim, allegedly try to keep quiet about it.</p>, <p>""Mr. Barela saw Mr. Arden's reflection in the glass wall of the conference room and observed Mr. Arden gesturing towards Mr. Ibrahim to stop discussing Mr. Barlea's settlement payment,"" the document asserts, after which ""both Mr. Ibrahim and Mr. Arden ... actively deceived Mr. Barela by not disclosing that the settlement payment had been received.""</p>, <p>In an email dated April 5, 2018, and reviewed by Fox News, Barela wrote to Avenatti that he would ""like to discuss my options for collections"" on the settlement funds. Ten days later, Barela again sought Avenatti's advice on the ""status"" of the transfer, and ""next actions"" to take if the funds were not collected.</p>, <p>On May 7, 2018, Barela wrote that if the company ""does not pay soon,"" he might ""need a little help"" financially from Avenatti. On May 15, Barela again asked if the company had ""respond[ed] or paid."" Barela also noted in one conversation that he was planning to host a watch party at his home for an upcoming Avenatti appearance on ""60 Minutes.""</p>, <p>After several advances of funds from Avenatti, on Oct. 10, 2018, Barela wrote, ""I was hoping to have an update"" on the settlement funds and ""get our money."" He tells Avenatti, ""I need 8K by Tuesday or I'm in deep sh**,"" and on Oct. 22, he emailed a dire assessment.</p>, <p>""Michael, I was waiting for your call and I know you get busy,"" Barela wrote on Oct. 22. ""I send updates like this so you don't have to dig up old emails. I know your [sic] under pressure so let's discuss what you can or can't do? ... Just so you know I am in real financial trouble and am working on trying to get another loan. I am trying to use the [settlement] agreement to secure it. I need to know that we really have the ability to collect and timing to the best of you [sic] opinion.""</p>, <p>The email concluded by asking whether the company had ""responded"" and ""if not what is our next action.""</p>, <p>Avenatti did not disclose that he had received the wire transfer in his conversations with Barela, according to Barela's attorneys and a review of emails between Avenatti and Barela, stretching throughout most of 2018.</p>, <p>Avenatti became a household name thanks in no small part to his endless exposure on CNN and MSNBC; Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz reports.</p>, <p>At one point, Avenatti wrote to Barela, ""Let's chat in the am. Working on a solution."" In another response, Avenatti wrote only, ""Making progress,"" without elaborating.</p>, <p>In November, Gregory Barela and his wife Talitha Barela hired the law firm Larson O'Brien LLP, which was co-founded by former U.S. District Court Judge Stephen G. Larson, to demand answers. Bledsoe, a partner at the firm, told Fox News that Avenatti has since gone silent  -- and that he has the documents to prove wrongdoing.</p>, <p>Avenatti has ""refused to provide an accounting concerning the settlement funds,"" as required by California law, Bledsoe said. ""Mr. Avenatti has had two months to answer the simple question of whether he received the initial settlement payment for Mr. Barela and he has refused to answer. In the meantime, the settling party has provided us with wire-transfer confirmations showing that they made the settlement payment into Mr. Avenatti’s client trust account, at Mr. Avenatti’s direction.""</p>, <p>Avenatti has separately been arraigned on charges that he stole nearly $300,000 from adult film actress Stormy Daniels, the client who <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnns-brian-stelter-defends-avenatti-coverage-his-past-praise-as-a-2020-contender"" target=""_blank"">rocketed him to national prominence</a>. He was also arraigned on charges that he tried to extort up to $25 million from athletic apparel giant Nike by threatening to expose claims that the shoemaker paid off high school basketball players to steer them to Nike-sponsored colleges.</p>, <p>In the Nike case, Avenatti is charged with one count of extortion, one count of sending interstate communications with intent to extort and two counts of conspiracy. In the Stormy Daniels case, he is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft.</p>, <p>If convicted on all counts, Avenatti faces more than 300 years in prison.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Trump vow dramatic action on border crisis; Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward reacts.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Washington, D.C., district court Judge Trevor McFadden threw out <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-files-suit-against-trump-administration-over-emergency-declaration"" target=""_blank"">House Democrats' lawsuit</a> seeking an injunction against President Trump's emergency border wall funding reallocation, saying that the matter is fundamentally a political dispute and that the politicians lack standing to make a legal case.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Trump had <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-eyes-8b-border-wall-funding-emergency-declaration"" target=""_blank"">declared a national emergency</a> this past February over the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, following Congress' failure to fund his border wall legislatively. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and House Democrats then filed suit in April, charging that Trump was ""stealing from appropriated funds” by moving $6.7 billion from other projects toward border wall construction.</p>, <p>Democrats argued that the White House had ""flouted the fundamental separation-of-powers principles and usurped for itself legislative power specifically vested by the Constitution in Congress.""</p>, <p>But, in <a href=""https://www.lawfareblog.com/judge-rules-house-doesnt-have-standing-border-lawsuit"" target=""_blank"">his ruling</a><a href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6128249/House-v-Mnuchin-opinion.pdf"">,</a> McFadden, a Trump appointee, suggested Democrats were trying to circumvent the political process.</p>, <p>""This case presents a close question about the appropriate role of the Judiciary in resolving disputes between the other two branches of the Federal Government. To be clear, the court does not imply that Congress may never sue the Executive to protect its powers,"" McFadden <a href=""https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6128249/House-v-Mnuchin-opinion.pdf"">wrote in his opinion</a>. ""The Court declines to take sides in this fight between the House and the President.""</p>, <p>McFadden's ruling contrasted with <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-temporarily-blocks-trumps-border-wall-construction-plans"" target=""_blank"">U.S. District Court Judge Haywood Gilliam’s injunction last week</a>, which blocked the administration from using the reallocated funds for projects in specific areas in Texas and Arizona. Gilliam had been appointed by then-President Barack Obama.</p>, <p>McFadden began by focusing on two guiding Supreme Court cases he called ""lodestars""-- the 2015 case Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, and the 1997 case Raines v. Byrd.</p>, <p>Border Patrol has picked up the migrants caught on this tape.</p>, <p>""Read together, Raines and Arizona State Legislature create a spectrum of sorts,"" McFadden wrote. ""On one end, individual legislators lack standing to allege a generalized harm to Congress’s Article I power. On the other end, both chambers of a state legislature do have standing to challenge a nullification of their legislative authority brought about through a referendum.""</p>, <p>But, McFadden quickly distinguished the Arizona State Legislature case, which found institutional standing for legislators only in a limited instance. The Arizona case, the judge noted, ""does not touch or concern the question whether Congress has standing to bring a suit against the President,"" and the Supreme Court has found there was ""no federal analogue to Arizona’s initiative power.""</p>, <p>Democrats' dispute was more similar to the one in the Raines case, McFadden wrote. Under the framework and factors considered in Raines -- including how similar matters have been handled historically, and the availability of other remedies besides litigation -- McFadden ruled that House Democrats lacked standing.</p>, <p>Concerning past historical practice, the Trump administration argued in its brief that when Congress was concerned about ""unauthorized Executive Branch spending in the aftermath of World War I, it responded not by threatening litigation, but by creating the General Accounting Office."" The judge cited that argument approvingly in his opinion, calling it ""persuasive.""</p>, <p>Examples of hotly debated political questions being resolved without involving the courts, McFadden continued, ""abound"" throughout history.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/we-build-wall-starts-construction-border-texas"" target=""_blank""><strong>PRIVATELY FUNDED BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION BEGINS IN EL PASO</strong></a></p>, <p>For example, McFadden wrote, in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ""fired an official from his Senate-confirmed position at the Federal Trade Commission. ...The President removed the official without providing a reason. ... The Senate likely had a 'strong[] claim of diminution of' its Advice and Consent power. ... Yet the Senate made no effort to challenge this action in court.""</p>, <p>Additionally, McFadden said Democrats retained constitutional legislative options with which to remedy their objections about the president's purported misuse of the Appropriations Clause. Under Supreme Court precedent in the Raines case, McFadden asserted, the existence of those additional options suggested Democrats lacked standing.</p>, <p>McFadden noted in particular that Democrats retained the power to modify or even repeal the appropriations law if they wanted to ""exempt future appropriations"" from the Trump administration's reach.</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>Because the White House had not ""nullified"" that legislative power, McFadden wrote, there was no urgent need for judicial intervention sufficient to override the considerations of the political question doctrine, which holds that courts generally stay out of politically sensitive matters best left to voters.</p>, <p>""Congress has several political arrows in its quiver to counter perceived threats to its sphere of power,"" McFadden wrote. ""These tools show that this lawsuit is not a last resort for the House. And this fact is also exemplified by the many other cases across the country challenging the administration's planned construction of the border wall.""</p>, <p>McFadden continued: ""The House retains the institutional tools necessary to remedy any harm caused to this power by the Administration’s actions. Its Members can, with a two-thirds majority, override the President’s veto of the resolution voiding the National Emergency Declaration. They did not. It can amend appropriations laws to expressly restrict the transfer or spending of funds for a border wall under Sections 284 and 2808. Indeed, it appears to be doing so.""</p>, <p>The judge added that House Democrats had the burden of demonstrating that they had standing -- a difficult hurdle for any plaintiff to clear, which involves showing a particularized injury that the court can address.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-escalating-illegal-immigrants-stop"" target=""_blank"">TRUMP ANNOUNCES ESCALATING TARIFFS ON MEXICO UNTIL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 'STOP'</a></strong></p>, <p>To that end, McFadden quoted former Chief Justice John Marshall's opinion in the seminal 1803 case Marbury v. Madison, in which Marshall wrote, the ""province of the [C[ourt is, solely, to decide on the rights of individuals, not to enquire how the executive, or executive officers, perform duties in which they have a discretion.""</p>, <p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro says Mexico exports illegal aliens and it’s time to tax them.</p>, <p>McFadden also wrote, quoting from another Supreme Court case, ""Intervening in a contest between the House and President over the border wall would entangle the Court 'in a power contest nearly at the height of its political tension' and would 'risk damaging the public confidence that is vital to the functioning of the Judicial Branch.'""</p>, <p>Lawmakers expressly approved only $1.375 billion in the weeks after the shutdown, to go toward funding to 55 miles of wall along the southern border. But, Trump said that was inadequate, and he pushed ahead by moving funds from other Homeland Security projects previously approved by legislators. In <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-releases-budget-seeks-billions-more-for-border-wall-and-work-requirements-for-welfare"" target=""_blank"">his budget request earlier this year</a>, Trump formally requested another $8.6 billion from Congress, saying that would be sufficient to build more than 700 miles of wall.</p>, <p>The emergency-appropriated funding alone could be used to build more than 230 miles of barriers.</p>, <p>At a hearing in May, McFadden hinted that courts should stay out of the matter -- and suggested an appeal was imminent regardless.</p>, <p>""I’m not sure how much necessarily our views will carry the day for the courts above us,"" McFadden said at the hearing.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Disagreement already has been brewing in the lower courts, setting the stage for appellate panels to step in. Gillam, the Northern District of California judge who ruled last month that Trump was likely breaking the law by reallocating the wall funds, blocked some projects slated for immediate construction in Yuma and El Paso.</p>, <p>""In short, the position that when Congress declines the Executive’s request to appropriate funds, the Executive nonetheless may simply find a way to spend those funds without Congress does not square with fundamental separation of powers principles dating back to the earliest days of our Republic,"" Gilliam wrote.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p>The New York Times had reportedly <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nyt-bans-reporters-maddow-lemon-cnn-msnbc-report"" target=""_blank"">blocked its reporters</a> from appearing on “Maddow” because the program is too partisan, with one insider from the Grey Lady's newsroom agreeing, telling Fox News “it rubs off” on any journalist who is too closely aligned to the far left.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nyt-bans-reporters-maddow-lemon-cnn-msnbc-report"" target=""_blank"">NEW YORK TIMES BANS REPORTERS FROM CNN'S DON LEMON, MSNBC'S MADDOW SHOWS FOR BEING 'TOO PARTISAN:' REPORT</a></strong></p>, <p>“I do think Maddow, and others on MSNBC, have very strong opinions that affect their ability to tell stories in an accurate way sometimes,” the source said. “You don’t get tainted just by appearing [on the show], but it’s better to err on the side of trying to maintain objectivity and caution.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">“You don’t get tainted just by appearing [‘The Rachel Maddow Show’], but it’s better to err on the side of trying to maintain objectivity and caution.”</p>, <p>The insider said colleagues at the paper are divided as to whether or not appearing on Maddow’s show would actually damage their reputations. Many of the Times’ top reporters are aware and “rightly sensitive” about the paper’s reputation of leaning left, the source said, and appearing on “Maddow” makes it hard to convince people otherwise.</p>, <p>A handful of journalists work for the both the Times and MSNBC, including Peter Baker, Nick Confessore and Jeremy Peters. All three of those reporters declined to comment when individually asked about Maddow. The Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment, either.</p>, <p>The paper did tell Vanity Fair that it was simply reinforcing an existing policy to be consistent with the paper’s standards. But Peters appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, the morning after the news of a Times reporter being kept off Maddow broke. “Morning Joe” hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough have a public feud with Trump, but haven’t pushed the Russia collusion theory as aggressively as Maddow.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/unmasked-book-ranks-the-media-members-who-hate-president-trump-from-jim-acosta-to-mika-brzezinski"" target=""_blank"">‘UNMASKED’ BOOK RANKS MEDIA MEMBERS WHO HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP THE MOST, FROM JIM ACOSTA TO MIKA BRZEZINSKI</a></strong></p>, <p>Maddow has dedicated much of her programming since Trump took office to hyperventilating over whether or not Trump colluded with Russia. Since Attorney General Bill Barr's letter summarizing Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released on March 24 indicating that a Trump campaign-Russia conspiracy didn’t exist, contradicting Maddow’s nightly narrative, her ratings have suffered.</p>, <p>Maddow <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rachel-maddows-suffer-after-mueller-report-determined-no-collusion"" target=""_blank"">lost nearly 500,000 viewers</a> for her first episode following the release of Barr’s letter.

In May she averaged 2.6 million – her worst month since Trump took office – and a far cry from the 3.1 million viewers she averaged during the <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/here-are-the-top-cable-news-programs-for-q1-2019/398468/"" target=""_blank"">first quarter</a> of 2019.</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>Accuracy in Media national editor Carrie Sheffield feels that Maddow has long “ignored basic journalistic, fact-checking practices and the presumption of innocence in our legal system by relentlessly pushing unproven conspiracy theories about supposed Russian collusion” and her “lapse in journalistic balance” is part of why Americans have declining trust in the national media and why some reporters appear to be distancing themselves from her show.</p>, <p>“This was a long time coming, and we hope MSNBC will allow for greater balance moving forward.

We watched it so you wouldn't have to. All three of them are Democratic members of Congress. None is in danger of becoming president anytime soon.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">So why do we pay attention to what they say? Well, because as they stammer and sweat and pander profusely, they give us a good idea of what the Democratic primary voters believe and what they care about. And of course, the thing they care about most -- a thing they can't stop talking about ever -- is race. They are obsessed in a deeply unhealthy way. Racial obsessions are always deeply unhealthy.</p>, <p>Moulton explained that Georgia didn't elect Stacey Abrams governor not because she wouldn't be a good governor, but because, you sir, are a bigot.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/tucker-carlson"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.</strong></a></p>, <p>""We have a problem with racism in American today,"" he said. ""If this country wasn't racist, Stacey Abrams would be governor. People of color are being systemically denied the most basic right in the democracy, which is the right to vote.""</p>, <p>Moulton went to Andover and Harvard, unlike you. So he must be unbelievably impressive, probably a verified genius and a good person, too. And yet, somehow Moulton didn't bother to muster a single piece of evidence to show any of his claims were true. Because actually, they're not true, because it's not 1953 anymore. They can't let you know that, though.</p>, <p>For Moulton's purposes -- purposes of control -- it has got to be Jim Crow Alabama at all times, now and forever. Burning crosses and the sound of night riders in the distance. That will keep you terrified and easier to manipulate. That is the whole point.</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE. </strong></a></p>, <p>Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to bring the South to heel.

There's a lot of young women who work at CNN that could be affected. </em></p>, <p>Do you support putting big companies in charge of America's social policy? Eric Swalwell was asked. ""Of course I support that,"" he might as well have said.

Global warming isn't actually killing millions of people right now.</p>, <p>All true statements. All of those statements drives them bonkers because they are true. Here was the response from Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is also running for president, reminded them that, actually, socialism doesn't really work.</p>, <p><em>Hickenlooper: If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer. I was re-elected -- </em></p>, <p><em>[Booing] </em></p>, <p><em>Hickenlooper: I was -- you know, if we are not careful, we are going to end up helping to re-elect the worst president in American history ... </em></p>, <p>So that is the point where Hickenlooper should have paused and called out the audience, like a standup comic, and ask them to name a single place outside of Sweden in the 1970s in which socialism has actually worked. Anyone? Anyone?</p>, <p>But of course, he didn't do that. He was too afraid. A moist-palm Democrat. God knows what the mob would have done if he tried. Watch what happened to John Delany, maybe the bravest of anyone in the race, when he suggested the Medicare-for-All might not be such a great idea:</p>, <p><em>Delaney:  Medicare-for-All may sound good, but it's actually not good policy. Nor is it good politics. I'm telling you ... I'm telling you ...</em></p>, <p><em>[Booing] </em></p>, <p>He is dying out there. ""Boo! Stop him before he hurts our dreams. If we want it to be true, it must be true,"" screamed the 4-year- olds in attendance. ""I am the center of my universe. Cater to me. Tell me I'm wonderful.""</p>, <p>If you strip it all away, that really is the message of the Democratic voters -- 200-proof narcissism. ""Give us more.""</p>, <p>The Narcissist-in-Chief was very offended. For the crime of making an obvious point, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went on Twitter and demanded that Delaney get out of the race. And that doesn't, in the end, bode well for Democrats.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Technology billionaire Robert F. Smith's gift comes with a challenge: pay it forward; Jonathan Serrie reports from Atlanta.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The saying, ""No good deed goes unpunished,"" remains an unfortunate reality for Robert F. Smith. Just a few weeks after the announcement that he, most generously, would pay off all student loan debt belonging to Morehouse College’s graduating class, the billionaire is receiving backlash from the self-appointed intellectual elites over at The <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/media"">New York Times</a>.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">“An affordable <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/college"">college education</a> should not require an act of largess,” writes The Times Editorial Board. “It should not require our applause. It merely requires adequate public investment, funded by equitable taxation.”</p>, <p>It appears a couple of those writers are just a teensy-bit angry they had to pay for their overpriced journalism degrees. Join the club! It stinks. That doesn’t mean you spout off like a spoiled brat because a man helped 396 young men at Morehouse with an estimated $40 million gift. Now, to be fair, they did credit Smith’s expenditure as “generous” to those graduates — only to deliver a nasty right hook a sentence later.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/tucker-carlson-congress-must-address-the-student-loan-debt-problem-and-stop-colleges-from-scamming-our-kids""><strong>TUCKER CARLSON: CONGRESS MUST ADDRESS THE STUDENT LOAN DEBT PROBLEM AND STOP COLLEGES FROM SCAMMING OUR KIDS</strong></a></p>, <p>""Their gratitude underscores the reality that hundreds of thousands of other members of the class of 2019 will be carrying unrelieved burdens of debt as they begin their adult lives,"" the Times wrote.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Taxation is rarely the answer, particularly when it comes to financing education. Even if there is a “free-college for all” utopia that somehow comes to fruition, there’s no guarantee that money won’t be wasted on bureaucratic nonsense.</p>, <p>So now Smith, just one man, should be guilt-shamed because he didn’t pay for the rest of 2019’s debt. Newsflash: Every class, particularly those graduating during and after the recession in 2008 have enormous student loan debt. Recently, the White House estimated that for my class, students who started college in 2004, 40 percent are projected to default on their student loans by 2023. Yes, this is a massive problem unchecked and steamrolling ahead that has and will obliterate the credit of a generation.</p>, <p>We need more individuals to step up and man-up. (Undoubtedly, a critic will lambast the lack of “intersectionality” of that expression. Too bad.) A tide of debt is engulfing America's youth.</p>, <p>The most aggravating issue when you try to explain college debt to Boomers? Nine times out of 10, they’ll respond with some variation of, ""If you can't afford it, don't go to college. We didn't."" Then please explain why your generation set up an American economy that relies so heavily on a caste system of education.</p>, <p>There are also those who belong to younger generations who immediately shut down any chance of substantive talks about student debt. It becomes the classic, selfish have or have-not debate.</p>, <p>""Go to a state school. I did.""</p>, <p>""Who needs a fancy education? Just go to work first and save.""</p>, <p>One answer to that question? Doctors. The men and women administering medicine and saving our lives. They need a fancy education. Their employment options rely on extensive schooling, similar to lawyers reliant on expensive post-graduate degrees.</p>, <p>Often the ""best"" schools cost more money. Should a student turn down acceptance into George Washington Law (ranked 22nd in the nation according to U.S. News &amp; World Report) because it costs too much? The better the school, the better the law firm, and hence the more lucrative long-term career earnings. But we simultaneously straddle those students in never-ending interest payments because they dared excel.</p>, <p>If you refuse to recognize there’s a problem, you've turned your back on the prosperity of your peers and your country. We’ve seen government bailouts for the banking and housing markets, and that’s where we’re headed if we fail to figure out a solution to education debt.</p>, <p>Lower the federal interest rates first. Delineate the power of these money-making admissions and university front offices and push for programs that advocate different paths, like trade schools, when needed. The New York Times can rail as much as it wants on taxation loopholes and how Smith benefited from that with his private equity firm, but the bottom line is this: Smith donated big-time on his own.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>Taxation is rarely the answer, particularly when it comes to financing education. Even if there is a “free-college for all” utopia that somehow comes to fruition, there’s no guarantee that money won’t be wasted on bureaucratic nonsense.</p>, <p>Encourage the private sector as Robert F. Smith so magnanimously did with his contribution. Individuals giving back, with incentives to do so, will continue to feed a pay-it-back system. And lay off the hater-ade.

We cannot even imagine the number of “get aways” we haven’t caught.</p>, <p>It is anticipated that the number of people apprehended in 2019 will exceed 1,000,000 illegal border crossers. The number is staggering when you realize that the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/immigration/illegal-immigrants"" target=""_blank"">illegal population</a> caught this year alone could almost rank as one of the 10 largest U.S. cities.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/reps-roy-jordan-biggs-cloud-pelosi-democrats-immigration-migrant-children"" target=""_blank"">REPS. ROY, JORDAN, BIGGS: PELOSI, DEMS JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR NATIONAL EMERGENCY</a></strong></p>, <p>Failure to stop this rate of mass migration means every few years more illegal immigrants than Chicago has residents, and almost as many as our nation’s second largest city, Los Angeles, will stream into our country.</p>, <p>That influx means that in three years the population of those here illegally would be the equivalent of more than six congressional districts.</p>, <p>And, that’s counting only the number of people we catch!</p>, <p>That doesn’t account for the more than 1 million legal migrants every year.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">When Congress talks about any kind of amnesty, including DACA amnesty, we see a surge on the border. When President Trump announced a stringent policy early in his administration, we experienced a sharp decline in illegal border crossings.</p>, <p>Congress considered a bill last week that would provide amnesty to millions who are in the country illegally and have successfully avoided removal to their home country.</p>, <p>At the same time, the number of people who enter illegally and demand asylum is overrunning our border facilities. Border enforcement agents spend more than half of their time providing humanitarian services. While agents are overwhelmed with these nontraditional functions, cartels are smuggling drugs and other more dangerous people into the country.</p>, <p>Our policies, created by inattentive legislators, politically motivated judges, and bureaucratic stasis, has provided an array of incentives for illegal immigrants to come into the country. When Congress talks about any kind of amnesty, including DACA amnesty, we see a surge on the border. When President Trump announced a stringent policy early in his administration, we experienced a sharp decline in illegal border crossings.</p>, <p>Now, however, the word is out that American courts have ruled that the president’s hands are tied, and what do we see? A massive influx of well-informed illegal immigrants, coached by Mexican criminal cartels on how to claim asylum. They have overrun the system to such an extent that CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have no place to keep them. CBP and ICE are releasing hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants into the United States.</p>, <p>CBP agents should be trained to become asylum officers and given authority for expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can narrow the number of those here illegally who can work in the U.S. while awaiting court proceedings. DHS should limit the number of illegal immigrants eligible for parole from custody. Considering that most who claim asylum have paid human traffickers $8,000 to $11,000, DHS should impose fees for asylum applications and for employment authorization. Fraudulent asylum applicants should be punished and removed immediately.</p>, <p>DHS should also fully implement the “Remain in Mexico” policy and the administration should leverage the Mexican government to enter into a safe third-party agreement which would allow the U.S. to remove someone here illegally to a safe country rather than being turned loose for years and years into America.</p>, <p>DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) should issue final rules to terminate the 9th Circuit-created Flores settlement that has impeded our ability to detain illegal immigrants and acts as a magnet for more people to cross illegally into America.</p>, <p>In April 2019 alone, it was found that more than 25 percent of those claiming to be a family unit did so fraudulently. New family unit rules would help negate the fraud resulting from the Flores rules. Currently, Flores facilitates the exploitation of children by criminal cartels. DHS and HHS must create new rules.</p>, <p>We should deploy many immigration judges to speed up the asylum process. But, remember that about 3,500 illegal immigrants, most claiming asylum, are entering the U.S. every day.

Every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/adam-schiff-robert-mueller-testify-congress""><strong>ADAM SCHIFF: ROBERT MUELLER SHOULD STILL TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ON RUSSIA INVESTIGATION</strong></a></p>, <p>Moments later, Mueller said about President Trump and allegations (mostly by Democrats and the media) that he obstructed justice: ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">At some point, many voters are going to look at this as persecution of the president, which can only add to his prospects in 2020.</p>, <p>So it’s innocent until proven guilty for the Russians, who are never going to be tried in the United States, and an insinuation of guilt until he proves himself innocent for the president of the United States? This is standing justice on its head.</p>, <p>In an interview with CBS News, Attorney General William Barr said he believes Mueller could have come to a conclusion as to whether the president obstructed justice. When he didn’t, Barr said he concluded he did not, based on the evidence.</p>, <p>That Mueller had nothing to say about what Trump dismisses as the ""phony"" Steele Dossier, which led to a FISA warrant allowing the FBI to spy (Barr’s word) on the Trump campaign, or the role of Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party in paying for the dossier, further corrupts the law and establishes a double standard as the only standard by which some politicians and members of the establishment live.</p>, <p>It should also be remembered that, though Mueller himself is a registered Republican, most of the <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/21/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-claims-about-Mueller/"">attorneys</a> on his team were registered Democrats. A handful donated money to Clinton’s 2016 campaign. Just how much confidence should be placed in a report put together by such people can be answered by asking about the confidence one might place in a report about a Democratic president and a team of Republican lawyers.</p>, <p>Thankfully, the Justice Department’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz, may offer more information as soon as this week, which could incriminate the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party for alleged corrupt activities in the last election. Additional information is likely to be forthcoming from U.S. Attorney John Durham, named by Barr to investigate the origins of surveillance of the Trump campaign.</p>, <p>This is likely what the left and the media fear most. While they are unable to counter the good economic news, their only hope to keep Trump from being re-elected is to remove him from office on charges of obstruction and corruption, or drive down his approval numbers in hopes of defeating him. Some polls show that strategy isn’t working.</p>, <p>In his farewell remarks, Mueller said his more than 400-page report is the last word. Some in Congress from both parties want him to testify. Mueller said he has nothing to add to the report, but there is more to say and Mueller should be required to say it.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>House Democrats may not want to have Mueller appear because Republicans will ask tough questions.

But on Wednesday, he ripped off the mask of neutrality and showed himself for what he is: A partisan in the fight between the populists and the establishment.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/h/steve-hilton"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON.</strong></a></p>, <p>We shouldn't be surprised -- Mueller<em> is</em> the establishment.

And James Comey was previously deputy attorney general. By an incredible coincidence, once Comey left that job to become the multi-million-dollar general counsel of defense giant Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin was awarded contract after contract, over a billion dollars' worth, by Robert Mueller's FBI.</p>, <p>And there's more, as we told you, last August:. I said the following:</p>, <p><em>""Robert Mueller's swampiness goes beyond awarding billion dollar contracts to his best friend's employer.. After leaving his post as FBI director, what did this modern-day saint, this paragon of ethics and integrity do? He cashed in, of course. Mueller went back to work for his old law and lobbying firm, now called Wilmer-Hale. And surprise surprise, his clients were directly related to his previous government work. One of them was Booz-Allen-Hamilton -- like Lockheed Martin, a giant surveillance contractor.

Always. And you take down any and every threat to your power. That's how to understand last week's extraordinary intervention by Mueller. It was the establishment's final stand against their mortal enemy - Trump, and the peasant's revolt he led in 2016.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice ...  President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>They tried to stop him getting elected by clearing Hillary Clinton. They tried to bring him down by manufacturing a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Russia collusion scandal</a>. And when all that failed, last week Robert Mueller played the obstruction card.</p>, <p>Strip away all the tortured legalese and intellectual incoherence, it all boiled down to one thing - Mueller saying, ""I can't prove he did it, but [wink] he did it."" He talked about ""another process,"" and with that weak, pathetic attempt to hide the explosive nature of what he was really saying, Mueller called on Congress to impeach the president.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Impeach him for what? He didn't plot with Putin to steal the election. Mueller found no evidence for that crazed establishment fantasy, despite two years of trying</p>, <p>The president didn't obstruct justice. Mueller found no evidence of that, either, as he himself admitted in a clarification put out later that same day. Mueller's claim that it was the regulation about not indicting a sitting president that stopped him recommending charges was a lie.</p>, <p>Let's be really clear about that: Robert Mueller -- yes, the straight-shooting man of integrity, Robert Mueller -- lied from the podium last Wednesday. He lied to cover up the fact that he didn't find evidence of obstruction to justify a criminal charge.</p>, <p>What did he he find? Stories about the president losing his temper. Of course he lost his temper! If a totally manufactured conspiracy theory about you being a traitor to your country and colluding with an enemy power derails your presidency for years, wouldn't you be annoyed about it? This was eruption, not obstruction.</p>, <p>What, we're going to impeach a president for venting, now? By that standard we should impeach Amy Klobuchar for that business with the salad and the comb. As the Wall Street Journal put it, Robert Mueller wants ""an impeachment inquiry to charge Donald Trump with obstructing an investigation that wasn't obstructed into a conspiracy that didn't exist.""</p>, <p>Mueller the straight shooter? With that bumbling, malicious press conference, he shot himself straight in the foot. His reputation is destroyed, and he has no-one to blame but himself.</p>, <p>Now it's time to fight back against the establishment. It's good that the origins of the plot against President Trump are now being investigated. But let's not leave it there.</p>, <p>What Mueller did at his press conference wasn't justice. It wasn't the rule of law. It was a smear -- false statement designed to cause material harm to President Trump, delivered with malice. You know what that is? The legal standard for defamation. President Trump should sue Robert Mueller for libel.</p>, <p>Next: Let's open a corruption investigation into the business dealings of Mueller and Comey in their swampy trips around the revolving door. Let's investigate those Lockheed Martin contracts. Let's investigate those client relationships at Mueller's swamp law firm where he had a conflict of interest.</p>, <p>Was there personal financial corruption? Let's investigate. After all, what's that phrase we've been hearing these last couple of years, ""we need to get to the bottom of it."" If Mueller and Comey have done nothing wrong, they've got nothing to fear from a corruption investigation. Right?</p>, <p>And let's take the fight to the ridiculous Never-Trumpers, too. Led by Bill Kristol, they're now joining the impeachment bandwagon with new ads under the banner of ""Republicans for the Rule of Law."" They say they're defending democracy.</p>, <p>Excuse me? They are literally attacking democracy, trying to overturn the democratic election of a president they despise. They talk about decency and honor and morality. What morality do they bring to the table, by the way?</p>, <p>Their demented ideology sent millons to their deaths in Middle East wars and cost our country trillions of dollars. Their dinner party decadence brought the authoritarian despots of China to the brink of world domination. And their craven genuflection to big business destroyed the American Dream for middle class families.</p>, <p>These Never -Trumpers, this corrupt establishment ... it is rotten. It has failed. But it's not dead yet.</p>, <p>They think they can kick out Trump and take back power. Do not let them. It's time to fight them.

Partly by tackling full-force the algae blooms that garnered nationwide attention when they threatened Florida’s waters and economy. DeSantis created a top-drawer task force of environmental academics to study the toxic blue-green slime, put more effort behind monitoring the state’s water management procedures, vowed to oppose offshore drilling, allocated funds for cleaning up existing blooms, and promised a host of other measures including creating a 17,000 acre Everglades reservoir.</p>, <p>The aggressive commitment is working for him, and for the people of Florida. There’s a lesson there.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>Millennial voters want action on climate change. They won’t be impressed by rational debates on the topic, or cost-benefit analyses. They don’t care that China spews more pollution into the air than the U.S. and Europe combined, or that Beijing is still building coal-powered plants despite its empty promises to clean up its act. They are unimpressed that the U.S. is one of the few developed nations that has lowered emissions, because of the increased use of natural gas.</p>, <p>None of those facts damp the fervor of young voters. The GOP has to have an answer, or several answers, that focus the debate away from futuristic projections of sea changes or rising temperatures and instead on achievable, pragmatic solutions to existing environmental challenges that do not undermine our energy industries (which give U.S. producers an important competitive advantage) or our way of life.</p>, <p>For example: Republicans should attack the dumping of plastic into the oceans. Or, promise to follow through on the government’s long-stalled plan to dispose of <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">nuclear waste</a>. Or campaign on making sure every American has access to safe drinking water. Each region has individual issues, but some appeal nationally.</p>, <p>Like, for instance, cleaning up the oceans. The rising amounts of everlasting garbage in our waterways is a horror. Finding plastic in the bellies of fish and in pristine seas is disgusting; we can all get on board with trying to fix that.</p>, <p>As Americans head to the beach this summer, they will find evidence of this blight; plastic floating in the sea off Cape Cod, fish that have swallowed parts of straws or other bits of garbage in the Great Lakes, water bottles washed up on Santa Monica Beach. This is a nationwide, indeed, a global problem.</p>, <p>The Ocean Conservancy reports that “every year, 8 million metric tons of plastics enter our ocean on top of the estimated 150 million metric tons that currently circulate our marine environments.” The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) equates 8 million metric tons to the weight of 90 aircraft carriers.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation.</p>, <p>Plastic does not decompose; it just piles up. It does, however, break down into tiny bits called microplastics, generally smaller than 5 mm, which can end up in fish or other seas creatures we eat. The Conservancy says that 60 percent of seabirds and 100 percent of sea turtle varieties have plastic in their systems, having mistaken straws and other items for food.</p>, <p>While some plastic sinks to the ocean floor, some floats and can gather into large areas of debris. The largest “dump” of plastic garbage is found between Hawaii and California, in the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). The “patch” is estimated to cover a surface area of 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly three times the size of France. A group called Ocean Cleanup <a href=""https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/"">calculates</a> there are more than 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic in the dump, weighing an estimated 80,000 metric tons. </p>, <p>Attacking this pollution of our waterways is important, and would be popular.</p>, <p>Similarly, candidates should campaign on safely burying our nation’s nuclear waste in the Yucca Mountain site selected by Congress in 1987 but stalled for political reasons by the Obama administration in 2015. As Wyoming Republican Senator John Barrasso <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/get-serious-about-burying-nuclear-waste-11559084981"">wrote</a> recently in the Wall Street Journal, the Yucca site sits on 8,400 square miles of U.S.-owned land, an area bigger than the state of Massachusetts. It has been determined that our nuclear leftovers could be safely buried there for at least one million years. </p>, <p>Moving forward on secure disposal might smooth the path for nuclear energy, which today supplies, as Barrasso points out, 60 percent of our carbon-free energy, or “more than three times the energy produced by wind and more than 18 times the amount from solar.” We cannot be serious about addressing climate change unless we welcome increased nuclear power.</p>, <p>After the people of Flint, Michigan, were delivered water containing dangerous amounts of lead, the nation learned that not every citizen has access to clean and safe drinking water. This is an outrage in our prosperous nation, and an important challenge, which Republicans would do well to embrace.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Climate and environment are not the same.
