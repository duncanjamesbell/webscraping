Number theorists recently published technical criterion that shows a significant portion of the hypothesis. Teams behind an eventual solution to the hypothesis are entitled to a $1-million prize.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Did a team of mathematicians just take a big step toward answering a 160-year-old, million-dollar question in mathematics?</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Maybe. The crew did solve a number of other, smaller questions in a field called number theory. And in doing so, they have reopened an old avenue that might eventually lead to an answer to the old question: Is the Riemann hypothesis correct?</p>, <p>The Reimann hypothesis is a fundamental mathematical conjecture that has huge implications for the rest of math. It forms the foundation for many other mathematical ideas — but no one knows if it's true. Its validity has become one of the most famous open questions in mathematics. It's one of seven ""Millennium Problems"" laid out in 2000, with the promise that whoever solves them will win $1 million. (Only one of the problems has since been solved.) [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/26584-5-mind-boggling-math-facts.html"">5 Seriously Mind-Boggling Math Facts</a>]</p>, <p>Back in 1859, a German mathematician named Bernhard Riemann proposed an answer to a particularly thorny math equation. His hypothesis goes like this: The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2. That's a pretty abstract mathematical statement, having to do with what numbers you can put into a particular mathematical function to make that function equal zero. But it turns out to matter a great deal, most importantly regarding questions of how often you'll encounter prime numbers as you count up toward infinity.</p>, <p>We'll come back to the details of the hypothesis later. But the important thing to know now is that if the Riemann hypothesis is true, it answers a lot of questions in mathematics.</p>, <p>""So often in number theory, what ends up happening is if you assume the Riemann hypothesis [is true], you're then able to prove all kinds of other results,"" Lola Thompson, a number theorist at Oberlin College in Ohio, who wasn't involved in this latest research, said.</p>, <p>Often, she told Live Science, number theorists will first prove that something is true if the Riemann hypothesis is true. Then they'll use that proof as a sort of stepping stone toward a more intricate proof, which shows that their original conclusion is true whether or not the Riemann hypothesis is true.</p>, <p>The fact that this trick works, she said, convinces many mathematicians that the Riemann hypothesis must be true.</p>, <p>But the truth is that nobody knows for sure.</p>, <p>So how did this small team of mathematicians seem to bring us closer toward a solution?</p>, <p>""What we have done in our paper,"" said Ken Ono, a number theorist at Emory University and co-author of the new proof, ""is we revisited a very technical criterion which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis … and we proved a large part of it. We proved a large chunk of this criterion.""</p>, <p>A ""criterion which is equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis,"" in this case, refers to a separate statement that is mathematically equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis.</p>, <p>It's not obvious at first glance why the two statements are so connected. (The criterion has to do with something called the ""hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials."") But in the 1920s, a Hungarian mathematician named George Pólya proved that if this criterion is true, then the Riemann hypothesis is true — and vice versa. It's an old proposed route toward proving the hypothesis, but one that had been largely abandoned.</p>, <p>Ono and his colleagues, in a paper published May 21 in the journal <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/20/1902572116"">Proceedings of the Natural Academy of Sciences</a> (PNAS), proved that in many, many cases, the criterion is true.</p>, <p>But in math, many is not enough to count as a proof. There are still some cases where they don't know if the criterion is true or false.</p>, <p>""It's like playing a million-number Powerball,"" Ono said. ""And you know all the numbers but the last 20. If even one of those last 20 numbers is wrong, you lose. … It could still all fall apart.""</p>, <p>Researchers would need to come up with an even more advanced proof to show the criterion is true in all cases, thereby proving the Riemann hypothesis. And it's not clear how far away such a proof is, Ono said.</p>, <p>In terms of the Riemann hypothesis, it's tough to say how big a deal this is. A lot depends on what happens next.</p>, <p>""This [criterion] is just one of many equivalent formulations of the Riemann hypothesis,"" Thompson said.</p>, <p>In other words, there are a lot of other ideas that, like this criterion, would prove that the Riemann hypothesis is true if they themselves were proven.</p>, <p>""So, it's really hard to know how much progress this is, because on the one hand it's made progress in this direction. But, there's so many equivalent formulations that maybe this direction isn't going to yield the Riemann hypothesis. Maybe one of the other equivalent theorems instead will, if someone can prove one of those,"" Thompson said.</p>, <p>If the proof turns up along this track, then that will likely mean Ono and his colleagues have developed an important underlying framework for solving the Riemann hypothesis. But if it turns up somewhere else, then this paper will turn out to have been less important.</p>, <p>Still, mathematicians are impressed.</p>, <p>""Although this remains far away from proving the Riemann hypothesis, it is a big step forward,"" Encrico Bombieri, a Princeton number theorist who was not involved in the team's research, wrote in an accompanying May 23 <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/05/22/1906804116"">PNAS</a> article. ""There is no doubt that this paper will inspire further fundamental work in other areas of number theory as well as in mathematical physics.""</p>, <p>(Bombieri won a Fields Medal — the most prestigious prize in mathematics — in 1974, in large part for work related to the Riemann hypothesis.)</p>, <p>I promised we'd get back to this. Here's the Riemann hypothesis again: The real part of every non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2.</p>, <p>Let's break that down according to how Thompson and Ono explained it.</p>, <p>First, what's the Riemann zeta function?</p>, <p>In math, a function is a relationship between different mathematical quantities. A simple one might look like this: y = 2x.</p>, <p>The Riemann zeta function follows the same basic principles. Only it's much more complicated. Here's what it looks like.</p>, <p>It's a sum of an infinite sequence, where each term — the first few are 1/1^s, 1/2^s and 1/3^s — is added to the previous terms. Those ellipses mean the series in the function keeps going on like that, forever.</p>, <p>Now we can answer the second question: What is a zero of the Riemann zeta function?</p>, <p>This is easier. A ""zero"" of the function is any number you can put in for x that causes the function to equal zero.</p>, <p>Next question: What's the ""real part"" of one of those zeros, and what does it mean that it equals 1/2?</p>, <p>The Riemann zeta function involves what mathematicians call ""complex numbers."" A complex number looks like this: a+b*i.</p>, <p>In that equation, ""a"" and ""b"" stand for any real numbers. A real number can be anything from minus 3, to zero, to 4.9234, pi, or 1 billion. But there's another kind of number: imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers emerge when you take the square root of a negative number, and they're important, showing up in all kinds of mathematical contexts. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/58249-surprising-facts-about-pi.html"">10 Surprising Facts About Pi</a>]</p>, <p>The simplest imaginary number is the square root of -1, which is written as ""i."" A complex number is a real number (""a"") plus another real number (""b"") times i. The ""real part"" of a complex number is that ""a.""</p>, <p>A few zeros of the Riemann zeta function, negative integers between -10 and 0, don't count for the Reimann hypothesis. These are considered ""trivial"" zeros because they’re real numbers, not complex numbers. All the other zeros are ""non-trivial"" and complex numbers.</p>, <p>The Riemann hypothesis states that when the Riemann zeta function crosses zero (except for those zeros between -10 and 0), the real part of the complex number has to equal to 1/2.</p>, <p>That little claim might not sound very important. But it is. And we may be just a teensy bit closer to solving it.</p>, <p><em>Originally published on <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/"">Live Science</a>.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Volunteers are at the frontline managing Philadelphia’s exploding cat crisis</p>, <p class=""speakable"">PHILADELPHIA -- Every summer, Julie Crowe's back patio becomes overrun with stray cats. They climb on her barbecue grill, feast on her garden and leave a putrid stench that forces her to keep the windows of her home shut.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">No amount of eggshells, chili peppers or bleach keeps the felines out of her trash bins. Just last week, she discovered a litter of six kittens and a momma cat living off of leftovers.</p>, <p>“I got an estimate to try to enclose the patio, and it's $3,000,” said Crowe, “I don’t have it and shouldn’t have to pay it to enjoy my own backyard.”</p>, <p>Philadelphia’s feral cat population has long been an issue. But in recent years, the number of stray cats roaming the streets has exploded, with hundreds of colonies clustered in vacant lots, abandoned buildings or neighborhood yards.</p>, <p>Philadelphia is now home to nearly half a million stray or <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature"" target=""_blank"">feral cats</a>. And residents say they have had it.</p>, <p>""An unmanageable situation,"" said Alley Cagnazzi, coordinator of the city's Animal Care and Control Team, or ACCT, who said her department alone cannot handle the uptick of feral cats.</p>, <p>
      Feral cats recently trapped in South Philadelphia awaiting transportation to ACCT to be neutered.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Talia Kirkland / (Fox News))</span></p>, <p>As cities across the country began a kinder, gentler approach to the feral cat problem -- the felines years ago were immediately euthanized but many places now spay them – some places began seeing a growing litter of stray cats. Shelters in Philadelphia are crammed with feral cats and, because adoption is not an option, the untamed animals mostly roamed free.</p>, <p>""Every single shelter in the city would be overflowing, there is literally not enough space,"" said Cagnazzi.</p>, <p>But now cities like Philly have turned to neighborhood “volunteers” to serve on the front lines of the war to control the feral cat problem.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/pennsylvania-man-baited-cats-fishhooks"" target=""_blank"">PENNSYLVANIA MAN ALLEGEDLY USED FISHHOOKS, POLE IN GRUESOME 'FISHING FOR CATS' PLAN</a></strong></p>, <p>Honorary soldier Jean Van Sciver, or neighborhood ""cat-mom,"" responded quickly to the city's call for help. Van Sciver, who unexpectedly died after her interview with Fox News, said she had taken care of a few hundred cats over the last few years.</p>, <p>Every evening after work, she would set out paper plates loaded with wet and dry kibble, and watch from her window as the cats tip-toed into her yard to eat. She pointed out each of “her” cats have a clipped left ear indicating it had been spayed or neutered. Van Sciver had trapped them herself and, once fixed, she treated them as quasi-pets.</p>, <p>
      Jean Van Sciver, a colony ""caretaker"" feeds her feral cats through her window.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Talia Kirkland / (Fox News))</span></p>, <p>""I'm not going to see them starve,"" she said, “They live here, they are just [my] outside cats.”</p>, <p>Colony caretakers, like Van Sciver, are community volunteers who help trap strays and get them fixed. In Philadelphia, this is a free service provided by ACCT, which will then return the cats to their neighborhoods or colony caretakers in a process known as ""trap, neuter, release,"" or TNR.</p>, <p>Though the program’s impact isn’t crystal clear, some believe it can make a difference.</p>, <p>“There are a lot of misconceptions surrounding TNR and, in order for community volunteers to be successful, education and support are key,” said Karen O'Rourke, president of Stray Cat Relief Fund, or SCRF, a volunteer-run, non-profit providing shelter, and medication to the felines.</p>, <p>According to the Humane Society, for decades feral cats were not much of a municipality concern. Animal control officers would round up strays only after a complaint, a practice that typically ended in euthanasia. The problem with that system, O’Rourke said, is that too many colonies were going uncontrolled, and cats that were taken off the street were swiftly replaced. Females can have litters every 63 days.</p>, <p>Nationally, the TNR program has been adopted by more than a dozen states, including California, where recent wildfires exposed hundreds of strays, and in cities like Chicago, where it is credited with reducing the feral cat population.</p>, <p>The most famous test case for TNR came in Newburyport, Mass., a tourist town where hundreds of stray cats hung out along the waterfront, dining on Dumpster scraps. Volunteers set out humane traps, and eventually managed to get every cat sterilized.</p>, <p>The population steadily dropped, and in 2009, reportedly the last feral waterfront cat died at the age of 16. Cats only live about five years after being spayed.</p>, <p>However, some have objected to program, saying outdoor cats are a menace to birds and other wildlife. They claim the effort to be more compassionate to wild cats has come at a steep price.</p>, <p>A 2012 study co-authored by Peter Marra, the chief of the Smithsonian’s migratory bird center, found that an estimated 2.4 billion birds and 12.3 billion small mammals in the U.S. are killed annually by free-roaming cats.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/science/australia-feral-cats-poisoned-sausages"" target=""_blank"">AUSTRALIAN OFFICIALS KILLING MILLIONS OF FERAL CATS WITH POISONED SAUSAGES</a></strong></p>, <p>
      Pretty deadly: Feral cats have contributed to the extinction of dozens of Australian mammal species.
      <span class=""copyright"">(Threatened Species Recovery Hub of the Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme)</span></p>, <p>In Philadephia, the city’s parks department has not taken an official stance. In a recent interview with Philadelphia’s WHYY, city officials said their main objective is not the welfare of feral cats, but to maintain safe and accessible park spaces for city residents.</p>, <p>The city posted an article on its website written by environmental planner Tony Croasdale that said the kitties are not as innocent as they look.</p>, <p>“These outside cats will kill hundreds to thousands of wild prey in their lifetime,” the article said. ""While it is understandable that some people have a strong emotional attachment towards outside cats since cats are such a popular pet, many other people feel similarly towards wildlife.”</p>, <p>More than 60,000 feral cats were sterilized through the Philadelphia's TNR program in 2017.  Though the city is still overrun by cats, some say the practice appears to be working.</p>, <p>""Boots on the ground,"" said Kelsey Lauder, a volunteer with the Stray Cat Relief Fund. ""It's going to take neighbors in their back alleys working together before we see any significant change.""</p>, <p>Lauder said her organization is getting the friendly kittens off the street and putting them into homes, and the neutering and spaying efforts are reducing the population.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>O’Rourke said sterilizing even a single feral cat can make a huge difference in controlling the overall population, and can even improve a cat's behavior.</p>, <p>“Fixed and vaccinated cats are healthier,” said O’Rourke. “They are also less aggressive so no more fighting, howling and spraying. And ultimately one more fixed cat means one less litter of kittens.”</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

The sprawling report is 448 pages long, however. In his nine-minute address, Mueller quite consciously highlighted the portions of the report that fuel the Democrats’ calls for impeachment.</p>, <p>Mueller was adamant that he did not make a finding on whether President Trump should be charged with obstruction of justice because the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued guidance forbidding the indictment of a sitting president. I've argued before that he is completely wrong on this, but that is beside the point.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>What matters is that Mueller can be fairly understood to be saying he believed President Trump committed obstruction of justice. That is not the only possible interpretation, but it is the most likely interpretation.</p>, <p>Mueller said Wednesday that if he had concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge Trump with obstruction, he would have said so (as he did with collusion). He then emphasized that he did not say so. That strongly implies that he believes the evidence is sufficient (notwithstanding that the attorney general has found otherwise). Mueller added that, in deciding not to allege obstruction even though the evidence was arguably sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he relied on the OLC guidance. Finally, he deduced from this, and from his understanding of the Constitution, that in our system it is for Congress, not federal prosecutors, to deal with presidential misconduct.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-press-conference-impeachment-politics-democrats/""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</strong></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/andrew-mccarthy""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

There’s no doubt about it.</p>, <p>Last week, to remedy some of that struggle, President Trump announced a $16-billion-dollar aid package for those farmers impacted by this trade scuffle with China.</p>, <p>“We are gonna do a subsidy program….everybody is asking for money…just give us a flat table…nobody can compete with us…we are giving them a level playing field…giving them that level playing field that’s so important,"" said Trump.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout but they would like a level playing field and you can make that happen... easily. </p>, <p>It’s true, our farmers and ranchers don’t want a hand out at all.</p>, <p>They want a level playing field. Few D.C. politicians understand that because they are used to patronizing Americans with lip service and a check.</p>, <p>Now let me be clear, I understand why President Trump issued this aid, the second round since July of last year when the government allocated $12 billion to offset the plight.</p>, <p>Do I think a multi-billion dollar farm subsidy or bailout will fix the problem? No.</p>, <p>But President Trump had to do something to shut up the beltway Democrats and media hacks who launched an anti-Trump smear campaign blaming him for farmer’s woes.</p>, <p>Yes, the trade negotiations with China have certainly been a factor BUT consider this: corn, soybean and wheat prices began their decline in mid-2012, long before Trump took office and imposed tariffs.</p>, <p>Why? Well, there's no single answer for that but overproduction had a lot to do with it.</p>, <p>Our farmers have been planting and preparing enough crops to feed the world and yes, trade uncertainty threw a wrench in the process.</p>, <p>But here’s something else to consider -- although our imports on grain, corn, and soybeans are indeed very low, why are we importing AT ALL?</p>, <p>If we produce enough of those crops to feed the world AND have an overproduction surplus, why import at all, even a tiny amount?</p>, <p>Guess what else we import a lot of in recent years -- beef products.</p>, <p>Follow the money. American cattle ranches rely on American farmers for feed. The American cattleman has been royally screwed over by foreign beef imports with many ranchers run completely out of business.</p>, <p>In fact, according to data compiled by American Cattlemen advocacy group RCALF, we have eliminated over 175,000 cattle farms and ranches since 1994, the year we entered NAFTA.</p>, <p>Consequently, we have 8.5 million fewer cattle today than we had in 1994. Those missing cows would be eating a lot of corn.</p>, <p>Also, if we were raising and feeding the half-a-million cattle that we import each year for immediate slaughter, there would be additional demand for crops that could have fed those animals, right here in the U.S.</p>, <p>Fewer American cattle ranchers leads to less demand for American feed and hence, we now have an over-abundance of corn, grain, and wheat.</p>, <p>A surplus drives down prices and hits our American farmers in the pocketbook. It is all linked.</p>, <p>The USDA is planning a $100 million trade promotion program for livestock producers, yet, if you look at this latest $16-billion-dollar farm bailout, there are allowances for crops, dairy and hogs but NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH for American cattle ranchers.</p>, <p>President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout either but they would like that level playing field and you can make that happen, easily.</p>, <p>Under regulations Trump inherited from the Obama administration, the beef you find in a local grocery store can be labeled ‘Product of USA’ as long as it was packaged here. So it could have been born and raised virtually anywhere. </p>, <p>There is hope, with a stroke of a pen, President Trump could reinstate country of origin labeling on beef products so consumers know where their meat is from.</p>, <p>This simple action would be worth more than a billion-dollar handout or subsidy from Uncle Sam.</p>, <p>This farm aid might be a short-term bandaid for American farmers but what about our American ranchers?</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>President Trump, “Made in the USA” used to mean something and you have the power to bring it back.

Yet, Pelosi is the most uncomfortable. She is caught between progressives who want the president impeached yesterday and moderates who don’t want any discussion of impeachment at all.</p>, <p>The statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Wednesday certainly won’t help matters. In fact, his unwillingness to testify on Capitol Hill is only going to further enrage progressives who believe that the Trump administration is stonewalling their investigation.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mary-anne-marsh-trump-the-extremely-stable-genius-who-cant-resist-taking-pelosis-bait"" target=""_blank"">MARY ANNE MARSH: TRUMP IS THE ‘EXTREMELY STABLE GENIUS’ WHO CAN’T RESIST TAKING PELOSI’S BAIT</a></strong></p>, <p>Now, the Speaker and her leadership team are trying to prevent an ugly civil war in the caucus.</p>, <p>It is obvious that Speaker Pelosi wants to destroy the President, without having to actually impeach him. Formally impeaching Trump would endanger the Democratic moderates she needs to retain control of the House. Worse, in the Senate, the President will win an overwhelming vote to reject the articles of impeachment.</p>, <p>If the House impeaches the president, progressives will celebrate a symbolic victory but it will be pyrrhic – at least politically. Republicans will be energized by beating back an attempt by Democrats to remove their commander in chief.</p>, <p>Looking to the 2020 election, a failed impeachment could ensure another term for Donald Trump, a missed attempt by Democrats to take the Senate, and a threat to the Democratic control of the House. The president is aware of this situation, which is why his administration refuses to comply with subpoenas from House Committees controlled by Democrats. He is daring them to impeach him.</p>, <p>Yet, no matter how many times Pelosi explains this scenario to progressives in her caucus, it will fall on deaf ears. This is because the progressive Democrats are worried that if they fail to secure an impeachment vote, it will cost them politically. After all, back home, their voters demand impeachment.</p>, <p>Without an impeachment vote, progressives worry they could get a primary challenger; a candidate who could promise to impeach the president when elected to Congress.</p>, <p>This dynamic where Pelosi opposes impeachment to help Democratic moderates stay in office, but puts progressives at risk of losing their primary election, is an untenable long-term position.</p>, <p>Pelosi needs a way to pacify the progressives demanding the president be removed from office, while not going down the impeachment road. Here is a way she can do both:</p>, <p>If progressives on Capitol Hill can convince 15 Republican Senators to agree to vote for impeachment, Pelosi should agree to bring up articles of impeachment, and that she will work with progressives to try and get the five more Republican Senators constitutionally-required to remove the president from the White House. </p>, <p>The campaign to convince those Republican Senators can be partially waged through investigations, and going to court to force the Trump administration to comply with subpoenas.</p>, <p>By offering this compromise, the Speaker is not refusing the impeach the president. But rather, making a promise to impeach Donald Trump only if there is a real chance that he will be removed from office.</p>, <p>Keep in mind, as of today, not a single Republican Senator would vote in favor of ending Donald Trump’s presidency. The only Republican who believes the president’s actions investigated by Robert Mueller are impeachable is Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan. But he serves in the House and has no vote in the Senate, where the president’s fate will ultimately be decided.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>When Congressman Amash made his pronouncement, not a single other Republican – even those who viscerally dislike the president – followed. No surprise, the president enjoys a 90 percent approval rate from Republicans.</p>, <p>Speaker Pelosi, by agreeing to impeach the president only if there is a realistic chance the Senate will convict him, will not pacify all of the progressives in Congress or their voters back home. But, it can slow the impeachment talk. It also gives progressives on Capitol Hill some political cover by forcing progressive voters to acknowledge reality: they cannot remove the president from office unless they can first convince a lot of Republican Senators to do the same.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/gary-meltz"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GARY MELTZ</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable""><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"" target=""_blank"">Special counsel Robert Mueller</a> spoke Wednesday, breaking his silence on the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation"" target=""_blank"">Russia probe</a> and his report about the investigation of Russian interference in America’s elections.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The special counsel not only announced that he will retire from the Department of Justice but he will no longer be speaking on the matter. Mueller’s words and tone were quite different than that of the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/william-barr"" target=""_blank"">Attorney General, William Barr</a>. Mueller clearly struck a sharper edge with his words than many of us read in his 448-page long report. As former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said: Mueller’s statement “definitely contradicts what the attorney general said when he summarized Mueller’s report""</p>, <p>As both sides, left and right, Democrat and Republican waited with bated breath for the special counsel's statement; with these few sentences, he handed the Democrats a gift and gave them the green light to stay the course with investigations, and perhaps, even impeachment.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-rally-behind-mueller-statement-poised-to-impeach"" target=""_blank"">DEMS RAMP UP CALLS FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT AFTER MUELLER SPEAKS OUT ON RUSSIA PROBE</a></strong></p>, <p>Mueller stated: “If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.” Even though this sentence is in his written report, the fact that the special counsel chose to emphasize that point is quite telling. It’s not only what he said, but what he did not say; nothing about the president being exonerated, no utterance of ‘no collusion, no obstruction.’</p>, <p>Mueller went on to explain that charging the president with a crime was not an option for the special counsel’s office, but the opinion that a sitting president cannot be indicted is ‘unconstitutional.’ In this statement, and reference that there are other authorities with power over the president, Mueller was in my opinion, very clear; only Congress has the power to punish a sitting president. And with that, it’s game on for Congress.</p>, <p>But perhaps the most important words from the special counsel were his last: “I will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments – that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election and that allegation deserves the attention of every American. “</p>, <p>So in stating that the report does not say the president did not commit a crime and that this deserves the attention of an investigation and adds further that there were multiple systematic attempts to interfere in the investigation; this is code speak for: Congress do your job!</p>, <p>And Congress was listening.</p>, <p>Shortly after Mueller’s statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler tweeted:</p>, <p>“Given that Special Counsel Mueller was unable to pursue criminal charges against the President, it falls to Congress to respond to the crimes, lies and other wrongdoing of President Trump…and we will do so. No one, not even the President of the United States, is above the law.”</p>, <p>And with these words from the special counsel, ""The Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse the president of wrongdoing,"" it not only signaled game on for Congress to investigate further; but for some, this was Mueller essentially referring Congress to impeach the president.</p>, <p>Shortly after Mueller spoke, some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates weighed in:</p>, <p>Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said: ""I think it’s a fair inference from what we heard in that press conference that Bob Mueller was essentially referring impeachment to the United States Congress.”</p>, <p>Pete Buttigieg said: “This is as close to an impeachment referral as you could get under the circumstances.”</p>, <p>And Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said Robert Mueller’s statement makes it clear: ""Congress has a legal and moral obligation to begin impeachment proceedings immediately.""</p>, <p>Congress has the Constitutional responsibility of oversight of the executive branch. It’s not only within their realm of power to conduct further investigations but it is their duty to the American people. But do the American people want further investigations? Or impeachment?</p>, <p>Earlier Wednesday on Fox News Channel, Andrew McCarthy, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York said:</p>, <p>""I think it changes things in the sense that the Democrats who wanted impeachment are going to be more aggressive, more forward on that. Now, where it goes, because impeachment is political and not legal, really depends on what the polls say. And I think if the polls say the public has had it with this and wants to move on, then there’ll be a lot of blather about impeachment, but it probably won’t go further than that. If it gets some traction, we’re going to see more proceedings and more hearings.""</p>, <p>But I’m not so sure McCarthy is right.</p>, <p>Polls show that the majority of Americans are against impeaching the president. But a majority of Democrats who voted for those in Congress and made the Democrats a majority in the House do want impeachment.</p>, <p>The problem is, as I have stated in other Fox News op-eds, that impeachment will not remove the president from office, especially with a Republican-controlled Senate. And at last count, there were between 34 and 40 Democrats who are pushing for impeachment, certainly not the majority, and only one Republican.</p>, <p>I say again, impeaching the president could backfire for Democrats politically as it did for Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton. So impeaching President Trump would be more symbolic and could turn those voters on the fence off, or those voters expecting Democrats to write legislation regarding health care, immigration, climate change, etc., leading them to stay home -- or worse for Democrats -- voting for Trump and giving him a second term.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>With Mueller’s words Wednesday, much like in his written report, he passed the buck. With his written report he passed the decision of charging the president to the attorney general’s office. With his words, he passed the task of investigating these matters further with Congress. It’s as if he said, I’ve done my job, now you run with it.</p>, <p>Now we will see if Congress runs with the will of the majority of Americans, or with the will of a segment of the Democratic Party.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/leslie-marshall"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

All rights reserved. All market data delayed 20 minutes.</p>, <p data-v-275a95fe="""">Teachers told to favor black students in 'racial equity' training; reaction from National Review contributing editor Deroy Murdock.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Democrat and <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-de-blasio-inept-presidential-bid-judge-nap"" target=""_blank"">New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio</a> and Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza are operating a truly Orwellian scheme wherein the search for “racial equity” requires teachers, principals, and superintendents to treat black students unequally from whites. Specifically, blacks are presumed to be downtrodden victims, while whites constitute a privileged, comfortable elite – never mind any black or white person’s actual circumstances.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Courageous Conversations is a mandatory program to expunge the “implicit bias” of every Department of Education employee. It does not regard people as individuals within <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york"" target=""_blank"">New York City’s government school system</a>. Rather everyone is evaluated as a member of one racial group or another. And on that basis alone, all sorts of conclusions instantly emerge: White skin means a life filled with jackpots. Black skin signifies an existence rife with snake eyes.</p>, <p>This dermis <em>über alles</em> approach is the dictionary definition of racism.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/de-blasio-on-trump-i-get-under-his-skin-probes-will-lead-to-impeachment"" target=""_blank""><strong>DE BLASIO ON TRUMP: I 'GET UNDER HIS SKIN,' PROBES WILL 'LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT'</strong></a></p>, <p>City Hall and the Department of Education are spending $23 million in taxpayer funds to force school employees to fetishize their racial differences and their supposed inner bigotry. New teachers in New York average $56,711 annually. So, this haul could finance 405 new teachers. Instead, it pays to pick at racial scabs until they bleed.</p>, <p>While this blood is metaphorical, the pain is not.</p>, <p>As Saturday’s New York Post reported, a group of school superintendents met in spring 2018 for a racial-training session. They discussed the question, “What lived experience inspires you as a leader to fight for equity?”</p>, <p>A Jewish superintendent noted that her grandmother hid in a Polish forest while fleeing the Nazis. Her grandfather, she recalled, spent six years in a labor and concentration camp and watched helplessly as his mother and sister were executed.</p>, <p>“My grandparents taught me to understand the dangers of ‘targeted racism’ or the exclusion of any group, and the importance of equity for all people,” the Jewish employee told her associates. “This is my core value as an educator.”</p>, <p>As she told the Post: “At the break, I stood up and, to my surprise, I was verbally attacked by a black superintendent in front of my colleagues. She said ‘This is not about being Jewish! It’s about black and brown boys of color only. You better check yourself.’”</p>, <p>“I was traumatized,” said the Jewish educator. “It was like 1939 all over again.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">This stipulation of black failure is a recipe for black failure. If black kids hear from their teachers, principals, and school officials that white racism is as ubiquitous as atmospheric nitrogen, then why bother trying to prosper? Far more sensible – this grim, race-crazed illogic goes – to surrender and accept a life of government dependency, indolence, and worse.</p>, <p>Carranza has railed against “white-supremacy culture.” According to Department of Education training materials, this outlook includes such allegedly Anglocentric concepts as “objectivity,” “individualism,” and “worship of the written word.”</p>, <p>If this “disrupt and dismantle” initiative (as its supporters call it) were implemented in Birmingham, Alabama in 1965 or 1970, one might see the need to help people exorcise their inner racial demons within spitting distance of segregation.</p>, <p>But LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – nearly 55 years ago. And the men and women being marched through the de Blasio-Carranza racial re-education camp work 961 miles north of Birmingham – for the New York City school system! Overwhelmingly, these are liberal Democrats who did the wave when Obama won and wept in the fetal position when Hillary lost.</p>, <p>These teachers-union and principals-union members already are among America’s most racially correct individuals. So, de Blasio and Carranza are spending tens of millions of tax dollars to help them excise their inner Jim Crows?</p>, <p>The mayor and chancellor may have to shell out $90 million, now that three white women filed suit yesterday, claiming that they were demoted in favor of less-qualified minority personnel. “If you draw a paycheck from DOE,” the suit says Carranza hectored employees last June, “get on board with my equity platform or leave.”</p>, <p>As part of what this litigation calls Carranza’s “totalitarian threat,” Dermisa Amante, CEO of Disruptive Equity Education Project, reportedly scored $175,000 to keep Gotham’s educators thinking about race – non-stop.</p>, <p>“You are going to have to talk about your power and your privilege,” she told Department of Education brass in February, according to the Post. “This might feel dangerous because you are going to have to talk about race daily.”</p>, <p>Amante also explained that “racial equity” requires racial inequity. She told school administrators:</p>, <p>“If I had a poor white male student, and I had a middle-class black boy, I would actually put my equitable strategies and interventions into that middle-class black boy because, over the course of his lifetime, he will have less access and less [sic] opportunities than that poor white boy.”</p>, <p>Really?</p>, <p>If this race-driven dearth of black-male life prospects is so axiomatic, how did neurosurgeon and HUD Secretary Ben Carson, M.D. make it?</p>, <p>How did former American Express CEO Ken Chenault make it?</p>, <p>How did astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson make it?</p>, <p>How did Motown founder Barry Gordy make it?</p>, <p>How did Academy Award-winning cineaste Spike Lee make it?</p>, <p>How did CNN anchor Don Lemon make it?</p>, <p>How did Fox Business Network host Charles Payne make it?</p>, <p>How did Tony Award-winning actor Denzel Washington make it?</p>, <p>How did author and Fox News contributor Juan Williams make it?</p>, <p>Conversely, how have so many anonymous white men on opioids <em>not</em> made it?</p>, <p>One of Carranza’s indoctrination sessions unveiled a “racial advantage hierarchy” with whites at the top, blacks at the bottom, and Americans of Asian descent not even mentioned. Why? According to attendee Ingrid Flinn, they supposedly enjoy “proximity to white privilege” and “benefit from white supremacy.”</p>, <p>This stipulation of black failure is a recipe for black failure. If black kids hear from their teachers, principals, and school officials that white racism is as ubiquitous as atmospheric nitrogen, then why bother trying to prosper? Far more sensible – this grim, race-crazed illogic goes – to surrender and accept a life of government dependency, indolence, and worse.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>New York’s schools should ignore this self-destructive rubbish and, instead, study black success and learn to duplicate it. Step one is to achieve educational excellence.</p>, <p>Finally, rather than breed suspicion by assuming implicit bias, why not assume implicit <em>decency</em>? If someone says or does something racist, help him see the light. If he persists, shun him. But otherwise, encourage people to get along and learn to love others like and unlike them via respect, friendship, and affection – not rage, fear, and animus.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/deroy-murdock"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DEROY MURDOCK</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Mueller explained that he will not testify before Congress. Why? Because he's got nothing more to say. It's all in that 448-page report, which you can read online if you feel like it.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">So why bother giving this speech in the first place? Well, Robert Mueller had a message he wanted to deliver. Not a message for you or me or the rest of the audience at home, but a message aimed at a very small group of elected officials in Washington.</p>, <p>Years of investigations could not produce a criminal charge against Donald Trump, but Mueller suggested Congress could still step in, saying, ""The opinion says that the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/c/tucker-carlson"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.</strong></a></p>, <p>""A process other than the criminal justice system.""

Now it is up to Congress to hold this President accountable. We need to start impeachment proceedings. It's our constitutional obligation.""</p>, <p>Beto O'Rourke, meanwhile, took a break from skateboarding to agree. ""There must be consequences,"" he wrote. ""Accountability and justice. The only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>And then from their seats on cable news sets across New York City, America's opinion generating class applauded heartily:</p>, <p><em>Ari Melber, MSNBC host: This was vintage Bob Mueller, no questions, no bull.</em></p>, <p><em>Frank Figliuzzi, MSNBC national security analyst: He speaks in measured, but clear tones and style. </em></p>, <p><em>Glenn Kirschner, former federal prosecutor: That's the man Bob Mueller is. He is precise. He is factual. He is accurate. The man doesn't know the definition of hyperbole. </em></p>, <p><em>Chris Matthews, MSNBC host: I think a lot of us have been very supportive of Mueller and what he's done. He has worked very hard and done a really good job. </em></p>, <p>Man, can they suck up when they want to! A man never stands so tall when he stoops to kiss a butt. That's their motto. It's unbelievable.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">When Robert Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>But you may be slightly confused, listening to all this. Democrats are demanding impeachment, and the press strongly agrees with that. They love Robert Mueller. But what will the crime be, exactly? What would the charges be in an impeachment proceeding? Would it be Russian collusion, the core charge?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Well, as Mueller himself conceded, there's no evidence that ever happened.</p>, <p>""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,"" he said during his public statement. ""This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.""</p>, <p>""Insufficient evidence."" In other words, there was no crime. That's how it works. The same is true for obstruction, by Mueller's own admission. After two years, he and his subordinates were unable to find a criminal act.</p>, <p>""The report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president,"" Mueller said. ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""</p>, <p>""Under longstanding department policy, a present president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,"" Mueller added. ""That is unconstitutional. The Special Counsel's Office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""</p>, <p>Yes, got that. We knew that, in fact.</p>, <p>And just to be clear, prosecutors in civilized countries don't prove people innocent. They don't need to do that. That's the standing presumption that all of us have by virtue of our citizenship. Instead, prosecutors look for evidence of guilt, and if there is no evidence of guilt, a person is declared not guilty. That's how our system works.</p>, <p>So when Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>Yet, Mueller would clearly like to see the president impeached anyway. Democrats are likely to take him up on that.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on May 29, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">It’s clear the president wants to deal roughly with China but consider the cost. Contrary to Trump’s statements that China pays the tariffs, American consumers bear the brunt.</p>, <p class=""advert-txt"">Advertisement</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">One estimate by academics from Yale, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and Columbia calculate that tariffs already added $69 billion in annual costs for Americans consumers, before the latest escalation. The National Bureau of Economic Research says that an all-out trade war could eventually cost more than $300 billion.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Estimates indicate that the average American household will pay at least $500 extra this year because of tariffs already imposed. Escalation to an all-out trade war will raise that tab to $2,200.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Jobs will be hit hard, too, with upwards of 455,000 jobs put at risk because of this costly conflict. In the end, tariffs hit consumers hardest and compel American firms to pull back on expansion and innovation. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">China’s retaliatory tariffs will also negatively affect America’s energy exports to China. The Energy Information Administration reported that U.S. oil exports ultimately plummeted in 2018 since China’s importers essentially shunned American energy producers. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The retaliatory tariffs will also jeopardize American investment in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and consequently restrict America’s contribution to the growing LNG market. The damage to farm exports is well known and at best the administration can offer temporary relief through stockpiling programs.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">To be sure, the U.S. must have a strategy for China. But China does not pose an “existential threat” to America. If it did, an approach much stronger than tariffs would be warranted.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Making China an enemy is a sure way to isolate America from much of Asia and Africa, as well as parts of Latin America and Europe. That’s not a prescription for ensuring that the United States remains the indispensable global power. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">The solutions? America’s best answer to Chinese competition is a strong U.S. economy that promotes innovation. We were headed in that direction through meaningful tax reform.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Specific reprisals to answer Chinese trade and investment misbehavior are the right response, not broad protectionist tariffs. We can afford no further escalation of the tariff war with China. Instead of a fresh tariff volley, President Trump should encourage free and fair trade with China through a comprehensive agreement.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">If China does not fulfill its side of the new bargain, President Trump can target offending Chinese companies – private or state-owned – with specific reprisals rather than renewing all-out tariffs that injure American firms and workers.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">In the coming days, the president has a significant opportunity to calm American markets and ensure that the U.S. economy continues to prosper.

      <span class=""copyright"">(AP Photo)</span></p>, <p>“The ripple of one crime like this has been phenomenal,” Wrenn continued. “The first responders that had to remove the children from the oil tanks — they’ll never be the same. Some of the investigators I know had struggled to return to their jobs and go about investigations the same way.”</p>, <p>The terrifying turn of events first occurred with the disappearance of Shanann Watts and the children in August. But within days, the patriarch was arrested and then pleaded guilty in exchange for prosecutors not seeking the death penalty. At the time, Watts didn’t provide a full account of what occurred or his motives.</p>, <p>

However, he later admitted that was a lie and he was solely responsible for the murders.</p>, <p>According to Watts, he strangled Shanann in their bed on Aug. 14 after he told her their marriage was over and she allegedly said he would never see their children again. He said his wife suspected he was having an affair, which was true. However, Watts claimed he didn’t tell her about the ongoing relationship with a co-worker before killing her.</p>, <p>

Still, the relationship may have “contributed” to his actions.</p>, <p>Wrenn said the first responders weren’t the only ones shaken by Watts’ actions.</p>, <p>“[Also] those who had to attend the autopsies the next day,” said Wrenn. “Those of us who had to sit and be frustrated by the fact that Chris Watts refused to tell us the truth in the initial interview. We knew he was lying, we knew he was involved. We wanted to find those kids and find Shanann. We knew he held the answers to those questions. His denials and the arrogance contained within those denials — I don’t know if I’ve ever been more frustrated in my life watching something take place.”</p>, <p>Watts confessed that after he strangled Shanann, Bella came into the couples’ bedroom clutching a blanket, asking what was wrong with her mother. Watts responded the matriarch wasn’t feeling well. Bella then watched as Watts wrapped the body in a bed sheet and started crying when he pulled it down the stairs of their home. Watts said he put the corpse on the floor of his truck’s back set. Celeste then woke up from the commotion.</p>, <p>

Each child had their own blanket and Celeste also brought along a stuffed animal.</p>, <p>Watts drove to about 40 miles east of the family’s home in Frederick to an oil worksite where he worked as an operator for an oil and gas producer. Watts told police he pulled Shannon’s body from the truck while the girls asked, “What are you doing to mommy?”</p>, <p>Watts then said he went back to the truck and used Celeste’s blanket to smother her as Bella watched from a seat beside her sister. Then, he put Celeste’s body inside an oil tank. He then returned to the truck and smothered Bella using the same blanket. He told police Bella’s last words were “Daddy, no!” as she struggled under the blanket. He then put her body inside another oil tank and buried Shanann's body nearby.</p>, <p>Watts alleged he did not plan to murder his family.</p>, <p>
      According to court documents released, Shanann Watts' body was found in a shallow grave near this oil tank Aug. 21, 2018, near Roggen, Colorado. Both of her daughter's bodies, 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, were submerged for days in the same oil tanks in rural eastern Colorado, prosecutors said.

      <!-- --></p>, <p>“I do agree that this crime can only be committed by a sociopath,” said Wrenn. “There’s no other possible explanation.”</p>, <p>Wrenn insisted that despite Watts’ tell-all to investigators, we may never truly know why he was willing to slaughter his entire family.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ted-bundy-ex-girlfriend-extremely-wicked-elizabeth-kloepfer"" target=""_blank""><strong>TED BUNDY'S EX-GIRLFRIEND INSPIRES HAUNTING FILM</strong></a></p>, <p>“When he gave that post-conviction prison interview to the FBI, I think we do get some glimpses into the why,” he explained. “But when you engage in an act that his so horrific and is so far removed from anything the average person ever contemplates doing to their own children, the why is going to be so elusive. It’s nonsensical. It’s so contrary to everything we know about human nature. And for that reason, the why is never going to be satisfying.”</p>, <p>

      <!-- --></p>, <p>“I’m speculating, but based on his own words [he spoke out] because there was a sense of… the cleansing of the conscious,” he continued. “He was trying to come to grips with his future and his faith… Sometimes that happens in a case… there is a desire to let the truth come out. I don’t know if everything he said in that interview was the truth. I don’t know if we’ll ever know [why].

He then alleged to keeping photos of his slain family in his cell and talks to them “every morning and every night.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/survivors-of-larry-nassars-sexual-abuse-speak-out-doc-on-gymnastics-scandal-hbo-doc"" target=""_blank""><strong>SURVIVORS OF LARRY NASSAR'S SEXUAL ABUSE SPEAK OUT IN FILM</strong></a></p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Colorado Bureau of Investigation)</span></p>, <p>“The crime affected a lot of people,” said Wrenn. ""Locally and nationally. Our initial instinct is to want to understand the why. I don’t think a documentary is capable of providing that answer, but maybe it will shed some light on the bigger picture… the factual backdrop in which such a horrific act can be committed.""</p>, <p>“When you looked into his day-to-day activities, the guy would get up, go to work, go home, play with his kids, talk on the phone with his buddies about fantasy football, send text messages throughout the day to his wife about their weekend plans — we can all relate to that lifestyle,” he added. “That’s different from what we normally see in criminal investigations. It’s hard to relate to the people we are investigating because their lives often look so different from ours. Chris Watts’ life didn’t look that much different from the people who were investigating it.”</p>, <p><em>""Family Man, Family Murderer: An ID Murder Mystery"" airs Sunday, June 2 at 10 p.m. on ID.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">At the height of the Cold War in 1984, a quintessential blonde southern California club girl left to spend a week in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). It was a week that would not only transform her life, but shape the Russian rock scene and bring its style and sounds to the United States.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">“After one rock festival, I went to the Leningrad Rock Club. Two guys in suits grabbed me after the concert and took me to the basement to question me,” the now-retired 58-year-old rocker Joanna Stingray, born Joanna Fields, told Fox News. “I continuously told them that I don’t speak Russian and I didn’t understand what they were asking. They finally asked in English who I was and how I got into the club.”</p>, <p>
      Underground St. Petersburg music scene
      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>Despite the rocky start – no pun intended – with KGB spy operatives, Stingray fell hard for the covert punk scene emerging through the cracks of the Cold War in Leningrad, President Vladimir Putin’s native city, now known as St. Petersburg. Stingray went on to build tight friendships with others leading the music genre, sneaking over U.S.-made instruments and coveted California clothing items with every subsequent visit.</p>, <p>“Sometimes there are fragments of time in history that become iconic, like the ’60s in San Francisco. But this magic was happening in Leningrad in the mid-1980s, and there was nothing like it since,” she reminisced. “It was like I was in Wonderland. It was full of surprise and creativity.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/world/jailed-iranian-musician-rebuffs-regimes-music-ban-by-releasing-album-about-war-and-oppression"" target=""_blank"">JAILED IRANIAN MUSICIAN REBUFFS REGIME'S BAN BY RELEASING ALBUM ABOUT WAR AND OPPRESSION</a></p>, <p>She was determined to evade authorities and bring surprise to the Western world. At the height of global tensions induced by the Cold War, Stingray smuggled out – in the heels of her boots – unofficial recordings of four of the top Soviet rock bands, which she went on to release with the album title “Red Wave.” It became the first of the Soviet Rock albums to infiltrate the Western market in June, 1986 and was a hit that <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-22-ca-20508-story.html"" target=""_blank"">sent ripples</a> through the larger rock arena.</p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>Today, she is often credited as a pioneer for bringing Russian rock to the Western world and cementing a common love of music amid the tension-wracked war period.</p>, <p>But because it was an American woman who had illicitly done the legwork of bringing the genre to the outside world, and not the Soviet leadership itself, featured “Red Wave” musicians were apparently made to sign official documents that maneuvered the blame solely on Stingray.</p>, <p>Soon thereafter, in early 1987, she was suddenly slapped with a six-month ban from the USSR, which meant missing her planned wedding to fellow music man Yuri Kasparyan, the guitarist from the rock group Kino.</p>, <p>“I became an Enemy of the State and was not allowed into Russia and missed my wedding,” Stingray recalled. “They never told me why.”</p>, <p>

      <span class=""copyright"">(Courtesy Joanna Stingray)</span></p>, <p>And just as she had outworn her welcome in the USSR, Stingray said her jaunts in and out didn’t sit well with U.S. officials, either.</p>, <p>“I was questioned by the FBI twice in the years before 1987. I kept telling them I was only doing music, but they didn’t believe anyone would go to Russia every three months unless they were a spy,” she contended.</p>, <p>Undeterred, Stingray continued her underground Russian rock life, eventually marrying – and divorcing Kasparyan – before returning to a quiet California life in 1996, where she went on to have a family, dabble in real estate and helm the Beverly Hills High School Alumni association.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/us/nuclear-weapons-risk-escalating-debate-over-vintage-u-s-arsenal"" target=""_blank"">AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS RISK ESCALATES, DEBATE GROWS ABOUT 'VINTAGE' US ARSENAL</a></strong></p>, <p>

Trips range anywhere from about $30,000 for locally-based operators to well over $100,000 for tours with amenities such as private guides and personal photographers, according to various estimates. In most cases, foreign climbers also have to cover the costs of climbing equipment, personal injury and helicopter insurance, as well as a $11,000 permit fee to goes the Nepalese government. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">At least 11 people have died while attempting to scale the world’s tallest summit, marking the mountain’s deadliest climbing season since 2015. While experts attribute the trend to several factors, including weather conditions, historically low prices from operators with inexperienced or unqualified guides are luring climbers into a dangerous situation, according to Alan Arnette, a Colorado-based summit coach and blogger who scaled Everest in 2011.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“With operators now offering climbs at $30,000 compared to the ‘old-school’ price of $45,000 to $65,000, people who simply can’t afford to gain the much-needed mountaineering and altitude experience on lesser peaks, believing it’s not needed, jump on the low-cost Everest train,” Arnette said in an email to FOX Business and other news outlets.</p>, <p class=""foxbusiness_mid_article_caption tl-caption"" style=""color:#222;text-align:left !important;display: -webkit-box;-webkit-line-clamp: 3;-webkit-box-orient: vertical;overflow: hidden;font-size:16px;line-height:24px;"">

</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">This year’s deaths, most of which have been linked to altitude sickness, occurred as Nepal’s government issued a record 381 permits to climbers. Veterans have argued that inexperienced climbers are causing traffic jams on the mountain’s narrow trails, putting themselves and others at risk. </p>, <p class=""advert-txt"">Advertisement</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Nepal, which earns roughly $300 million each year from climbing expeditions, places few limits on which applicants can receive permits. Climbers simply need to cover the $11,000 fee and provide proof from a doctor that they are medically fit. According to Arnette, cheaper operators often hire guides who lack the experience needed to respond during an emergency.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“The solution lies in governments having strict qualification on who can guide and climb and not simply accepting their money without question. You have to qualify for the Boston Marathon, but not to climb the world’s highest peak,” Arnette said.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">Aside from insurance coverage, high-end operators often require clients to have demonstrated climbing experience. </p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">For example, <a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.mountainguides.com/pdf/Everest.pdf"" target=""_blank"">International Mountain Guides<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a> warns applicants that they must be “in excellent physical condition, with good technical skills and previous altitude experience” to attempt a climb. <a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://asian-trekking.com/mountaineering-expedition-nepal/eco-everest-expedition"" target=""_blank"">Asian Trekking<span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a>, a local operator, requires at least six months of preparation to ensure climbers are fit enough to contend with low oxygen levels.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">""The combination of untrained sherpas and inexperienced climbers is a lethal cocktail but luckily there are better-equipped companies to rally around in case of accidents,"" Asian Trekking managing director Dawa Steven Sherpa told AFP in 2016.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">As deaths mount, Nepalese officials signaled this week that they could alter laws to place more restrictions on which climbers and operators can attempt the trek.</p>, <p data-v-54a96eec=""""><a data-aesra-score=""linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;linkNewWindowWarning:1;"" href=""https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX BUSINESS APP</strong><span class=""ae-compliance-indent ae-new-window"" data-ae-pem-ignore=""true"" style=""display: none;""> Opens a New Window. </span></a></p>, <p data-v-54a96eec="""">“It’s time to review all the old laws,” Nepalese parliament member Yagya Raj Sunuwar said, according to the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/world/asia/mount-everest.html"" style=""color:#0563c1; text-decoration:underline"">New York Times</a>. </p>, <p>Click the button below to comment on this article.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Unfunded pension liabilities per capita in Connecticut are more than $32,800.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">Historically low prices from operators with inexperienced or unqualified guides are luring climbers into a dangerous situation.</p>, <p data-v-7cf20f0a="""">A car may be one of the biggest purchases you’ll make this year.

Recall that it was Krugman, a Nobel Prize winner, who predicted that Trump’s election would trigger “a global recession.” One continues to wait in vain for an “I was wrong” statement from him.</p>, <p>The Economist, a center-left British magazine that includes coverage of events in the U.S. and is no fan of the Trump administration, recently published a remarkable editorial that contains gems Republicans should quote between now and the next election. They include a strong rebuke to the contention of many Democrats that “working people” are still struggling and that the improved economy continues to benefit only the wealthiest 1 percent.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-obama-biden-economy-astounding-numbers""><strong>TRUMP 'OWNS' ECONOMY OF 'ASTOUNDING NUMBERS,' NOT OBAMA OR BIDEN, GOP EX-LAWMAKER SAYS</strong></a></p>, <p>The bleak picture painted by Democrats, the editorial says, “is at odds with reality.” The Economist refers to a worldwide “jobs boom” and (note to Bernie Sanders and others promoting socialism) asserts that “Capitalism is improving workers’ lot faster than it has in years ... the zeitgeist has lost touch with the data.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.</p>, <p>Noting that U.S. unemployment at 3.6 percent is the lowest in 50 years, the magazine says that ""Less appreciated is the abundance of jobs across most of the rich world.""</p>, <p>A more educated population, the matching by websites of jobs to qualified applicants, and, yes, economic stimulus efforts that helped fuel the emergence of economies from the last recession have all contributed to the American economy and many European economies.</p>, <p>Then there is this, which has been the gospel of conservatives for decades when it comes to welfare and its disincentive for many to find work: ""reforms to welfare programs, both to make them less generous and to toughen eligibility tests, seem to have encouraged people to seek work.""</p>, <p>This has forced liberal politicians to shift their focus from the unemployed to the “quality” of jobs. British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is quoted as saying, “Our jobs market is being turned into a sea of insecurity.”</p>, <p>“Reality begs to differ,” says The Economist. “Official projections” predict that by 2026, “America will have more at-home careers than secretaries.” Jobs and the skills necessary to fill them are changing, but not so rapidly that workers — and especially younger people — cannot adjust their education and training to match the new requirements.</p>, <p>Wages are rising almost everywhere, and, as the editorial says, tight labor markets “lead firms to fish for employees in neglected pools, including among ex-convicts. ... American wonks fretted for years about how to shrink the disability-benefit rolls. Now the hot labor market is doing it for them.”</p>, <p>This is the argument that conservatives, many Republicans and the Trump administration have been making for some time. Economic growth, not government, raises most boats.</p>, <p>While acknowledging “The jobs boom will not last forever” and that a recession will eventually “kill it off,” the editorial concludes that the economic boom “deserves a little appreciation.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>It deserves more than that and would be more than appreciated if it all happened under a Democratic president.

The president has also eclipsed his predecessor in terms of working on issues Americans believe to be important.</p>, <p>According to the article: “Gallup found that  47% agree with Trump on the issues, edging President Barack Obama at the two year mark of his presidency. In April 2007, 45% agreed with Obama on issues, said Gallup. And Trump was graded more in line with the political ideology of Americans than Obama and former President George W. Bush. Asked about Trump’s ideology, 38% said it was ‘about right.’ Some 35% said the same thing about Obama, and 36% for Bush.”</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-low-unemployment-strong-job-creation-confirm-strength-of-trump-economy""><strong>NEWT GINGRICH: LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, STRONG JOB CREATION CONFIRM STRENGTH OF TRUMP ECONOMY</strong></a></p>, <p>These are remarkable numbers. They violate the Washington elites’ view of Trump as an unacceptable outsider. If almost half the country agrees with Trump on issues – and more Americans think he is more in line with their ideology than either President Obama or President George W.

With another year of improvement, this may cease to be an issue.</p>, <p>Faced with the strengths of the economy and of President Trump on the issues, the Democrats have two likely paths in 2020.</p>, <p>If they nominate someone like former Vice President Joe Biden, who tries to stay closer to the middle than the left-wing of his party, they run the risk of an election like the one in which former Vice President Walter Mondale was crushed in 1984. </p>, <p>A mild personality that does not stir up passion is fine – until there is a storm. Then, support melts away. Mondale discovered this when he promised to raise taxes. Biden will almost certainly have to endorse some radical positions to hold his party together if he becomes the nominee. Those will then define him, since his mildness will have failed to imprint a strong definition.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>The more likely future is that Democrats will nominate a non-Biden candidate, who is dedicated to stirring up the left by adopting radical positions. In that case, he or she will resemble George McGovern, who was crushed when the country perceived he was too left-wing to be president.</p>, <p>Republicans trying to recapture the House of Representatives and working to increase the Senate GOP majority should study Bedard’s and Rattner’s analyses and start planning for an election in which they have a strong tailwind for the GOP ticket.

Insight from Gene Marks, president of the Marks group.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Most Americans – and many members of Congress – have no idea just how badly the world cheats us with high tariffs and nonreciprocal trade. That's why I recommend everybody read the just-released eye-opening report from the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"" target=""_blank"">White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy</a>.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Stunningly, this report finds that across more than 100 countries stretching from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to China, India, and Vietnam, American farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers face systematically higher tariffs on their exports than foreign competitors face when exporting to America. Astonishingly, these nonreciprocal tariffs are perfectly legal under the unfair rules of the broken-down World Trade Organization (WTO).</p>, <p>Take <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/auto"" target=""_blank"">autos</a> for example. The U.S. levies a tariff of only 2.5 percent on foreign imports but the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe"" target=""_blank"">European Union</a> (EU) erects a tariff barrier four times higher – all with the WTO’s blessing! No wonder we’re inundated with Audis and Beemers and VWs. Even when German automakers build assembly plants here in the U.S., they still manufacture the high value-added, high-wage parts like engines and transmission on German soil.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-china-trade-deal-ambassador-cui-tiankai"" target=""_blank"">CHINA 'COMMITTED' TO FORGING NEW TRADE DEAL WITH TRUMP, COUNTRY'S AMBASSADOR TELLS FOX NEWS</a></strong></p>, <p>It’s not just in manufactured goods where America is getting robbed by high nonreciprocal tariffs. When an Arkansas or Louisiana rice farmer tries to export to Malaysia, it’s a 40 percent tariff. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin dairy farmers face a 67 percent European tariff. And South Carolina green tea exported to Thailand faces a 90 percent tariff.</p>, <p>These high nonreciprocal tariffs mean more factories and jobs offshore and less investment and growth in the U.S. than we otherwise could achieve. That’s why in his 2019 <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/state-of-the-union"" target=""_blank"">State of the Union address</a>, President Trump urged Congress to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act (USRTA).</p>, <p>Introduced by Rep. Sean Duffy. R-Wis., last January, the USRTA would give the president the authority to raise tariffs to reciprocal or “mirror” levels if foreign countries refuse to lower their tariffs to U.S. levels. Ask any American on Main Street if he or she thinks this is a good idea, and most are likely to answer ""yes.""</p>, <p>A nationwide Harvard-Harris poll found that 81 percent of respondents support the USRTA, with little partisan difference. If members of Congress voted the views of Main Street rather than their Wall Street donors, the USRTA would pass by a similar or greater margin.</p>, <p>Of course, I’m not going to hold my breath on that possibility. Unlike President Trump, Congress has been out of touch with the American people on the trade issue for decades. How else do you explain the fact that Congress as an institution gave us three of the worst trade deals in American history – the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), China's entry into the WTO in 2001, and the 2012 South Korean free-trade agreement?</p>, <p>How would Congress passing the USRTA benefit America? The new White House report estimates that over $50 billion would be shaved off the trade deficit. With about 6,000 new jobs created per billion dollars of trade deficit reductions, this would lead to more than 300,000 new jobs created.</p>, <p>A lower trade deficit would also mean faster growth from fewer imports, more domestic production, and more exports. In the first quarter of 2019, the real gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.2 percent. One point of that growth was due to a more favorable trade balance – primarily because of the China tariffs.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>The new White House report also finds that the auto and agricultural sectors would benefit the most from passage of the USRTA. Both sectors would see a jump in exports by almost 10 percent.</p>, <p>These findings by the White House underscore why we need to let Trump be Trump on trade policy so he can level the international playing field and fix the broken World Trade Organization policies. The USRTA would provide him with an important new tool, and both sides of the congressional aisle should stop playing petty politics and put the American worker first by passing this legislation immediately.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/l/corey-lewandowski"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY COREY LEWANDOWSKI</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

His morning Twitter rants often include barbs aimed at China. And he has a bipartisan batch of legislators cheering him on.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has urged Trump to ""hang tough on China,"" as ""strength is the only way to win.""</p>, <p>And <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lindsey-graham"">Sen. Lindsey Graham</a>, R-S.C., has told the president, ""We're behind you!""</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-china-trade-deal-ambassador-cui-tiankai""><strong>CHINA 'COMMITTED' TO FORGING NEW TRADE DEAL WITH TRUMP, COUNTRY'S AMBASSADOR TELLS FOX NEWS</strong></a></p>, <p>Toughness has its merits, but it also has its limits. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were certainly tough when they emerged from their hideout and began shooting at the Bolivian soldiers who had surrounded them. But sometimes it is better to look for smart <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/global-economy/trade"">strategies</a> rather than tough ones.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, Trump's approach to the China trade issue is tough but unlikely to be effective. It relies exclusively on unilateral tariffs, and as a result, any deal that is reached will not be the best one possible. Instead of pushing him to come out with guns blazing, members of Congress should argue for a strategy that would work much better: Cooperating with allies to put more greater pressure on China.</p>, <p>There is widespread agreement around the world that China engages in protectionist and other problematic trade practices: failure to protect intellectual property adequately; high tariffs; restrictions on foreign investment; forcing foreign investors to transfer technology to their joint venture partners; industrial subsidies; state-owned enterprises that compete unfairly; and opaque regulatory practices that can be used to discriminate against foreign companies.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns our allies into foes. </p>, <p>The only debate is about what to do about this. The Trump administration has chosen to go it alone, by imposing tariffs on China in a way that violates the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In the view of the Trump administration, these tariffs have ""forced China to the negotiating table,"" but that is a misconception, as the Obama administration was already in the midst of its own negotiations on investment with China (which the Trump administration seems to have abandoned).</p>, <p>Regardless, so far the only outcome from Trump's tariffs has been economic pain on both sides, as China has retaliated with tariffs of its own: consumers in both countries pay higher prices, and many producers in both countries suffer as their exports are suddenly at a disadvantage.</p>, <p>The administration has convinced many people in Washington that tariffs were the last resort, because nothing else has worked with China. But this talking point from the administration is wrong. In fact, there are better options that have not been tried yet.</p>, <p>The first important change in strategy is that confronting China would work much better if undertaken through a coordinated effort. The Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Japanese, Brazilians and many others all have concerns about Chinese trade practices. The administration should reach out to those allies and work together.</p>, <p>A key part of this coordinated effort will be to remove the tariffs and quotas imposed on these allies under the Section 232 statute, ostensibly for ""national security"" purposes, but generally recognized as being simple protectionism. These countries are less inclined to work with us on problems with China when we are attacking them on trade as well. The Trump administration has just removed the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports, but tariffs on other countries remain in place.</p>, <p>After organizing this group effort, the United States and its allies should take a two-pronged approach: file complaints against China at the WTO under the various provisions that apply here (China is under greater obligations than most countries, as per the terms of its accession), and negotiate new rules in a multilateral agreement with China.</p>, <p>An important part of the negotiation is that the United States and its allies have to be willing to give something. A one-sided deal is difficult for any country to accept, and this is certainly the case for China, given its history with unequal trade treaties with Western countries. For example, in exchange for China lowering its tariffs, the United States and its allies could agree to abandon the special, more onerous, calculation method used for China and a few other countries when setting anti-dumping duties.</p>, <p>Beyond the negotiations with China, the United States should also be negotiating trade liberalization directly with these same trading partners. The preferential trading arrangements that result would put China at a disadvantage and put pressure on it to liberalize. Unilateral tariffs have led to Chinese tariffs in response, but tariff liberalization could put pressure on China to pursue its own liberalization so as not to be at a disadvantage.</p>, <p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that the Obama administration worked on were examples of this. So far, however, the Trump administration has mostly spent time tweaking existing trade agreements. Putting the emphasis on new liberalization of this kind would have its own benefits, but would also be useful for encouraging a deal with China.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products""> <strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p>, <p>If none of that works, then tough tactics — a unified front to impose new tariffs on China or a discussion of whether China belongs in the WTO — are appropriate. But the Trump administration's approach has ignored or undermined these smarter options.  The first step is to abandon the current, flawed approach, which has led only to tariffs in both directions.</p>, <p>It is possible to push China in the continued direction of reform. Think about the progress it has made since 1978. But reform in China will not happen with a trade policy that slaps tariffs on all U.S. trading partners and turns our allies into foes.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

As direct and unambiguous as those words are -- the Constitution as amended is the supreme law of the land -- Congress and the courts have not always been faithful to them.</p>, <p>Thus, at the height of the anti-immigrant hysteria whipped up by President Woodrow Wilson and his supporters, Congress enacted the Espionage Act of 1917, which punished speech deemed harmful to America's war efforts. Wilson was determined to win the First World War at the price of the suppression of ideas that he hated or feared.</p>, <p>The Espionage Act was used aggressively and successfully (from Wilson's vantage point) during the war and in the immediate years following.</p>, <p>Then, a series of Supreme Court decisions instructed that the Act is probably unconstitutional as its sole purpose and effect is to suppress speech. These opinions harkened back to Madison, who believed that the only moral and constitutional remedy for hateful or harmful or even seditious speech was not suppression and punishment but rather more speech.</p>, <p>That attitude prevailed generally in the legal and judicial communities and at the Department of Justice for a few generations -- even during World War II -- until now.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Now, the Trump DOJ has indicted a non-American whose alleged crimes took place in Europe for numerous violations of the Espionage Act, and it has done so in direct defiance of a Supreme Court decision that ruled against this during the Nixon years.</p>, <p>The non-American is <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/julian-assange"" target=""_blank"">Julian Assange</a>, a radical and unorthodox publisher of truthful information that often exposes the hypocrisy of government. His entity for exposure is WikiLeaks -- the website known for receiving stolen data and for posting true and accurate copies of them.</p>, <p>It was Assange and WikiLeaks that published the infamous Democratic National Committee emails in October 2016, which contained the ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton once offered by Russian agents to Trump campaign officials, and for which then-candidate Trump lavished public praise on WikiLeaks.</p>, <p>Yet, back in 2010, Assange arranged to receive and publish stolen copies of top-secret military materials that revealed American military personnel in Afghanistan at their worst. It showed them knowingly killing innocent civilians -- and doing so gleefully.</p>, <p>The data that Assange revealed had been stolen for him by an Army private then named <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chelsea-manning-will-go-back-to-jail-after-refusing-to-testify-to-grand-jury-probing-wikileaks"" target=""_blank"">Bradley Manning</a>. Manning was tried and convicted of the theft and was sentenced to 35 years in a military prison, much of it in solitary confinement. In January 2017, President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence to time served.</p>, <p>If this sounds a bit like history repeating itself from the Nixon years, it is. In 1971, Daniel Ellsberg, a civilian employee of the Nixon Department of Defense, revealed that he had stolen thousands of pages of top-secret materials showing that former President Lyndon B. Johnson and some of his generals had serially lied to the American public and to Congress about the Vietnam War.</p>, <p>When he delivered the stolen materials to The New York Times and to The Washington Post for publication, and the Nixon DOJ got wind of the delivery, it persuaded two federal judges to enjoin the publication of the documents.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">In a landmark decision, known as the Pentagon Papers case, the Supreme Court ruled that a publisher may reveal whatever materials come into the publisher's possession, no matter how they got there, so long as the materials are themselves material to the public interest.</p>, <p>Stated differently, the thief -- Ellsberg then, Manning today -- can be tried for theft, but the publisher is absolutely protected by the ""no law"" language of the First Amendment.</p>, <p>Ellsberg was indicted and prosecuted, but the charges were dismissed by a federal judge whose conscience was shocked when he learned that FBI agents broke into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist to get ""dirt"" on him.</p>, <p>Assange is also protected by the values underlining that ""no law"" language. The whole purpose of the First Amendment, numerous courts have written, is to promote and provoke open, wide, robust political debate about the policies of the government.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>That simply cannot be done when the government operates in secret.

The sprawling report is 448 pages long, however. In his nine-minute address, Mueller quite consciously highlighted the portions of the report that fuel the Democrats’ calls for impeachment.</p>, <p>Mueller was adamant that he did not make a finding on whether President Trump should be charged with obstruction of justice because the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued guidance forbidding the indictment of a sitting president.

He then emphasized that he did not say so. That strongly implies that he believes the evidence is sufficient (notwithstanding that the attorney general has found otherwise). Mueller added that, in deciding not to allege obstruction even though the evidence was arguably sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he relied on the OLC guidance. Finally, he deduced from this, and from his understanding of the Constitution, that in our system it is for Congress, not federal prosecutors, to deal with presidential misconduct.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/robert-mueller-press-conference-impeachment-politics-democrats/""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW</strong></a></p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/m/andrew-mccarthy""><strong>CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY</strong></a></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Few D.C. politicians understand that because they are used to patronizing Americans with lip service and a check.</p>, <p>Now let me be clear, I understand why President Trump issued this aid, the second round since July of last year when the government allocated $12 billion to offset the plight.</p>, <p>Do I think a multi-billion dollar farm subsidy or bailout will fix the problem? No.</p>, <p>But President Trump had to do something to shut up the beltway Democrats and media hacks who launched an anti-Trump smear campaign blaming him for farmer’s woes.</p>, <p>Yes, the trade negotiations with China have certainly been a factor BUT consider this: corn, soybean and wheat prices began their decline in mid-2012, long before Trump took office and imposed tariffs.</p>, <p>Why? Well, there's no single answer for that but overproduction had a lot to do with it.</p>, <p>Our farmers have been planting and preparing enough crops to feed the world and yes, trade uncertainty threw a wrench in the process.</p>, <p>But here’s something else to consider -- although our imports on grain, corn, and soybeans are indeed very low, why are we importing AT ALL?</p>, <p>If we produce enough of those crops to feed the world AND have an overproduction surplus, why import at all, even a tiny amount?</p>, <p>Guess what else we import a lot of in recent years -- beef products.</p>, <p>Follow the money. American cattle ranches rely on American farmers for feed. The American cattleman has been royally screwed over by foreign beef imports with many ranchers run completely out of business.</p>, <p>In fact, according to data compiled by American Cattlemen advocacy group RCALF, we have eliminated over 175,000 cattle farms and ranches since 1994, the year we entered NAFTA.</p>, <p>Consequently, we have 8.5 million fewer cattle today than we had in 1994. Those missing cows would be eating a lot of corn.</p>, <p>Also, if we were raising and feeding the half-a-million cattle that we import each year for immediate slaughter, there would be additional demand for crops that could have fed those animals, right here in the U.S.</p>, <p>Fewer American cattle ranchers leads to less demand for American feed and hence, we now have an over-abundance of corn, grain, and wheat.</p>, <p>A surplus drives down prices and hits our American farmers in the pocketbook. It is all linked.</p>, <p>The USDA is planning a $100 million trade promotion program for livestock producers, yet, if you look at this latest $16-billion-dollar farm bailout, there are allowances for crops, dairy and hogs but NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH for American cattle ranchers.</p>, <p>President Trump, our ranchers don’t want a handout either but they would like that level playing field and you can make that happen, easily.</p>, <p>Under regulations Trump inherited from the Obama administration, the beef you find in a local grocery store can be labeled ‘Product of USA’ as long as it was packaged here.

Days later, Barr released a four-page summary of the findings, noting Mueller’s team found no evidence that members of the Trump campaign conspired with the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">An ancient rocky structure found at the heart of the Ross ice shelf helps determine where Antarctica's ice melts and where it stays firm and frozen.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">The structure is an old tectonic boundary, probably formed during the birth of the Antarctic continent or shortly thereafter. According to new research published May 27 in the journal Nature Geoscience, this boundary protects the ice shelf's grounding line, the point at which it is thick enough to extend all the way to the sea floor. The geology created by the boundary keeps warm, melt-promoting ocean water away from that part of the shelf. But the ocean circulation driven by that same geology drives intense summer melt along the shelf's easterly edge.</p>, <p>""We could see that the geological boundary was making the seafloor on the East Antarctic side much deeper than the West, and that affects the way the ocean water circulates under the ice shelf,"" study leader Kirsty Tinto, a research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, <a href=""https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-05/eiac-sus052419.php"" target=""_blank"">said in a statement</a>. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/64039-photos-antarctica.html"" target=""_blank"">Antarctica: The Ice-Covered Bottom of the World (Photos)</a>]</p>, <p>The Ross ice shelf is an expanse of ice 185,000 square miles (480,000) square kilometers) in area and hundreds of feet thick. Ice flows onto the shelf from the land-based East and West Antarctic Ice Sheets. Currently, the ice shelf is stable , Tinto and her colleagues wrote in Nature Geoscience, but geological and marine records show that is has collapsed in the distant past.</p>, <p>To understand the dynamics of the ice sheet, Tinto and her colleagues used data from an airplane-based tool called IcePod, which holds instruments that collect information on ice-shelf thickness and structure as well as instruments that detect magnetic and gravitational anomalies from the rock underlying the ice shelf. Magnetic minerals, for instance, found in magma and other rocky material under Antarctica, can change the magnetic-field readings in those spots, while undersea topography can affect gravitational readings. With this data, the researchers reconstructed a map of the ice shelf and the rock underneath. [<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/60801-photos-antarctica-dive.html"" target=""_blank"">Photos: Diving Beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf</a>]</p>, <p>They found a stark transition zone bisecting the ice sheet. If Antarctica were a wheel, the boundary would look a bit like a spoke, emanating from a spot a bit off-center. This transition zone is actually the line of demarcation between the geology of West Antarctica and East Antarctica. To the west, the rocks are a combination of sedimentary and magmatic, having formed from tectonic interactions, at the confluence of an oceanic and tectonic plate. East Antarctica is ancient continental material known as craton.</p>, <p>The newly discovered tectonic boundary bisecting the Ross ice shelf matters because it helps shape the seafloor beneath the ice. To the east, the seafloor is deeper, at 2,198 feet (670 meters), on average. To the west, the average depth is 1,837 feet (560 m), on average.</p>, <p>The researchers used a computer model to show how seawater circulates, given this new geologic knowledge. The good news is that the seafloor geometry keeps most warm ocean water away from the Ross ice shelf. Instead, an area of open sea called the Ross Shelf Polynya vents the warm, deep-ocean water, cooling it before it can flow beneath the ice shelf. But there is a lot of ice melt along the leading edge of the ice shelf (where it meets the sea), especially in the summer. The highest summer melt is near Ross Island, on the East Antarctic side.</p>, <p>So what does it all mean for a warming Antarctic? In the near future, the ice shelf's grounding line (the point at which it contacts the seafloor) should remain stable, at least in the face of moderate climate change, the researchers wrote. But variations in local climate will have a big impact on how fast the front edge of the ice shelf melts. These variations could include reductions in sea ice declines or cloud cover decreases, Laurie Padman, a senior scientist at Earth and Space Research in Oregon and study co-author, said in the statement.</p>, <p>""We found out that it's these local processes we need to understand to make sound predictions,"" Tinto said.</p>, <p><em>Originally published on </em><em> <a href=""https://www.livescience.com/65588-ancient-rocky-structure-beneath-antarctica.html"" target=""_blank"">Live Science</a></em>.</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

He went on to put out 16 more records.</p>, <p>His career got a boost in the early 1970s when Bob Dylan met him at the Mariposa Folk Festival in Ontario, Canada, and praised his performance.

He also sang theme songs for such works as ""Mr. Belvedere"" and ""Harry &amp; The Hendersons.""</p>, <p>In addition, he also voiced Leon the Snowman character in Will Ferrell’s beloved 2003 movie ""Elf,"" and did a duet with the movie's female lead, Zooey Deschanel, for “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.”</p>, <p>Redbone retired from performing in 2015 because his health had ""been a matter of concern for some time,"" a spokesman for the singer said at the time, and it was ""too challenging for him to continue the full range of professional activities.""</p>, <p>A 16-minute documentary about his life, ""Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,"" was released last year.</p>, <p>No further details about his death were available at the time of publication.</p>, <p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this story.</i></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Welcome to Alice in D.C. land. <br/><br/>
Robert Mueller, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/robert-mueller"" target=""_blank"">the special prosecutor</a>, told us Wednesday that he could not say if Donald Trump committed a crime. When I was in law school, I took a criminal procedure class. If I had said, the prosecutor could not prove that no crime was committed, I would have received an “F.""</p>, <p class=""speakable""><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hillary-clinton-says-democracy-feels-far-from-secure-blames-trump-administration"" target=""_blank"">HILLARY CLINTON SAYS DEMOCRACY 'FEELS FAR FROM SECURE' AT HUNTER COLLEGE COMMENCEMENT</a></strong></p>, <p><br/><br/>
In Washington, however, that qualifies you to be a special prosecutor. In D.C. Land, you get to turn the world upside down and claim moral righteousness.<br/><br/>
All of which bring us Hillary’s Hunter College commencement address. Still angry about her 2016 loss -- that was caused by so many people other than herself -- and with Trump in mind, Hillary condemned the administration for rejecting requests for testimony and documents from Democrats in Congress. <br/><br/>
She then asked, “What do we do when people in positions of authority are not held accountable?”<br/><br/>
Well, during the Obama administration, “we” did the following:<br/><br/>
1. “We” allowed Hillary to have a server that was hacked in her home that exposed classified information. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
2.  “We” allowed Hillary to bleach-bit her computer server, thereby destroying evidence under subpoena and obstructing justice. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
3.  “We” allowed Hillary not to turn over 17,448 messages including thousands of work messages – an obstruction of justice. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
4.  “We” allowed the Clinton Foundation to take in millions – some of which wound up in the accounts of Hillary and Bill while she was Secretary of State. She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
5. “We” allowed her to pay a law firm, to pay for the false dossier used to attack Trump – a clear campaign law violation (a candidate is required to disclose the true recipient of their expenditures not intermediaries). She was not held accountable.<br/><br/>
That list could go on and on but the result remains the same. The person demanding accountability was not held accountable for a series of provable acts.<br/><br/>
Of course, we should never forget how Hillary acted when her husband was under investigation. Hillary led what amounted to as a task force to discredit the accusers of Bill Clinton, which included witness intimidation, a form of obstruction, and at the same time she claims all women have the “right to be believed.”<br/><br/>
Mind you, that wasn’t all that Hillary said in her commencement address. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>
The illustrious alumna of an administration that spied on the press, spied on Americans using false dossiers and corrupt FISA applications, and the administration that harassed conservatives via the IRS, was not done yet.<br/><br/>
Hillary said, “Over the last two years, we’ve seen people wearing Nazi symbols once again . . .”<br/><br/>
The ""last two years"" is, of course, her way of saying that it is all the fault of Trump. Never mind that administration that she served committed untold abuses – when all else fails, including your moral clarity – claim the opposition is heinous, racist or even comprised of Nazis.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>Fortunately, Hillary lost because of who <em>she</em> is.  <br/><br/>

Despite the emergence of louse-borne typhus, <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/california"" target=""_blank"">Los Angeles</a> can’t seem to get its act together.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tammy-bruce-identity-politics-commencement"" target=""_blank"">TAMMY BRUCE: THE LEFT’S OBSESSION WITH IDENTITY POLITICS SINKS TO A SAD, NEW LOW</a></strong></p>, <p>Steve Lopez of the Los Angeles Times reported a week ago on the obscene condition of downtown Los Angeles, “A mountain of rotting, oozing, stinking trash … stretching a good 20 yards along a skid row alley. Rats popped their heads out of the debris like they were in a game of Whac-A-Mole, then scampered for cover as a tractor with a scoop lurched toward them. … The trash problem is not confined to any one street, but this particular location on the 800 block of Ceres Avenue is surrounded by food distribution companies that sell to shoppers, vendors, stores and restaurants. I counted seven within a block, so you have to wonder — given the colonies of football-size rats — about the potential contamination of the food supply chain and the spread of disease.”</p>, <p>What does the city say when confronted about the slow, or nonexistent, pace of cleanup?</p>, <p>A “spokeswoman for the city Department of Public Works said the backlog on service calls for trash pickup around homeless encampments sits at just under 8,400 currently. … ‘If it’s a homeless encampment, it’s a lengthier process because humans are involved and we have to meet certain protocols,’ she said, including a survey of who’s there, an inventory of personal property and notice of a cleanup,” the Times reported.</p>, <p>That’s right. Their concern for the people who are at ground zero for emerging deadly viruses is to follow protocols involving surveys and inventories. So don’t you worry — big government is keeping itself busy, as it behaves as though it’s normal to have more than 2,000 people sleeping on trash heaps, as potential epidemics lurk.</p>, <p>This is the idiotic disaster brought to you by unrestrained liberal leadership as it creates problems, then births a bureaucracy that will never deal with it.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">One glance at the formerly Golden State is a frightening embarrassment. The latest indictment of liberal leadership is the trash heap of Los Angeles.

The state actually has a budget surplus, but as we see, money can’t cure stupid.</p>, <p>Which brings us to Gov. Gavin Newsom and his plan. He’s outraged, just outraged at the “national disgrace” of California’s homelessness.</p>, <p>The Ventura County Star reported, “Gov. Gavin Newsom called growing homelessness in California a national disgrace as he announced Tuesday that he is launching a task force to find solutions amid a housing crisis in the most populous state.”</p>, <p>Like Los Angeles, instead of dealing with the reality of the problem, Newsom announced the creation of a task force, the members of which will travel around the state and make recommendations. There’s only one recommendation, and they won’t like it, that will change the state’s fate: a plea to all California voters to stop electing Democrats.</p>, <p>Yes, there’s nothing finer in a leader than the effort to blame everyone else for the scourge of homelessness your fellow Democrats have created over the years. California’s disaster isn’t a national disgrace, it’s not even California’s disgrace; it’s the disgrace of every liberal politician in the state who has led that state into medieval crisis.</p>, <p>Speaking of medieval crises, Dr. Drew Pinsky, the addiction medicine specialist, told Brian Kilmeade of Fox News that a deadly epidemic could emerge in Los Angeles during the summer months.</p>, <p>""I live in the great state of California, the utopia that is California, which is a nightmare,’ Pinsky said. ‘I want to give you a prediction here. There will be a major infectious disease epidemic this summer in Los Angeles.’ He continued, ‘We have tens and tens of thousands of people living in tents. Horrible conditions. Sanitation. Rats have taken over the city. We’re the only city in the country, Los Angeles, without a rodent control program. We have multiple rodent-borne, flea-borne illnesses, plague, typhus. We’re gonna have louse-borne illness. If measles breaks into that population, we have tuberculosis exploding. Literally, our politicians are like Nero. It’s worse than Nero,’ Pinsky said,” Fox News reported.</p>, <p>But it’s different now. Every Nero has a task force.</p>, <p>It’s so bad in California, even The New York Times deigned to allow an opinion piece decrying the growing instability of the state.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>In “America’s Cities Are Unlivable.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Our nation is at war. I’m not talking about an external battle -- we are in a war for our nation, our national security and its future. The battleground? The classroom.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">Our nation’s <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education"" target=""_blank"">education</a> system is failing, and it’s time to treat the problem as seriously as we would any external attack.</p>, <p>According to the Nation’s Report Card, two-thirds of our nation’s eighth-grade students are below proficiency in math. More than three-quarters are below proficiency in civics.</p>, <p>That should frighten every American.</p>, <p>Yet despite the grave state of our nation’s schools, people like <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders"" target=""_blank"">Sen. Bernie Sanders</a> are trying to kill a successful and popular public school option and restrict our educational system to only one vision of education, standing in the way of opportunity for more students, in the name of conformity.</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sanders-supporters-fearful-dnc-and-mainstream-media-colluding-against-americans"" target=""_blank""><strong>SANDERS SUPPORTERS FEARFUL DNC NOW BACKING BIDEN LIKE IT BACKED CLINTON: REPORT</strong></a></p>, <p>As part of his latest presidential campaign, Sanders has <a href=""http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/bernie-sanders-releases-plan-to-ban-for-profit-charter-schools"" target=""_blank"">proposed a moratorium </a>on federal funding for public charter schools. That makes no sense.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">Charter schools are one of the best weapons we have to educate children, particularly poor or minority children.</p>, <p>Studies from the University of Arkansas and many other institutions show that charter schools regularly outperform better than their public counterparts with less funding.</p>, <p>Sanders’s tirades about charter transparency (which of course exists), regulation (which charters have plenty of) and accountability (which is the very essence of charters) are both misinformed and counter-productive.</p>, <p>More importantly, Sanders’s proposal will disempower parents. New education options have seen an explosion of growth in the last two decades, and not because they’ve been foisted on communities and children by federal bureaucrats. It’s because parents in cities around the country have demanded the option to send their child to innovative, high-quality schools.</p>, <p>Just look at the black community, one of the most underserved populations in America. 86 percent of black parents support having more options in public education, including traditional public schools and charters. But many of those parents are hindered by the lack of available charter schools or by long wait lists.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The message has been clear and consistent: parents want more options, not fewer.</p>, <p>Education should not be about prioritizing one learning environment over another. Every asset is important in the battle, and our children can’t afford for us to play favorites. And yet powerful interest groups like teachers unions want us to believe that there’s only one way to educate students -- that a monolithic, top-down, centrally-controlled system is superior for every student. That’s simply not the case.</p>, <p>As Johns Hopkins professor Ashley Berner argues in her pathbreaking study of other countries, pluralism in education works. Countries that sponsor and support a wide array of educational options show not only equality of opportunity, but equality of results.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The U.S. is by nature a pluralistic country, and yet some behave -- including Sanders -- as if we should live in a dictatorship when it comes to education.</p>, <p>But we are not. We’re a pluralistic nation with thousands of different peoples, cultures, and habits.  Our education system should mirror the diversity that is America’s wealth and hallmark. We have fought to keep our nation the land of opportunity, and we must fight to ensure that opportunity exists in every venue, most notably in education.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>To win the war for education excellence, we cannot use only one type of weapon. We must put all of our assets on the battlefield, supporting any education program or organization that communities, parents, and educators can develop.</p>, <p>If the opponents of choice and educational progress had their way, our nation’s students will not have that future. The battles we wage are for them. Who are yours for, Senator?</p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Although the former special counsel popped up during a sleepy, holiday-shortened week in Washington, the ramifications extend long and well beyond.</p>, <p class=""speakable"">As the most visible leaders of a <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats"" target=""_blank"">Democratic Party</a> hellbent on ousting <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house"" target=""_blank"">President Trump</a> by any means necessary – including impeachment –  <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/nancy-pelosi"" target=""_blank"">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> and former <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden"" target=""_blank"">Vice President Joe Biden</a> felt the immediate aftershocks.</p>, <p>Both Pelosi and Biden have wisely handled the hot potato of impeachment with caution. As denizens of D.C. with a combined nearly 80 years in the Beltway, they have been through many a political fight. They know the perils of blundering headfirst into unwinnable battles. They were around during the 1990s for the failed GOP impeachment effort to end President Clinton. They watched it blow up in Republicans’ faces – and imperiled their congressional majority.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/colin-reed-elizabeth-warren-2020-campaign-win"" target=""_blank"">COLIN REED: ELIZABETH WARREN’S 2020 CAMPAIGN IS LOOKING UP AFTER A ROCKY START – BUT IS SHE IN IT TO WIN IT?</a></strong></p>, <p>It was no surprise that both held their course after Wednesday's news and continued pumping the brakes on the i-word.</p>, <p>If you’re Biden, owner of a commanding lead in both primary and general election polls, you know the easiest path to regaining power is through the ballot box next November. Critics on his left and his Democratic opponents may think otherwise but Biden presumably wouldn’t have entered a race he didn’t think was possible. A nasty and prolonged impeachment battle knocks him off his current trajectory, which one month into his candidacy, has exceeded all expectations.</p>, <p>If you’re Pelosi, whose political acumen is acknowledged by even her harshest critics in their quieter moments, you know you owe your gavel to the 31 purple districts that rejected Republican members of the House last year in favor of middle-of-the-road Democratic alternatives.</p>, <p>There’s no downside to beating the impeachment drum in Queens or Silicon Valley where the only threat to your congressional seat looms over your left shoulder in a primary. It’s a different calculus in the I-4 corridor of Florida or the farms of Virginia or the Orange County suburbs of California that once were the stomping ground of Ronald Reagan. These Democrats ended generations of GOP dominance last November running as a check on Trump – not as a supporter of Pelosi.</p>, <p>It’s been a decade since the summer of 2009 when Pelosi allowed an ill-advised vote on cap-and-trade that forced her vulnerable members to take a tough vote that cost many of them their jobs. Impeachment could have a similar effect, and once again cut Pelosi’s speakership short.</p>, <p>Ironically, the greatest threats to both Biden and Pelosi come not from the Republicans but from their own party. Several top-flight members of the 2020 wannabes used Wednesday as their ticket to board the impeachment train. No longer is  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a lonely voice in the wilderness beating the impeachment drum. She has company from fellow Senators, Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Cory Booker, D-N.J., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, among others. That list stands poised to grow, especially as next month’s first primary debate approaches, and candidates’ desperate to separate from the pack increases.</p>, <p>Biden used a written statement issued by a spokesperson as his only public comment Wednesday. For a candidate already under fire for a lackadaisical campaign schedule, that position is untenable. It’s 2019 and voters consume their news through video, not writing. Expect Biden to be pressed to go further on the campaign hustings and especially at Miami’s debate.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>While Pelosi’s hold on her caucus has been impressive, it could crumble quickly. The list of her pro-impeachment members stands close to 40. That number could jump any moment, especially if one of the more vocal members of the media-savvy freshman class decides to light a match. Many members of the new Congress made promises to take down Trump. If they decide it’s time to fulfill that pledge, Pelosi’s headaches will grow.</p>, <p>The temperature has been rising in Washington this week, both literally and politically. Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden can’t prevent the summer humidity from setting in, but they are keeping a check on the heat around impeachment – at least for now.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/r/colin-reed"" target=""_blank"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM COLIN REED</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

Instead, he fell back on the convoluted language in his report, hoping to obfuscate an issue that Attorney General William Barr had previously clarified by determining that the special counsel’s investigation did not produce sufficient evidence to justify charging President Trump with obstructing justice.</p>, <p>“If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller told reporters, explaining that, as part of the Justice Department, his office was “bound by” the OLC’s opinion.</p>, <p>“Charging the president with a crime was, therefore, not an option we could consider,” Mueller said.</p>, <p>That’s a fantasy Mueller just tried to sell on national TV. Here’s the reality.</p>, <p>If President Trump actually committed a crime, there is nothing in the OLC’s opinion that would have prevented the special counsel or the attorney general from saying so.</p>, <p>The most relevant concern the OLC raises is that an indictment “exposes the President to an official pronouncement that there is probable cause to believe he committed a criminal act,” which could impair “his credibility in carrying out his constitutional responsibilities.”</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">The motive is obvious. Mueller, having failed for two years to find Trump-Russia “collusion,” is trying to reframe the Russiagate narrative in an effort to put some wind back in the sails of the impeachment effort.</p>, <p>A special counsel’s private report to the attorney general ran no such risk, especially since Barr was under no legal obligation to make Mueller’s report public. Special counsels don’t issue indictments – grand juries do.</p>, <p>That’s why the last man with responsibilities similar to Mueller’s – Independent Counsel Ken Starr – had no qualms writing definitively about findings of criminal wrongdoing by the subject of his investigation, President Bill Clinton.</p>, <p>“The Office of Independent Counsel (OIC) hereby submits substantial and credible information that President /Clinton obstructed justice … the President lied under oath to the grand jury and obstructed justice,” Starr wrote, along with dozens of other unambiguous determinations that President Clinton had committed crimes.</p>, <p>The idea that the OLC somehow stopped Mueller from doing the same thing is absurd.</p>, <p>If Mueller thought there was probable cause to charge President Trump with obstruction of justice – or any other crime – he could have said so in his report without any repercussions.</p>, <p>Because Mueller’s report was a private, internal Justice Department document intended for the attorney general, Mueller could draw any conclusion he wanted regarding President Trump without violating Justice Department policy against disclosing derogatory uncharged conduct.</p>, <p>If, on the other hand, Mueller believed that the evidence was not sufficient to establish a chargeable case of obstruction of justice, he could have said so just as easily. He did, in fact, do exactly that with dozens of other potential crimes over the course of his report, including the one that served as the basis for his entire investigation.</p>, <p>Most crucially, Mueller’s own report admitted that the Special Counsel’s Office  “did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”</p>, <p>Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had the courage and integrity to do what Mueller would not. Reviewing the same underlying material that Mueller developed, and in consultation with other senior Justice Department attorneys, Barr and Rosenstein jointly concluded that the evidence was “not sufficient” to constitute obstruction of justice by President Trump. Period.</p>, <p>More importantly, Barr went out of his way to dispel any notion that his determination had anything to do with the OLC’s opinion.</p>, <p>“Our determination was made without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president,” Barr said.</p>, <p>The entire idea that President Trump’s vindication rested solely on the OLC opinion should have died the day Barr released his preliminary summary of the Mueller report’s conclusions.</p>, <p>Unfortunately, Mueller has created new shades of gray for the Democrats to exploit and chose this politically opportune moment to do so, as the Russiagaters flail on Capitol Hill.</p>, <p>The motive is obvious. Mueller, having failed for two years to find Trump-Russia “collusion,” is trying to reframe the Russiagate narrative in an effort to put some wind back in the sails of the impeachment effort.</p>, <p>Mueller couldn’t even stop himself from dropping a not-so-subtle hint to that effect when he spoke to reporters and the TV audience, characterizing the OLC’s opinion as saying that “the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.”</p>, <p>Undoubtedly, those making a show out of trying to impeach President Trump over the next year will hang on these words and adopt Mueller’s narrative – even though it’s a far cry from the “collusion” hoax that spawned this whole sorry saga.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"">CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></strong></p>, <p>If that wasn’t Mueller’s intention all along, it certainly has been ever since he must have realized that his whole investigation was nothing more than a witch hunt.</p>, <p>The case was made and is now closed, but that didn’t stop Mueller from taking one last shot at President Trump that will ultimately change nothing about the conclusions Mueller made in his own report.</p>, <p><strong><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/person/d/joseph-digenova"">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JOE DIGENOVA</a></strong></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.

The only way to ensure that is to begin impeachment proceedings.""</p>, <p><a href=""https://video.foxnews.com/playlist/longform-tucker-carlson-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE ENTIRE EPISODE.</strong></a></p>, <p>And then from their seats on cable news sets across New York City, America's opinion generating class applauded heartily:</p>, <p><em>Ari Melber, MSNBC host: This was vintage Bob Mueller, no questions, no bull.</em></p>, <p><em>Frank Figliuzzi, MSNBC national security analyst: He speaks in measured, but clear tones and style. </em></p>, <p><em>Glenn Kirschner, former federal prosecutor: That's the man Bob Mueller is. He is precise. He is factual. He is accurate. The man doesn't know the definition of hyperbole. </em></p>, <p><em>Chris Matthews, MSNBC host: I think a lot of us have been very supportive of Mueller and what he's done. He has worked very hard and done a really good job. </em></p>, <p>Man, can they suck up when they want to! A man never stands so tall when he stoops to kiss a butt. That's their motto. It's unbelievable.</p>, <p class=""quote-text"">When Robert Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>But you may be slightly confused, listening to all this. Democrats are demanding impeachment, and the press strongly agrees with that. They love Robert Mueller. But what will the crime be, exactly? What would the charges be in an impeachment proceeding? Would it be Russian collusion, the core charge?</p>, <p><a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products"" target=""_blank""><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.</strong></a></p>, <p>Well, as Mueller himself conceded, there's no evidence that ever happened.</p>, <p>""The first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from Russia to influence the election,"" he said during his public statement. ""This volume includes a discussion of the Trump campaign's response to this activity, as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy.""</p>, <p>""Insufficient evidence."" In other words, there was no crime. That's how it works. The same is true for obstruction, by Mueller's own admission. After two years, he and his subordinates were unable to find a criminal act.</p>, <p>""The report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president,"" Mueller said. ""If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.""</p>, <p>""Under longstanding department policy, a present president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office,"" Mueller added. ""That is unconstitutional. The Special Counsel's Office is part of the Department of Justice and by regulation, it was bound by that department policy. Charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider.""</p>, <p>Yes, got that. We knew that, in fact.</p>, <p>And just to be clear, prosecutors in civilized countries don't prove people innocent. They don't need to do that. That's the standing presumption that all of us have by virtue of our citizenship. Instead, prosecutors look for evidence of guilt, and if there is no evidence of guilt, a person is declared not guilty. That's how our system works.</p>, <p>So when Mueller said he couldn't prove the president didn't commit a crime, it was an odd and striking and honestly kind of a bizarre thing to say. The bottom line is that the evidence Mueller gathered did not support charges of collusion or obstruction of justice.</p>, <p>Yet, Mueller would clearly like to see the president impeached anyway. Democrats are likely to take him up on that.</p>, <p><em>Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on May 29, 2019.</em></p>, <p class=""copyright"">This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2019 FOX News Network, LLC.
