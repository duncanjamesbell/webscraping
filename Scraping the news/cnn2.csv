Birmingham and Selma have become synonymous with the expansion of civil rights they helped forge; that history is in eternal tension with the drive to shrink this progress back to the oligarchic dark ages of the 1901 state constitution.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Huntsvillians used to lament that the state line wasn't drawn some 20 miles south at the Tennessee River, but now they elect politicians very much in step with Alabama values. In March, their congressman, Mo Brooks, read from <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/26/gop-congressman-quotes-hitlers-mein-kampf-slam-trumps-adversaries-liars/?utm_term=.1157b4c8929c"" target=""_blank"">""Mein Kampf"" on the House floor</a> (to be fair, he was comparing Democrats to Hitler) the same week that local scholars were hosting a symposium on NASA in the South. And the area's two state senators, one a former Democrat, were among the 25 white Republican men who made abortion a crime this week, with no exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">To read the names and places of those 25 white men is to enter some alt-right Disneyland of American history. There is Steve Livingston of Scottsboro, namesake town of the nine black ""Scottsboro Boys,"" who earned international fame as victims of judicial lynching after being falsely accused of rape by two white women (from Huntsville). There's the state senate's President Pro Tem Del Marsh of Anniston, scene of the <a href=""https://www.nps.gov/frri/planyourvisit/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">1961 Klan firebombing</a> of the Freedom Riders; 50 years later he made civil rights history himself as a cheerleader for the 2011 anti-immigrant law that recast <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/no-sweet-home-alabama.html"" target=""_blank"">Jim Crow as Juan Crow</a>.

But given that the majority of <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/who-is-most-affected-by-alabamas-new-abortion-ban.html"" target=""_blank"">pregnancies terminated in Alabama</a> are by women of color, it may seem counterintuitive that today's Constitution-defying legislators are so keen on protecting the ""rights"" of future human life that will very likely be dehumanized by the civil society those same white men created: substandard schools from which children are pipelined to <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/judge-rules-alabama-prisons-fail-to-adequately-prevent-suicides.html"" target=""_blank"">suicide-inducing prisons</a>; <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2017/12/un_poverty_official_touring_al.html"" target=""_blank"">sewage-plagued communities</a> shocking to UN poverty specialists and only miles from Selma, starting place of the famous 1965 march pivotal to the passage Voting Rights Act, which was <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/shelby-county-v-holder"" target=""_blank"">undermined in 2013</a> by a landmark Supreme Court decision upholding a challenge out of Alabama.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the yin and yang of Alabama, ""civil rights"" are its biggest curse and its greatest gift. In 2018, the state saw its biggest increase in tourism ever, according to Alabama's tourism director Lee Sentell.

Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin confirmed to me today that the abortion ban affected two IT companies considering moves to the city -- one canceled outright, while the other ""put the brakes on negotiations.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But boycotts in response to this abortion law are more likely to punish the state's brave, embattled progressives than shame those who are without shame.<a href=""http://repdaniels.com/representative-anthony-daniels/"" target=""_blank""> Anthony Daniels</a> (D-Huntsville), the educator-turned-House minority leader who led the walkout of Democratic legislators in protest of the abortion-crime bill, proposes a constructive alternative.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're the guinea pigs for bad pieces of legislation,"" he told me of his Republican-super-majority state.

It was Daniels who introduced the ""rape and incest"" amendment that made the ban's supporters cast a hard vote to force women to bear the children of rapists and/or relatives. And by spotlighting that bill's <a href=""https://www.al.com/news/2019/05/alabama-abortion-ban-was-deeply-unpopular-in-2018-previously-unreleased-polling-shows.html"" target=""_blank"">unpopular extremes</a> -- including the 99-year sentences for abortion doctors -- rather than getting into the merits of the abortion debate, he was able both ""to divide their base and to satisfy our base by giving them something to grab hold of.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Even if the ""Alabama Human Life Protection Act"" doesn't end up being <a href=""https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/5/15/18624810/alabama-abortion-ban-supreme-court-exceptions-senate"" target=""_blank"">the test case</a> that gets the Supreme Court to rule up or down on Roe, Alabama has lived up to its legacy by forcing a stark moral reckoning. Just as the <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx"" target=""_blank"">widely accepted ""rape and incest""</a> exception shows that abortion is not always murder in the eyes of its opponents, so does the <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/15/alabama-abortion-law-american-views-abortion-poll-pro-life-pro-choice-republicans-catholic-heartbeat/3678315002/"" target=""_blank"">latest polling suggest</a> that supporters do not take an absolutist either/or position.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Perhaps proponents could concede that there is a moral argument against abortion. For one thing, there just is. And for another, acknowledging someone's aggrievement is a proven conflict de-escalator, as when<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628492/"" target=""_blank""> doctors apologize to victims</a> for medical errors and are consequently less likely to be hit with malpractice suits. And only from the safe distance of high ground, one might then be able to point out that ""being pro-birth is not the same as being pro-life,"" as Daniels puts it, or consistent with being pro-death penalty and against birth control access, Medicaid, children's insurance and the rest of Alabama conservatives' pet peeves.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every liberal here knows that the game is a long one. Back in 1976, the legendary liberal federal judge Frank Johnson -- a Republican -- took <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/us/us-relinquishes-alabama-prisons.html"" target=""_blank"">receivership of the state's prison system</a>, writing that it beggared ""any current judicial definition of cruel and usual punishment.""

""The worst symptoms obviously were hallucinations. And I wasn't always oriented to time and place.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Once, Palma locked herself out of her own house and another time, her bank account.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was no longer able to process the fact that a key opens the door. The computer screen looked completely different -- it was almost foreign,"" said the now-42 year old. ""What I was perceiving was different and so how I was responding was different -- if someone was asking for a pen, I would give them, for example, a key.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Sometimes she had blissful, symptom-free days. With no warning, the dropping things, the hallucinations, the disorientation would return. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Brain lesion discovered on a scan </h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After January, her symptoms ""progressed pretty quickly,"" she said, guesstimating she visited the emergency room at least 10 times. ""But as soon as they ruled out a brain bleed, I was discharged. Although I was a danger to myself and probably to others, they still discharged me,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She understands why, since no one could identify what was happening with her. ""They said, 'If you're not actually having a brain bleed, then it's not actually an emergency,' "" she said.  A seizure disorder was also investigated and quickly dismissed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On a brain scan, Palma's primary care physician detected a small lesion in the left frontal lobe of her brain and immediately sent her to <a href=""https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jonathan-j-rasouli"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Jonathan Rasouli, </a>chief resident of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, and his colleagues.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We decided it would probably be in her best interest to do a biopsy of this lesion,"" said Rasouli based on the fact that she was healthy and young and was having symptoms that he could directly correlate to the location of the lesion. Besides, she had no risk factors for anything else that might explain the presence of a brain lesion. Rasouli carefully explained the possibilities to his patient.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was told that it was most likely a malignant tumor which would require radiation and chemo even after the surgery,"" said Palma. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The surgery would be risky because the location of her ""tumor"" was very close to the brain region that controls speech.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli told CNN, ""Her fiancé had just proposed to her and they were looking to move in together and then all of a sudden she had this diagnosis of a brain tumor. Can you imagine?"" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palma, though, believed the risk was worth it, ""given that it was supposed to be a malignant tumor. I still think the risk was worth it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her first operation, essentially a ""planning surgery,"" explained Rasouli, took place on September 2, 2018. A second surgery to remove the suspected tumor followed on September 12. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We did a small dissection of the brain tissue and what we saw was a very well encapsulated, firm lesion that was ovoid,"" said Rasouli. ""It looked like a quail egg: Same size, same look, same firmness.""<strong> </strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Wait a second, this is clearly not a brain tumor,"" he recalled saying at the time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked what a brain tumor looks like, he laughed: ""It doesn't look like a quail egg. Most brain tumors are very soft, very mushy, they're not very well defined, they're infiltrative and it's difficult to get completely around them.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Quickly, Rasouli took the extracted lesion away from the surgical field, placed it under a surgical microscope and opened it up.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""And what came out was a baby tapeworm,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How did it get there?</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cysticercosis/disease.html"" target=""_blank"">Neurocysticercosis </a>is the medical term for when a baby pork tapeworm makes its way to the brain, said Rasouli. ""If you live in the US, it's almost impossible to get this.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those most at risk are those who travel to countries where this pork tapeworm is endemic and eat contaminated food -- usually raw fruits, raw vegetables or uncooked pork. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli said that the tapeworm found in her brain ""is not super-duper rare, it's just pretty uncommon. Maybe once every two years you'd see something like this, if even that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's absolutely no explanation as to how I contracted it,"" said Palma. She's never traveled outside the country and she doesn't eat raw foods or raw meat, at least not intentionally, she said. How long it had been lodged in her brain is another mystery, she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're still really scratching our heads about how she developed this,"" said Rasouli. ""If we had any suspicion that she could have been exposed to pork tapeworm or we thought this was potentially a parasite, we ideally would have treated her with antibiotics rather than taking her into surgery.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, Palma has no symptoms and is feeling fine. She's thankful to Rasouli and the medical staff at Mount Sinai for saving her life. If the tapeworm hadn't been removed (or destroyed with antibiotics), it could have caused a stroke or even death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With all the attention -- ""for some reason my story is fascinating to people"" -- Palma now has an important message to deliver: ""This is not something that is cause for widespread panic. What happened to me is extremely rare -- it's not the norm -- for someone who has not been overseas to contract this.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With a lot of people coming to her for medical advice, she gives the only advice she can: ""If you have symptoms that you cannot explain or are concerning to you, then please see a doctor. And see a good doctor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Not every headache turns out to be a parasite.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

They fear the regulatory uncertainty that could come from years of litigation, especially if it resulted in two different sets of emission rules for different parts of the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The question of the right level of regulation is complex,"" the industry said in the letter to Trump. ""What works best for consumers, communities, and the millions of US employees that work in the auto industry is one national standard that is practical, achievable, and consistent across the 50 states."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The letter said the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation would be as ""untenable"" as the tougher rules. The automakers also said they need regulatory certainty in order to make needed investment in the next generation of vehicles.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But California has fought to keep the tougher rules in place for itself and 12 other states that follow its lead. Those 13 states include about a third of the nation's population.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">California and the federal government are already fighting in court over the emissions rules and whether or not California will be able to maintain the tougher standards.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The automakers also sent a letter to California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday asking for a compromise with federal regulators. That letter said the automakers believe the best deal would be one that ""includes annual reductions in greenhouse gas emissions midway between the existing standards and the preferred path outlined in the recent Environmental Protection Agency proposal."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">California has so far shown no interest in backing off its tougher standards. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""A rollback of auto emissions standards is bad for the climate and bad for the economy,"" Newsom said in a statement about the industry's two letters. ""We should keep working towards one national standard -- one that doesn't backtrack on the progress states like California have made. California will continue to lead the coalition to block these rule changes from taking effect.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">White House spokesman Judd Deere said the blame for the lack of a single national standard rests not with the federal government but with California's refusal to negotiate with Trump administration to reach a compromise.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Deere also said the California Air Resources Board, the environmental regulator there, ""failed to put forward a productive alternative, and we are moving forward to finalize a rule with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner, and more affordable vehicles.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Obama rules would have required automakers to produce vehicles with an average fuel economy to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2011/07/28/autos/fuel_economy/index.htm"" target=""_blank"">54.5 miles per gallon</a> by 2025 model year vehicles. The rules in place at that time would have only required an average of 34.1 mpg by that time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration moved to <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2017/03/15/autos/relaxed-mpg-standards-consumer-impact/index.html"" target=""_blank"">reexamine</a> those tougher rules shortly after taking office.

An ""elliptical cluster"" of seismic activity had formed around the volcano, they determined, with seismic events taking place more than three miles beneath the surface. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""These seismic properties may indicate the presence of magma intrusions with a high content of [...] fluids, which may justify changing the current status of this volcano from 'extinct' to 'active,'"" the researchers wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moreover, they observed that the cluster of seismic events connected the volcano with the Tolud zone, to the south of the volcano, a region believed to store magma in the Earth's lower crust. The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said. Ash released by the eruption could spread beyond Russia, disrupting air travel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unfortunately, the volcano is difficult to monitor, thanks to its distance from permanent seismic stations, Koulakov said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We need to deploy more stations to understand if it's dangerous or not,"" he said.

I was married to my best friend and we had two beautiful, healthy and hilarious children, with successful careers and a beautiful home.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">My life would change forever after a simple Google search in November 2016. I had just seen Kate McKinnon perform the song ""Hallelujah"" on SNL and discovered that she's a lesbian. That shocked me because she didn't fit the awful stereotype often depicted in the media. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I quickly declared her my ""new girl crush."" But it was more than that. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At that moment, I realized that I wanted a relationship with a woman like her -- but I felt terrible for even having this thought, as someone who was faithfully married. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was slowly becoming clear to me that I was not straight. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How could I not know? I had my first ""boyfriend"" in the 3rd grade. I had already decided I was straight. How do you go back on that after being with guys for 20+ years? </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Where I fell on the sexuality spectrum would take me the better part of two years to figure out. A part of myself wasn't living. And by not letting that part live, I was slowly dying. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Unraveling a life</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There's a price of admission for coming out as gay later in life. Over the course of several months, I paid the price daily. It was like I was watching a movie about myself but unable to control what was unfolding. Everything fell apart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I did my best to slowly confide in my husband. But I kept many of my feelings inside to avoid hurting him. He tried to be supportive, but he also needed answers. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He felt unsettled and scared about the uncertainty of our future. He asked several times if I was a lesbian. It was a question that felt impossible to answer because I knew what that answer would mean. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I kept waiting for the moment where I would realize I was no longer gay so I could put a halt to everything. My family was being shattered and I couldn't stop it. I constantly had to remind myself, <em>""You get one life. This is your life and no one else's.""  </em></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I felt alone. I was crumbling and desperately looking for someone who could relate. I Googled to the ends of the earth looking for stories like mine. They were few and far between -- and none seemed to touch on just how difficult the journey ahead of me could be.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">By early 2018, my husband and I separated in an effort to give me some perspective. I lost time with my children as we began a shared custody schedule. I was consumed by the pit in my stomach --  the shame of ending my marriage because I was gay was like lugging a sandbag over my shoulders and having a rock in my stomach at the same time. I couldn't eat. My weight dropped by the day. For the first time since I met my husband, we went a full day without speaking. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I wasn't sure how to tell my conservative, Georgia-born and bred parents that their former pageant queen daughter was ending her marriage because she is gay. I'm very close with my parents -- a phone call with my mom is almost a daily occurrence. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I confided in my sister first. I wasn't brave enough to actually say the words -- the label of being gay or a lesbian was too much for my soul to bear at the time -- so I sent her a text message, ""I am not straight."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She responded perfectly, asking if she could buy a Pride flag and offered to tell my parents. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Later that day, I got two of the most relieving texts from my parents that I've ever received. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I didn't realize until then how important it was to be accepted by my parents. I'm a grown woman, fully independent of my mom and dad -- but I still needed their love and acceptance. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Living my truth</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Telling my family wasn't the end of my journey. I was finally figuring out who I was. Now I was ashamed by that answer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That began to subside when I met other women in various stages of the coming out process, all on the same path. Hearing the experience of others felt like hearing my own: married to wonderful men, mothers of amazing kids, the perfect life practically every woman strives for. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through this group, led by a therapist, we quickly determined we are in this together. We were on a path that feels impossible to navigate until one day, you can live your truth and be perfectly fine shaping a new life. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That's what I'm striving to do now: shape a new life that includes my now ex-husband and my kids. Our family structure just looks a little different than it used to. We spend most holidays together, attend parent-teacher conferences, we even have plans to take the kids to Disney World in the fall. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We no longer have the perfect suburban home together, but we are both navigating new relationships and have found people who understand the importance of us both being present for our children. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On New Year's Day this year, I came out on social media. I expected to see my friend list tick down but instead I was met by love and support. So many people choose to keep their private lives private, which I absolutely understand and respect. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But what so many don't realize is that sharing your tough moments can make other people's tough moments a little easier.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">I don't think I would have been able to accept who I am as quickly as I did without the changes in American society in recent years. When I was growing up in the 1980s, someone's sexuality was only spoken about in hushed voices, as if the person had a disease they didn't want others to know about. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg -- who, like me, is in his late 30s and, like me, came out publicly just a few years ago -- <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kind-war-buttigieg-describes-struggle-sexual-orientation-emotional-speech-n991871"" target=""_blank"">put it this way</a>: ""It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would've swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is so much truth in his statement. There was such a big part of me that did not want to be gay. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a gay person over the age of 30 who hasn't felt this way. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On the flip side, it is getting better for younger generations. When I told my kids last year that if mom remarries, it will be to a woman -- it didn't faze them in the least.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Throughout all of this, I would have loved to have known that I was going to come out on the other side and be OK. And I want people reading my story to know that it's OK to be the person you're meant to be -- no matter what your age is when you finally get to know yourself and love who you are in the process. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Speaking to the <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/06e0242a-681d-11e9-b809-6f0d2f5705f6"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times</a> about a decision not to collaborate with Supreme, Birkenstock's chief sales officer, Klaus Baumann, pointed out the reality of creating the appearance of demand: ""If I put a bouncer outside our doors on Saturday and regulate letting people in, I too could have a queue outside."" </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">But it's not just about getting people to queue. There's the art of getting people excited about the experience. Like Supreme's loyal consumers, today's Yeezy buyers weren't put out to be standing outside on a rainy London morning. In fact, I'd bet there were probably fewer sighs, groans and eye rolls in these queues than any other in Britain. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">And it all tracks back to that culture of exclusivity. The level of anticipation isn't just about buying the shoes, but also about being one of the few people who gets to buy these shoes first. There's the thrill of ownership where others are forced to concede defeat; the aggregation of clout through consumerism. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">On top of that, streetwear sites like Hypebeast (where I formerly served as UK editor) and Highsnobiety, whose monthly user base is in the tens of millions often send professional photographers to shoot the scene. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">In this sense, it's not just about securing the prize. It's about the act of being there and, perhaps more importantly, being seen to be there and letting your peers now that you got what they couldn't. </div>, <div class=""Paragraph__component BasicArticle__paragraph BasicArticle__pad"">Whether they're ever worn or not, whether they're immediately resold to the highest bidder for a huge profit, you were there because you were part of something important, an event within the culture, and that's the prize no one can sell on. </div>]"

For men, it's 59.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most common type of anal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, originates in the cells lining the anal canal, according to the US National Library of Medicine. Typically, anal cancer spreads slowly and, if caught early, is often curable.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Nationally, there are more than <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/race.htm"" target=""_blank"">6,500</a> new HPV-associated anal cancer diagnoses each year -- including about 4,300 in women and 2,200 in men, according to one agency estimate based on data from 2011 to 2015. That comes out to roughly a couple of cases for every 100,000 people.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>About the virus</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There are 150 types of HPV, but most are rare and only 14 are considered high-risk for cancer. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Most people -- about nine in 10 -- will get an HPV infection at some point in their lives,"" the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">says</a>. It's the most common sexually transmitted infection in the country, can be spread even when someone has no symptoms, and may result in symptoms years after being exposed to the virus.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">HPV infections mostly go away on their own, but some remain and can cause cervix, vagina and vulva cancer in women; penile cancer in men; and genital warts, anal cancer and head and neck cancers in both sexes. HPV-associated cancers are more likely to occur in the throat and cervix than the anus. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Other risk factors for anal cancer include HIV, smoking, and any medications or conditions that might weaken the immune system.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The most likely type of HPV implicated in anal cancer is <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805865/#bib1"" target=""_blank"">HPV 16</a>, which is covered by current vaccination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Current CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">recommendations</a> call for HPV vaccination for boys and girls to begin between the ages of 11 and 12, though the regimen can occur as early as age 9. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>When it comes to screening, the jury's out</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the HPV vaccine and routine screening have made cervical cancer ""one of the most preventable cancers,"" as the CDC <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html"" target=""_blank"">says</a>, the jury's still out on who should be screened for anal cancer, when and how.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Anal cancers are sometimes found through rectal exams -- part of a routine pelvic exam by a gynecologist, in Cross' case. These cancers may cause symptoms like pain or bleeding, but they often don't in earlier stages.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was so not thinking anything was wrong because I didn't have any symptoms, and she gave me an exam and came around and said, 'Well, I just want you to know, whatever it is, it's curable,' "" Cross said. ""It was like 'What? What are you talking about?' ""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The American Cancer Society says that certain groups at higher risk -- like recipients of an organ transplant and men who have sex with men -- might benefit from a screening measure like the ""anal pap,"" which looks for precancerous cellular changes when the anus is swabbed.

Chris Stewart was sitting in church in Atlanta on an April Sunday in 2015 when he received a Facebook message with a news article and a plea from a friend. A police officer had killed her cousin, Walter Scott, and she needed help.</p>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Later that day, his phone rang in the middle of an engagement photo shoot with his fiancée. This time it was Walter Scott's brother.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">""They're lying about my brother,"" Stewart recalled him saying. ""If you can get here by tomorrow, you're hired."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart, 40, is among a growing group of prominent civil rights attorneys in the country who have become the go-to for families of black men who have been killed by police. They are confidants and counselors, helping their clients navigate not just their cases, but the media and the public during one of the worst times of their lives.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Generations ago, civil rights attorneys fought against segregation, and to secure rights denied to African Americans, Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The current battle is staying alive to use those rights,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart did take the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/08/us/south-carolina-who-was-walter-scott/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Walter Scott</a> case, and would end up using a tactic that turned Scott's death into a national rallying cry against excessive force by police. Before Stewart, there was Benjamin Crump, who helped tell the world about <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2012/05/18/justice/florida-teen-shooting-details/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trayvon Martin</a>, a teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Florida, and S. Lee Merritt, who helped bring attention to the death of <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/us/jordan-edwards-shooting-trnd/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Jordan Edwards</a>, a teenager shot and killed by a suburban Dallas police officer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a series of interviews, the attorneys spoke to CNN about their work, their motivations, and their goals.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The lawyers practice in an age where cell phone and body cameras have captured fatal encounters with police. Their tactics are strategic and media-savvy. Their goal is to hold abusive officers accountable and force systemic changes in policing in this country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When you hear us advocate, we're not advocating for a settlement, we're advocating for an indictment,"" Merritt said. ""We're advocating for a conviction.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The video that changed the narrative</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart arrived at the Scott family home in North Charleston, South Carolina, in the middle of the night, the day after Walter Scott was shot dead. He carried only a duffel bag and two suits, thinking he wouldn't be there for long.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart didn't go home for two months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They started having to FedEx me suits and clothes,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As an attorney, Stewart had mostly handled sexual assault cases in his career. In 2014 he took on the case of Gregory Towns, who died in police custody after two East Point, Georgia, officers used a stun gun on him while he was handcuffed. Both officers were convicted, including one for murder, <a href=""https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/south-fulton-county/former-east-point-officer-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-mans-taser-murder/477823504"" target=""_blank"">according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV</a>. The family and city also settled a lawsuit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walter Scott's family had heard about that case -- and so they reached out to Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family was not convinced that the police account of what happened to Scott was accurate. Police said at the time that an officer pulled Scott over for a broken tail light and a foot chase followed. The officer said he used a stun gun on Scott; Scott tried to take that weapon and the officer shot him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We knew my brother and what he was about,"" Anthony Scott told CNN. ""He was never the type of guy that would fight a cop.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family would later learn that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/09/us/south-carolina-witness-video/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Feidin Santana</a>, a bystander, had recorded Walter Scott's last moments.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana had sent a screenshot of the footage to a Black Lives Matter activist, who told Scott's family about it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana went to the home of another one of Walter Scott's brothers to meet Stewart and his co-counsel, Justin Bamberg. But Santana didn't want to stay there; he was scared for his life. They drove around and finally settled on a secluded parking lot, Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It took Stewart and Bamberg several hours to convince Santana to show them the video and give it to them. It showed North Charleston police officer Michael Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away. ""This can't be real,"" Stewart remembered thinking when he saw the video. ""A police officer wouldn't just unload on somebody like that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late that night, the lawyers turned the video over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The state agency released it to the public days after Scott was killed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The video changed the narrative of the shooting and sparked outrage across the country. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Slager was charged with murder and fired. Stewart also helped to secure a $6.5 million settlement for the Scott family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Slager's murder trial ended in <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/michael-slager-murder-trial-walter-scott-mistrial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a hung jury</a> in December 2016. Everyone lost hope, but ""we just never gave up on it and kept pushing,"" Stewart said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A year later, Slager was <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentenced to 20 years</a> in a federal prison after he pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Filled with gratitude, Stewart and Scott's family gathered in a back room in the courthouse with the lead prosecutor after the sentencing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They held hands in a circle and prayed. Stewart asked Scott's mother, Judy, to speak to the media.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Facing reporters, she held a framed photo of her son against her chest as the nation watched. Stewart spoke first.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He called it ""a historic day for civil rights, particularly in officer-involved shootings."" Stewart wanted to convey the magnitude of such a sentence for a police officer. It was the ""best of inadequate justice"" that civil rights cases get, he said recalling that moment. ""This is all people crave, is accountability.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Nine out of 10 times, the families don't get justice, the community doesn't observe justice and it's just written off,"" Stewart said. ""And it just goes away, then it's just kind of a lasting open wound."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The work takes its toll</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In April 2017, Roy Oliver, then an officer in Balch Springs, Texas, opened fire on a car full of teenagers as they drove past him leaving a party. Police claimed they had heard gunshots outside the house; Oliver said he thought the car was moving aggressively toward his partner.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A bullet struck 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, a passenger in the car, in the head, killing him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Details of the killing seep into attorney Merritt's dreams, giving him nightmares -- like the way Jordan's brothers described him getting shot, smoke rising from Jordan's forehead.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Instead of it being Jordan, it's my 9-year-old,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Civil rights law is not an easy field, the attorneys say. Cases take years to settle. The work is disruptive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt has struggled with depression. Online trolls forced Stewart to hire private security at his house during the Scott case, and again when he represented the family of Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black father who was shot dead by one of two white officers who confronted him outside a Louisiana convenience store in 2016. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump, 49, has received threatening phone calls and letters over the years.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">L. Chris Stewart, S. Lee Merritt and Benjamin Crump have bonded since serving on a panel at a National Bar Association conference over the summer. They talk often in a group text that includes other civil rights lawyers. The conversation is wide-ranging, jumping from legal strategy to college football to holiday greetings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What everybody respects about each other is that somebody's stepping up doing this, because there are just not a lot of people that will take a civil rights case,"" Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police-involved shootings <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/us/police-deadly-force-trials/index.html"" target=""_blank"">rarely end in convictions</a>. Jurors and the broader public often give police officers the benefit of the doubt, and there is often a high burden of proof. The federal statute used to evaluate police shootings, for example, requires a finding that the officer willfully or intentionally sought to kill someone. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Approaching new cases, the attorneys' first step is to make sure enough evidence is available and that public pressure is strong enough for charges to be brought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Jordan's case, Merritt took affidavits from witnesses and directed them to the district attorney's office. A Dallas County grand jury indicted Oliver for murder about three months after the fatal shooting, and his case went to trial. After hours of deliberations, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/us/texas-officer-convicted-jordan-edwards-death/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a jury convicted him</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also had success with this strategy when he took on the case of Botham Jean. Amber Guyger, an off-duty Dallas police officer, fired two shots at Jean after she says she mistakenly entered his apartment at a complex where she also lived.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt's office obtained an affidavit from a witness who said they heard knocking on Jean's door shortly before Guyger, who lived directly above Jean, entered his apartment and killed him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also called for Guyger to be fired and charged.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Guyger was indicted for murder on December 1. Her trial is set for September 23, according to <a href=""https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/04/03/trial-dallas-officer-amber-guyger-botham-jean/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate KTVT</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The roots of their strategy</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham Jean's mother, Allison, had traveled to the United States many times, but she wasn't familiar with the justice system at the time of her son's death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham's aunt, who lives in Florida, reached out to Crump. Allison Jean remembered him from his work representing Trayvon Martin's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A Texas state senator recommended Merritt, but Jean still wasn't sure. She asked a friend who was an attorney in St. Lucia to research Merritt. ""Given what had happened to my son, I was looking at everybody with much apprehension,"" said Jean, a former government official in St. Lucia.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But she quickly grew comfortable with Merritt, Crump and Daryl Washington, a Texas attorney. The three men spent up to 12 hours a day with her during her first week in Dallas, holding her hand at times, she said. Crump often checked to see if she had eaten.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They met me at the hotel. They came to ... the memorial service,"" she said. ""They met me at the (district attorney's office). We just spent the entire day together, for an entire week. They never left my side,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt kept the Jeans<strong> </strong>company one night after a Dallas County grand jury failed to indict Guyger in its first day of deliberation. He passed the time playing dominoes with Allison Jean's husband.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""That helped to quell my anxiety,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Getting to know the family and their loved one is a crucial part of representing these cases, Crump said. Crump has encouraged his clients to talk publicly about their loved ones to reshape the public narrative about them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We have never met these young people of color, who've been killed by the police, in life,"" Crump said. ""We only meet them in death. And we have to then bring them back to life in the media.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump encourages the families to help the world know the person they knew, and not just the person described in a police report or shown in a grainy viral video.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are always going to be more effective in telling who Botham Jean was,"" he told Jean's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because their legal strategy is often tied to media interviews and press conferences, some criticize the attorneys for sowing division -- trying to grab headlines rather than finding common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Charley Wilkison, executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, a police union, said police are often criticized and second-guessed, but they have the fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the criminal justice system does deserve criticism, he said, it's still important to find common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""While we're preaching tolerance in the country, it kind of behooves all of us to find a middle, that's just very unpopular right now in this country,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The tolerance that they're calling for is not being practiced,"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In response, Merritt said that ""when I or other attorneys call out law enforcement for the extremely hazardous, deadly culture that is unique in the world, it's because it's really bad.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't know that they get that,"" he said. ""The black community gets it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How civil rights became their calling</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt, 36, rose to prominence after he represented Mark Hughes, the man Dallas police incorrectly identified as a suspect in the fatal shooting of five officers in a July 2016 protest against police-involved shootings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt said he started a campaign ""to clear him in the eyes of the public.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned much of this legal strategy from Johnnie Cochran, the lead attorney defending O.J. Simpson when he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. ""Cochran used to play his cases out in the media, use the media to create political pressure,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump credited Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall as his inspiration to practice law. In elementary school, Crump was bused to a new predominantly white school in Lumberton, North Carolina. His mother worked at a factory and a hotel for little pay.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned from his mother and teachers that he could attend the school because Marshall, then an attorney for the NAACP, argued Brown v. Board of Education before the US Supreme Court, leading to the desegregation of public schools.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to be like Thurgood Marshall because I want to make it good for people who live in my community and people who look like me,"" Crump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His respect for Marshall even influences how he decides which cases to take. A case must ""shock my conscience,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart's conscience was shocked by the injustice he saw in a small Florida town more than a decade ago. The Tulane University graduate, who studied public health, found himself angry as he sat in a room in Florida with an attorney and residents who believed they were sick with cancer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the time, Stewart worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, monitoring cancer clusters in low-income communities. Stewart heard the lawyers for the company that owned a chemical plant near a water source -- the suspected cause of the cancer -- laughing about golf in another room. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That flippant attitude angered Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> ""If I see something wrong and I think I can do something about it, then I do something about it,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Lesser-known figures on the front lines</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For every one of these attorneys in the national spotlight, there are many others addressing civil rights issues around the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before Michele K. Rayner-Goolsby was born, her parents were among some of the first black students to enroll at the University of South Florida in the 1960s. Her parents taught her to help others and lift her community up as she advanced. She recalled watching her mom, who was a social worker, give a bag of groceries to a homeless client they found standing in front of a grocery store.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby hadn't planned to focus on civil rights cases, but during an internship with a public defenders' office in Florida she began to encounter clients who alleged their rights were violated.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, the 37-year-old attorney represents the family of Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot last summer during an altercation over a parking space at a convenience store in Clearwater, Florida, her hometown. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri initially said he wouldn't arrest Michael Drejka, the man who shot McGlockton, citing the state's ""stand your ground"" law. The law grants immunity to a person who uses deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, or to prevent a forcible felony.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby spent that weekend protesting the department's decision. The next day, McGlockton's family sought her help. Drejka was later charged with manslaughter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He pleaded not guilty after he was charged last summer. His trial is scheduled to start in August, according to <a href=""https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/-stand-your-ground-shooter-michael-drejka-murder-trial-set-for-august-2019/1660624030"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WFLA</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though her colleagues may have gotten more national attention in recent years, Rayner-Goolsby said ""there are a lot of women and queer folks that are doing this work"" who ""are powerful voices right now on the front lines."" But they often get pushed aside for ""male charismatic figures that are able to draw crowds,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The fight continues</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Stewart, Merritt and Crump have gained national attention, they've gotten more and more requests to take cases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In recent years, Stewart's office has gotten so many requests, he says he has had to turn down 90% of them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart now represents<strong> </strong>the family of Antwon Golatte, a black man who survived being shot by Chicago police during a traffic stop in 2015, according to <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/02/08/antwon-golatte-chicago-police-shooting-lawsuit/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WBBM-TV</a>. A police review board later ruled the shooting unjustified.

The 12 1/2 year <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentence</a> he received Friday for the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk is outrageous and disturbing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Police are seldom -- if ever -- indicted, much less convicted, for shooting African American men. Yet, where the victim here is a white woman and the police officer is black, he gets the book thrown at him. This sentence is lengthy and unjust,and shows a capitulation by the judge against her oath to administer justice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mohamed Noor, a 33-year-old Somali-American, who was serving as a police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) back on July 15, 2017, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/us/minneapolis-officer-noor-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">had been convicted</a> of murder and manslaughter. <a href=""https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/05/14/mohamed-noor-appeals-conviction-in-shooting-death/"" target=""_blank"">According to</a> local station WCCO, Noor has appealed the conviction. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I've thought and prayed about this for two years, since the time I took"" her life, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Noor said</a> before the sentencing. The state had asked for 150 months, while Noor's attorneys argued for a probationary sentence. During the hearing, Ruszczyk's fiancé, Don Damond, made an emotional statement: ""I'm not sure how such a thing could happen to you, to us."" Before announcing his fate, Judge Kathryn Quaintance said, ""Good people sometimes do bad things."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A court should never succumb to the desire for vengeance. Officer Noor is the first officer convicted in Minnesota in such a circumstance. And he happens to be black. Coincidence? He had <a href=""https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/05/before-sentencing-noor-supporters-speak-of-his-kindness-and-compassion"" target=""_blank"">44 letters</a> submitted to the Court which spoke to his character, gentle nature and community service. His ex-wife even weighed in to inform the court of his humanitarian efforts and kind demeanor -- all to no avail. Even a local legislator wrote a letter urging the court to spare him jail. Nope. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During Noor's trial, the jury of ten men and two women heard from 60 witnesses over the course of a month, whose testimony included prosecution and defense ""use of force"" experts. Not surprisingly, these experts offered completely different opinions as to whether Officer Noor acted ""reasonably"" in discharging a single round of his service revolver into the abdomen of Justine Ruszczyk, who had called 911 to report a possible assault happening in an alley near her home.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From the defense perspective, Officer Noor was ""startled"" in a dark alley and feared for his life. In that darkness, he perceived a deadly threat as he sat in the passenger seat of his police cruiser, and saw someone approaching him and his partner, Matthew Harrity, who was way too close for comfort.  Officer Noor's contention is that he fired upon the perceived threat in order to protect his life and that of his vulnerable partner, who was a sitting duck in the driver's seat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The prosecution countered with a critical question that seemingly said it all: ""What is threatening about blond hair and a pink T-Shirt?"" And with that said, we as a society must address the elephant in the room: Race. Officer Noor is an African American man. Ms. Ruszczyk, the victim, was a white woman from Australia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every police shooting, like other cases, turns on its own set of facts. Those facts are often varied and murky. But despite the factual inconsistencies in some police shooting cases, there is generally one constant: the lack of accountability for the officer firing the weapon. Not in this case. Here, there was an indictment, a prosecution and a guilty verdict. So here's the obvious question: did the race of the officer and the victim play a role in the outcome? What are the moral questions involved in the prosecutor's invoking the victim's ""blondeness"" to imply she posed no threat?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How and why is it that Noor was convicted? When a white officer shoots an African American male, the results too often seem like fait accompli. In those instances, the officers are generally not even indicted, much less found guilty at trial. Some may be quick to contradict this claim by pointing to Officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/us/jason-van-dyke-chicago-police-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Laquan McDonald</a> on October 14, 2014. They may also point to Officer Michael Slager in South Carolina, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Walter Scott </a>in April 4, 2015.  But both of these examples are false comparisons. And in fact, they are not even close.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Van Dyke's case, there was a stomach-turning video completely contradicting Van Dyke's narrative as to what occurred. His police report indicated that McDonald was lunging at him, but on camera, Van Dyke is shown firing repeatedly upon McDonald, even as he lies dying on the ground. In the absence of the video one wonders whether there would have even been a prosecution, much less a conviction? And for his crime, Van Dyke was only sentenced to six years and nine months in prison.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In South Carolina, Michael Slager shot Walter Scott in the back as he was running away. Thereafter, he planted evidence. Perhaps because the jurors could not believe their lying eyes, his case ended in a mistrial. It was not until the Justice Department intervened, and a sought a life sentence, that Slager <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">pled guilty and accepted 20 years</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Noor's situation, there is no video tape nor audio evidence. Both Noor and Garrity wore body cameras but they were not turned on and Noor did not provide a statement. In such a circumstance, the conviction of a police officer is unheard of. In fact, Mike Freeman, the prosecutor in Hennepin County, where Noor was tried and convicted, could not identify a single instance in Minnesota's history where a police officer was convicted in such a circumstance. Coincidence?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, a year before this incident, also in Minnesota, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Philando Castile was killed</a> by Officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop. He was shot seven times even though he specifically told the officer that he had a weapon when he was asked to produce his license and registration. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat, looked on in terror -- as did her four-year-old daughter.   Officer Yanez was tried on three felony counts and acquitted on each. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It seems the jury was persuaded that Officer Yanez legitimately feared for his life. The facts would not allow the prosecutor to ask the question that was asked in Noor's case, namely, ""What is so threatening about a blonde?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The uncomfortable questions about this case don't have good answers, but we must ask them nonetheless. Was Noor afforded the same deference by the jury as his counterparts of a different hue? Unlike other officer-involved shootings, this time, the person wearing a blue uniform was Somali, African American, and Muslim. Can't he be just as frightened as his fellow officers were when they discharged their weapons against unarmed black men?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And should a white suspect be viewed as putting a police officer at ease while a black suspect heightens an officer's fear and anxiety? How and why can a prosecutor argue so matter-of-factly that ""a blonde in a pink shirt"" is harmless, while a person with coarse hair, who happens to be black, represents a significant danger? How stereotypical is that? But that was the very argument made here -- and it was overwhelmingly successful.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Interestingly, the shooting also occurred in the district of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the first naturalized citizen from Africa, the first nonwhite woman from Minnesota, and one of the first two Muslim women, to serve in Congress. In that regard, society has come a long way. But it appears we have much further to go.    </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every life is precious and every questionable police-involved shooting is gut-wrenching. We grieve for the family -- no matter the color. Police shootings provide police departments across the country with an opportunity to learn and to improve. In this case, police procedures were re-evaluated and revamped -- as was officer training. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But while revamping police procedures and training, we need to also revamp our cultural attitudes. The sentencing of Mohamed Noor is not even close to the end of this story. Yes, police must be held accountable for their unlawful transgressions. No one can ever be above the law. But the law must apply with equal force to police officers of every color and origin. Similarly, the way in which jurors evaluate these tragic police shootings should never turn on the color of a victim's hair or skin. Instead, the critical inquiry must continue to be whether the officer reasonably perceived a legitimate threat to his or her life. And that must always be a color-blind assessment.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We need to do some soul searching as a society to see how this could happen. Courts should promote justice -- not propagate injustice. And that's exactly what happened here. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This article has been updated to clarify that Justine Ruszczyk was shot in the abdomen, not the chest.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

""The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">The announcement was a dramatic reversal of a sudden tariff threat that Trump himself announced last week in an attempt to put more pressure on the Mexican government to stem the flow of migrants into the US. Trump spent much of the intervening period out of the country, visiting with European leaders and attending a state dinner in the United Kingdom, while US and Mexican negotiators worked feverishly in Washington to avoid <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/tariffs-us-manufacturing-vietnam/index.html"" target=""_blank"">another escalation in his foreign trade wars.</a></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump has leaned on tariffs as a favorite bargaining mechanism, including in his ongoing dispute with China, with mixed results, and his Mexico threats drew open opposition from top Republican senators as well as blowback from the business community.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His decision to back off three days of intense discussions in Washington between Mexican officials and the Trump administration, with talks between Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and State Department officials lasting for more than 11 hours Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods entering the US if Mexico did not limit the number of Central American migrants moving through the country to the US. He said late Friday, after he had returned to the White House from his <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/politics/donald-trump-mexico-politics-dday-britain-immigration/index.html"" target=""_blank"">visit to Europe for D-Day commemorations</a>, that the Mexican officials had agreed to his demands.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's assertion was met with derision from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has crossed swords with the President repeatedly over immigration -- particularly over Trump's demands for money to build a border wall, which triggered a record-long government shutdown last fall.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late Friday, the New York Democrat tweeted: ""This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to 'greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.' Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A declaration amid a crisis</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The United States and Mexico signed onto a joint declaration as a result of the negotiations. The State Department said in a statement that as part of the agreement, Mexico will take ""unprecedented steps"" to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, including the deployment of its National Guard throughout the country -- giving priority to Mexico's southern border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The countries also agreed that individuals caught crossing into the US from Mexico seeking asylum will be ""rapidly returned"" to Mexico where they will await consideration of their asylum claims. Mexico, the declaration says, will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals. Mexico says it will offer jobs, health care and education to those people. In return, the US must expedite the asylum adjudication process.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The declaration also reiterates the countries' commitment from last year, which emphasizes US support for development in Central America and southern Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, the agreement does not include requiring asylum seekers to first apply for asylum in the US while in Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the US got what it wanted from Mexico in terms of border enforcement and breaking up trafficking networks, the US did not get Mexico to agree to have asylum seekers from Central America face asylum proceedings in Mexico or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Discussions will continue and the two countries may announce further efforts within the next 90 days if necessary, the statement said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The deal comes amid a surge in migrants crossing into the US, straining the resources of federal immigration and border authorities. More than 144,000 migrants were encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/southern-border-migrants/index.html"" target=""_blank"">US Customs and Border Protection said this week</a>, a roughly 32% increase from the previous month and the highest monthly total in more than a decade.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of those, nearly 133,000 crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, including more than 11,000 unaccompanied children.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexico has already pledged to send about 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a bid to cut off the flow of Central American migrants whose journey to the US's southern border has led to the steep spike in border crossings in recent months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But US officials demanded more.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US officials pressed Mexico to change its asylum policy by entering into a ""safe third country"" agreement with the US. Mexico had rejected those offers in the past, but US officials said Mexico was more open to some version of this idea in talks on Thursday. The goal was to require Central American migrants to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/trump-rule-asylum-change/index.html"" target=""_blank"">face asylum proceedings in Mexico</a> or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican officials, meanwhile, urged the US to address the root causes of Central American migration by investing in programs that would reduce poverty and violence in those countries. Trump, though, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/30/politics/state-department-aid-el-slavador-guatemala-honduras/index.html"" target=""_blank"">moved earlier this year to cut US foreign aid to those countries</a>, a move even US officials say is counterproductive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Diplomats celebrate avoiding tariff confrontation</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday night praised his counterpart in the Mexican Foreign Ministry, thanking Ebrard and his team for their hard work in negotiating a deal.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We would like to thank Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard for his hard work to negotiate a set of joint obligations that benefit both the United States and Mexico,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""The United States looks forward to working alongside Mexico to fulfill these commitments so that we can stem the tide of illegal migration across our southern border and to make our border strong and secure.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican Ambassador to the US Martha Barcena also praised Ebrard, and said the deal would address what she called a humanitarian crisis on the border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico will strengthen the measures for the implementation of its immigration law. Provide job, education and health opportunities for people who wait in Mexican territory for the end of their asylum process in the US,"" Barcena tweeted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a news conference following the announcement of the declaration, Ebrard told reporters that it was a fair deal. He said that the Mexican delegation had moderated some of the US' requests, such as a safe third country agreement, which would require asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to make their case for American asylum in Mexico. But Mexico did allow others, such as an expansion to Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would return asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think it is a fair balance because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point,"" he said. ""For instance, they accepted to support the program that Mexico proposed in Central America. They proposed in the first meeting to have (a) third safe state, which is not the case here, which is very important. And on the other hand, we accepted to have a more extended version of 235 and to accelerate the deployment of the national guard. So it's a fair play, I think.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Days of pressured negotiations</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Administration officials had said earlier Friday that they were prepared to move forward with the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">threatened tariffs on Mexico</a>, even as negotiations continued in Washington over addressing the immigration issues at the heart of the standoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration was expected to submit legal notification on Friday of its intention to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">implement tariffs Monday on Mexico</a>, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short said. But Short said Trump could ""turn that off"" over the weekend if negotiations ""continue to go well,"" which appeared to be the route Trump chose Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a legal notification that goes forward today with a plan to implement tariffs on Monday, but I think there is the ability -- if negotiations continue to go well -- that the President can turn that off at some point over the weekend,"" Short had told reporters at the White House on Friday morning.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump faced a Friday deadline to sign an executive order to ensure the tariffs go into effect by Monday, his deadline for Mexico to meet his immigration demands or face a 5% tariff on all exports to the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/white-house-mexico-tariff-immigration-talks/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump on Thursday</a> had said ""a lot of progress was made"" earlier this week in talks with Mexican officials, but repeatedly stood by his vow to impose the tariffs, despite criticism from some Republicans, who have urged him to delay the implementation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/mexico-tariffs-republican-senators-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Some Republican lawmakers had expressed concern</a> about the impact of tariffs on all goods that cross into the US from Mexico, a move that could ultimately lead to higher prices for US consumers and hurt US businesses as well as the Mexican economy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short hit back at the uneasy Republican lawmakers earlier Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We wish that members of Congress would spend as much time looking to fix the problem legislatively as they do bellyaching about what the President is doing trying to fix the problem,"" Short said when asked about Republican opposition to his tariffs.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short said specifically that the administration wants Congress to change US asylum laws that ""allow families to basically come across the border and be protected and let go into our United States until the adjudication process completes.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This story has been updated.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Greg Clary and Jenny Hansler contributed to this report.</p>]"

Maybe once every two years you'd see something like this, if even that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's absolutely no explanation as to how I contracted it,"" said Palma.

The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said.

Two of the three girls were 6-year-old Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, both daughters of Honeychurch.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was an answer to a question that had remained <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/new-hampshire-cold-case-homicides/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a mystery for decades</a>. Authorities on Thursday said the breakthrough was a result of information from relatives, DNA testing, genealogy research — and the diligent research of Heath. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her first lead didn't go anywhere</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In January 2017, investigators announced that a man named Bob Evans had likely killed the four female victims discovered in Bear Brook State Park. In August of that year, they announced that ""Bob Evans"" was an alias for Terrence ""Terry"" Rasmussen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasmussen went by many names over the years. He was linked to the 1981 disappearance of a woman in New Hampshire that he was thought to be dating and was serving time for the murder of his wife in California when he died of natural causes in 2010.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though investigators had identified Rasmussen as the man who likely killed the four Bear Brook victims in 2017, the victims' identities were still a mystery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For years, helping connect people to their missing loved ones had been a hobby of Heath's. Combined with her interest in the Rasmussen case, she got to work on trying to find potential matches for the victims in November 2017. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She scoured ancestry message boards for terms like ""California,"" where Rasmussen had been arrested, or ""missing sister"" in hopes of finding a relative of the victims. Then she began compiling a list of names. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would just go through that list and then I would start searching to see if they had public records, if the person was alive, see if I could find any record for their existence,"" Heath said. ""If not, then I would pursue it a little further and reach out to the person who had originally posted looking for the loved ones.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath said she found a posting from around 1999 about a relative looking for Sarah McWaters and her mother Marlyse McWaters. As she conducted further searches for Marlyse McWaters, Heath came across other relatives looking for the same woman. It turned out McWaters was also the mother of a girl named Marie Vaughn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a Facebook group about the Rasmussen case, Heath asked whether those missing people could be the victims found in Allenstown, but she didn't get much of a response. So, she dropped it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She followed up a year later</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About a year later, Heath, who lives in Connecticut, was listening to a New Hampshire Public Radio podcast about the Bear Brook murders when information about the victims reminded her again of the woman looking for Sarah McWaters on that ancestry message board. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At that point I was like, I need to reach out to this woman,"" Heath said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The listing contained an email address, so Heath said she tried to match the address to a Facebook profile. Heath reached out to one woman asking whether she was the same person who had made the ancestry posting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes, Heath received a response. It was her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath asked the relative if she had any more information about Sarah and Marlyse McWaters. The woman started sharing more details, including that Marlyse had married a man with the last name Rasmussen. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Right there, my stomach jumped,"" Heath said. ""It just rocked. I knew right away. There's no way that a woman goes missing with those children with a guy with that last name, Rasmussen. It's just way too coincidental.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath didn't say anything to the relative of Sarah McWaters about Rasmussen's criminal history just yet, but she said she began reaching out to relatives of Marie Vaughn. Vaughn's relatives told Heath that Vaughn's mother had left California with a man named Terry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>It all came together in the same week</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within two hours, Heath said she was on the phone with law enforcement in San Bernardino, California. Those authorities quickly turned the information over to investigators in New Hampshire who were already examining DNA research based on information from the family of Marie Vaughn and other genetic databases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through advances in DNA technology, investigators were able to obtain DNA profiles of the degraded remains from the barrels. Barbara Rae-Venter, a genetic genealogist who also helped crack the Golden State Killer case, was able to confirm the identities of the victims via searches through DNA databases, according to New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That, plus the information that came in from Heath and the DNA samples from Sarah McWaters' family, allowed them to make the final determination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Her work and our work converged, and it turns out that she was correct,"" Strelzin told CNN.

Merritt says prison and county officials have not been cooperative with providing an official manner of death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Representatives for the prison could not be reached for comment Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">An initial autopsy by the York County Coroner's Office stated Palmer died after an incident ""following an excited state"" during which he ""began hitting his head against the inside of his cell door"" and was restrained. The report says Palmer became agitated as a result of ""methamphetamine toxicity."" A probable ""sickling red cell disorder"" as listed as a contributing factor.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to his family, Palmer never had any health problems leading up to his death. They also say the autopsy report of him hitting himself are completely out of character.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The York County Coroner's Office updated its autopsy results on July 28, 2018, to include a manner of death, which it listed as ""undetermined."" The autopsy report says details of the autopsy may be corrected as more information becomes available.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says Palmer did have ""some history of drug use,"" but never meth. Prison processing reports made available to the family provided no indication that Palmer was under the influence or had any drug paraphernalia listed in his items when he arrived. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He would have had to receive (the meth) in the jail itself. We don't believe that happened,"" Merritt said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer's body was returned to his family, but it was only after the family hired their own independent forensic pathologist that they discovered Palmer's body was missing three body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's not unusual to take organs out of a body during an autopsy, especially if you believe they were subject to trauma. The highly unusual part is to misplace them,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For seven months, the family could not track down Palmer's brain, heart or throat.<strong> </strong>They say they were told by the York County Coroner to check with the funeral home for the body parts. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The funeral home says they hadn't touched the body,"" Merritt said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family says they were later told by the coroner that the body parts were at an independent lab. However, the lab, Merritt says, has refused to hand over the parts, citing an ongoing investigation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt says the family believes the body parts will reveal details of how Palmer died. ""But we haven't been able to get them back yet,"" Merritt said. ""His constitutional rights are being violated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">CNN reached out to the York County District Attorney's Office for comment. Kyle King, the chief administrator and spokesman for the district attorney, told CNN by phone, ""The office of the district attorney does not comment on pending or ongoing investigations.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">When asked how long an investigation into a case like this typically takes, King said, ""Every investigation is unique."" He did not answer when asked why, more than one year after Palmer's death, there is still no official determination about his cause of death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Multiple calls to the Pennsylvania State Police, which is listed as the investigating police agency on the autopsy, were not returned. A voicemail message left with the York County Coroner's Office also went unanswered.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of the five children in the Palmer family, Everett Palmer Jr. was like the glue that kept the family bond strong, his brother Dwayne said. He was a ""gentle giant,"" tall and muscular, and served as a US Army paratrooper. An avid sports fan, especially of basketball, Palmer was often found working out in the gym or helping others achieve their goals as a personal trainer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Palmer also enjoyed being a DJ and had a very ""eclectic taste in music,"" preferring heavy metal, according to his brother, Dwayne. He may have looked imposing, his brother says, but he loved to smile.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""He joked around a lot. He was the life of the family,"" Dwayne Palmer said. ""He wasn't a perfect person, but certainly not somebody that's a rabble-rouser, fighting, starting trouble or anything like that. He was a loving person.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Speaking from his home in New York,<strong> </strong>Dwayne says the family just wants to know what happened. He says the information they have been given so far is scant. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We don't believe anything (officials) are telling us at this point,"" he said. ""It's a tremendous loss for our family. We are devastated.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">According to the autopsy report, on the morning of his death, Everett Palmer Jr. was taken to a medical clinic where he was noted to be unresponsive. He was transferred to York Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""If he was being processed for something that he did wrong in terms of the DUI -- he should be held accountable for that -- but it shouldn't be a death sentence, certainly inside of a jail,"" his brother added. ""We know that there are good people in that prison system. We appeal to them to come forward and share what they know.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Palmer family has put in a Freedom of Information Act request for any video recordings from the York County Prison while Palmer was in their custody.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's been over a year and we want some answers. He was delivered back to us without organs. We want closure,"" Palmer said. ""If something criminal happened, and I believe something criminal did happen, we want the people that was involved in that to be held accountable.""</div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Their tactics are strategic and media-savvy. Their goal is to hold abusive officers accountable and force systemic changes in policing in this country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""When you hear us advocate, we're not advocating for a settlement, we're advocating for an indictment,"" Merritt said. ""We're advocating for a conviction.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The video that changed the narrative</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart arrived at the Scott family home in North Charleston, South Carolina, in the middle of the night, the day after Walter Scott was shot dead. He carried only a duffel bag and two suits, thinking he wouldn't be there for long.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart didn't go home for two months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They started having to FedEx me suits and clothes,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As an attorney, Stewart had mostly handled sexual assault cases in his career. In 2014 he took on the case of Gregory Towns, who died in police custody after two East Point, Georgia, officers used a stun gun on him while he was handcuffed. Both officers were convicted, including one for murder, <a href=""https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/south-fulton-county/former-east-point-officer-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-mans-taser-murder/477823504"" target=""_blank"">according to CNN affiliate WSB-TV</a>. The family and city also settled a lawsuit.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Walter Scott's family had heard about that case -- and so they reached out to Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family was not convinced that the police account of what happened to Scott was accurate. Police said at the time that an officer pulled Scott over for a broken tail light and a foot chase followed. The officer said he used a stun gun on Scott; Scott tried to take that weapon and the officer shot him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We knew my brother and what he was about,"" Anthony Scott told CNN. ""He was never the type of guy that would fight a cop.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The family would later learn that <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2015/04/09/us/south-carolina-witness-video/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Feidin Santana</a>, a bystander, had recorded Walter Scott's last moments.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana had sent a screenshot of the footage to a Black Lives Matter activist, who told Scott's family about it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Santana went to the home of another one of Walter Scott's brothers to meet Stewart and his co-counsel, Justin Bamberg. But Santana didn't want to stay there; he was scared for his life. They drove around and finally settled on a secluded parking lot, Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It took Stewart and Bamberg several hours to convince Santana to show them the video and give it to them. It showed North Charleston police officer Michael Slager shooting Scott in the back as he ran away. ""This can't be real,"" Stewart remembered thinking when he saw the video. ""A police officer wouldn't just unload on somebody like that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late that night, the lawyers turned the video over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division. The state agency released it to the public days after Scott was killed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The video changed the narrative of the shooting and sparked outrage across the country. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Slager was charged with murder and fired. Stewart also helped to secure a $6.5 million settlement for the Scott family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Slager's murder trial ended in <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/05/us/michael-slager-murder-trial-walter-scott-mistrial/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a hung jury</a> in December 2016. Everyone lost hope, but ""we just never gave up on it and kept pushing,"" Stewart said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A year later, Slager was <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentenced to 20 years</a> in a federal prison after he pleaded guilty to violating Scott's civil rights. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Filled with gratitude, Stewart and Scott's family gathered in a back room in the courthouse with the lead prosecutor after the sentencing.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">They held hands in a circle and prayed. Stewart asked Scott's mother, Judy, to speak to the media.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Facing reporters, she held a framed photo of her son against her chest as the nation watched. Stewart spoke first.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He called it ""a historic day for civil rights, particularly in officer-involved shootings."" Stewart wanted to convey the magnitude of such a sentence for a police officer. It was the ""best of inadequate justice"" that civil rights cases get, he said recalling that moment. ""This is all people crave, is accountability.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Nine out of 10 times, the families don't get justice, the community doesn't observe justice and it's just written off,"" Stewart said. ""And it just goes away, then it's just kind of a lasting open wound."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The work takes its toll</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In April 2017, Roy Oliver, then an officer in Balch Springs, Texas, opened fire on a car full of teenagers as they drove past him leaving a party. Police claimed they had heard gunshots outside the house; Oliver said he thought the car was moving aggressively toward his partner.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A bullet struck 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, a passenger in the car, in the head, killing him.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Details of the killing seep into attorney Merritt's dreams, giving him nightmares -- like the way Jordan's brothers described him getting shot, smoke rising from Jordan's forehead.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Instead of it being Jordan, it's my 9-year-old,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Civil rights law is not an easy field, the attorneys say. Cases take years to settle. The work is disruptive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt has struggled with depression. Online trolls forced Stewart to hire private security at his house during the Scott case, and again when he represented the family of Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black father who was shot dead by one of two white officers who confronted him outside a Louisiana convenience store in 2016. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump, 49, has received threatening phone calls and letters over the years.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">L. Chris Stewart, S. Lee Merritt and Benjamin Crump have bonded since serving on a panel at a National Bar Association conference over the summer. They talk often in a group text that includes other civil rights lawyers. The conversation is wide-ranging, jumping from legal strategy to college football to holiday greetings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What everybody respects about each other is that somebody's stepping up doing this, because there are just not a lot of people that will take a civil rights case,"" Stewart said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Police-involved shootings <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/23/us/police-deadly-force-trials/index.html"" target=""_blank"">rarely end in convictions</a>. Jurors and the broader public often give police officers the benefit of the doubt, and there is often a high burden of proof. The federal statute used to evaluate police shootings, for example, requires a finding that the officer willfully or intentionally sought to kill someone. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Approaching new cases, the attorneys' first step is to make sure enough evidence is available and that public pressure is strong enough for charges to be brought.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Jordan's case, Merritt took affidavits from witnesses and directed them to the district attorney's office. A Dallas County grand jury indicted Oliver for murder about three months after the fatal shooting, and his case went to trial. After hours of deliberations, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/28/us/texas-officer-convicted-jordan-edwards-death/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a jury convicted him</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also had success with this strategy when he took on the case of Botham Jean. Amber Guyger, an off-duty Dallas police officer, fired two shots at Jean after she says she mistakenly entered his apartment at a complex where she also lived.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt's office obtained an affidavit from a witness who said they heard knocking on Jean's door shortly before Guyger, who lived directly above Jean, entered his apartment and killed him. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt also called for Guyger to be fired and charged.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Guyger was indicted for murder on December 1. Her trial is set for September 23, according to <a href=""https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2019/04/03/trial-dallas-officer-amber-guyger-botham-jean/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate KTVT</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The roots of their strategy</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham Jean's mother, Allison, had traveled to the United States many times, but she wasn't familiar with the justice system at the time of her son's death.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Botham's aunt, who lives in Florida, reached out to Crump. Allison Jean remembered him from his work representing Trayvon Martin's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A Texas state senator recommended Merritt, but Jean still wasn't sure. She asked a friend who was an attorney in St. Lucia to research Merritt. ""Given what had happened to my son, I was looking at everybody with much apprehension,"" said Jean, a former government official in St. Lucia.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But she quickly grew comfortable with Merritt, Crump and Daryl Washington, a Texas attorney. The three men spent up to 12 hours a day with her during her first week in Dallas, holding her hand at times, she said. Crump often checked to see if she had eaten.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""They met me at the hotel. They came to ... the memorial service,"" she said. ""They met me at the (district attorney's office). We just spent the entire day together, for an entire week. They never left my side,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt kept the Jeans<strong> </strong>company one night after a Dallas County grand jury failed to indict Guyger in its first day of deliberation. He passed the time playing dominoes with Allison Jean's husband.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""That helped to quell my anxiety,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Getting to know the family and their loved one is a crucial part of representing these cases, Crump said. Crump has encouraged his clients to talk publicly about their loved ones to reshape the public narrative about them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We have never met these young people of color, who've been killed by the police, in life,"" Crump said. ""We only meet them in death. And we have to then bring them back to life in the media.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump encourages the families to help the world know the person they knew, and not just the person described in a police report or shown in a grainy viral video.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""You are always going to be more effective in telling who Botham Jean was,"" he told Jean's family.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Because their legal strategy is often tied to media interviews and press conferences, some criticize the attorneys for sowing division -- trying to grab headlines rather than finding common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Charley Wilkison, executive director of the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, a police union, said police are often criticized and second-guessed, but they have the fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the criminal justice system does deserve criticism, he said, it's still important to find common ground.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""While we're preaching tolerance in the country, it kind of behooves all of us to find a middle, that's just very unpopular right now in this country,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""The tolerance that they're calling for is not being practiced,"" he added.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In response, Merritt said that ""when I or other attorneys call out law enforcement for the extremely hazardous, deadly culture that is unique in the world, it's because it's really bad.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I don't know that they get that,"" he said. ""The black community gets it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>How civil rights became their calling</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt, 36, rose to prominence after he represented Mark Hughes, the man Dallas police incorrectly identified as a suspect in the fatal shooting of five officers in a July 2016 protest against police-involved shootings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Merritt said he started a campaign ""to clear him in the eyes of the public.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned much of this legal strategy from Johnnie Cochran, the lead attorney defending O.J. Simpson when he was accused of killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. ""Cochran used to play his cases out in the media, use the media to create political pressure,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Crump credited Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall as his inspiration to practice law. In elementary school, Crump was bused to a new predominantly white school in Lumberton, North Carolina. His mother worked at a factory and a hotel for little pay.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He learned from his mother and teachers that he could attend the school because Marshall, then an attorney for the NAACP, argued Brown v. Board of Education before the US Supreme Court, leading to the desegregation of public schools.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I want to be like Thurgood Marshall because I want to make it good for people who live in my community and people who look like me,"" Crump said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">His respect for Marshall even influences how he decides which cases to take. A case must ""shock my conscience,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart's conscience was shocked by the injustice he saw in a small Florida town more than a decade ago. The Tulane University graduate, who studied public health, found himself angry as he sat in a room in Florida with an attorney and residents who believed they were sick with cancer.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">At the time, Stewart worked for the Environmental Protection Agency, monitoring cancer clusters in low-income communities. Stewart heard the lawyers for the company that owned a chemical plant near a water source -- the suspected cause of the cancer -- laughing about golf in another room. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That flippant attitude angered Stewart.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""> ""If I see something wrong and I think I can do something about it, then I do something about it,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Lesser-known figures on the front lines</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For every one of these attorneys in the national spotlight, there are many others addressing civil rights issues around the country.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Before Michele K. Rayner-Goolsby was born, her parents were among some of the first black students to enroll at the University of South Florida in the 1960s. Her parents taught her to help others and lift her community up as she advanced. She recalled watching her mom, who was a social worker, give a bag of groceries to a homeless client they found standing in front of a grocery store.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby hadn't planned to focus on civil rights cases, but during an internship with a public defenders' office in Florida she began to encounter clients who alleged their rights were violated.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, the 37-year-old attorney represents the family of Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot last summer during an altercation over a parking space at a convenience store in Clearwater, Florida, her hometown. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri initially said he wouldn't arrest Michael Drejka, the man who shot McGlockton, citing the state's ""stand your ground"" law. The law grants immunity to a person who uses deadly force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, or to prevent a forcible felony.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rayner-Goolsby spent that weekend protesting the department's decision. The next day, McGlockton's family sought her help. Drejka was later charged with manslaughter.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">He pleaded not guilty after he was charged last summer. His trial is scheduled to start in August, according to <a href=""https://www.wfla.com/news/pinellas-county/-stand-your-ground-shooter-michael-drejka-murder-trial-set-for-august-2019/1660624030"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WFLA</a>.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though her colleagues may have gotten more national attention in recent years, Rayner-Goolsby said ""there are a lot of women and queer folks that are doing this work"" who ""are powerful voices right now on the front lines."" But they often get pushed aside for ""male charismatic figures that are able to draw crowds,"" she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>The fight continues</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As Stewart, Merritt and Crump have gained national attention, they've gotten more and more requests to take cases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In recent years, Stewart's office has gotten so many requests, he says he has had to turn down 90% of them.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Stewart now represents<strong> </strong>the family of Antwon Golatte, a black man who survived being shot by Chicago police during a traffic stop in 2015, according to <a href=""https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2017/02/08/antwon-golatte-chicago-police-shooting-lawsuit/"" target=""_blank"">CNN affiliate WBBM-TV</a>. A police review board later ruled the shooting unjustified.

The 12 1/2 year <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">sentence</a> he received Friday for the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk is outrageous and disturbing. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph speakable"">Police are seldom -- if ever -- indicted, much less convicted, for shooting African American men. Yet, where the victim here is a white woman and the police officer is black, he gets the book thrown at him. This sentence is lengthy and unjust,and shows a capitulation by the judge against her oath to administer justice. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mohamed Noor, a 33-year-old Somali-American, who was serving as a police officer with the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) back on July 15, 2017, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/us/minneapolis-officer-noor-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">had been convicted</a> of murder and manslaughter. <a href=""https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/05/14/mohamed-noor-appeals-conviction-in-shooting-death/"" target=""_blank"">According to</a> local station WCCO, Noor has appealed the conviction. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I've thought and prayed about this for two years, since the time I took"" her life, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/07/us/minneapolis-mohamed-noor-sentenced/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Noor said</a> before the sentencing. The state had asked for 150 months, while Noor's attorneys argued for a probationary sentence. During the hearing, Ruszczyk's fiancé, Don Damond, made an emotional statement: ""I'm not sure how such a thing could happen to you, to us."" Before announcing his fate, Judge Kathryn Quaintance said, ""Good people sometimes do bad things."" </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A court should never succumb to the desire for vengeance. Officer Noor is the first officer convicted in Minnesota in such a circumstance. And he happens to be black. Coincidence? He had <a href=""https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/05/before-sentencing-noor-supporters-speak-of-his-kindness-and-compassion"" target=""_blank"">44 letters</a> submitted to the Court which spoke to his character, gentle nature and community service. His ex-wife even weighed in to inform the court of his humanitarian efforts and kind demeanor -- all to no avail. Even a local legislator wrote a letter urging the court to spare him jail. Nope. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">During Noor's trial, the jury of ten men and two women heard from 60 witnesses over the course of a month, whose testimony included prosecution and defense ""use of force"" experts. Not surprisingly, these experts offered completely different opinions as to whether Officer Noor acted ""reasonably"" in discharging a single round of his service revolver into the abdomen of Justine Ruszczyk, who had called 911 to report a possible assault happening in an alley near her home.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">From the defense perspective, Officer Noor was ""startled"" in a dark alley and feared for his life. In that darkness, he perceived a deadly threat as he sat in the passenger seat of his police cruiser, and saw someone approaching him and his partner, Matthew Harrity, who was way too close for comfort.  Officer Noor's contention is that he fired upon the perceived threat in order to protect his life and that of his vulnerable partner, who was a sitting duck in the driver's seat.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The prosecution countered with a critical question that seemingly said it all: ""What is threatening about blond hair and a pink T-Shirt?"" And with that said, we as a society must address the elephant in the room: Race. Officer Noor is an African American man. Ms. Ruszczyk, the victim, was a white woman from Australia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every police shooting, like other cases, turns on its own set of facts. Those facts are often varied and murky. But despite the factual inconsistencies in some police shooting cases, there is generally one constant: the lack of accountability for the officer firing the weapon. Not in this case. Here, there was an indictment, a prosecution and a guilty verdict. So here's the obvious question: did the race of the officer and the victim play a role in the outcome? What are the moral questions involved in the prosecutor's invoking the victim's ""blondeness"" to imply she posed no threat?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">How and why is it that Noor was convicted? When a white officer shoots an African American male, the results too often seem like fait accompli. In those instances, the officers are generally not even indicted, much less found guilty at trial. Some may be quick to contradict this claim by pointing to Officer Jason Van Dyke in Chicago, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/18/us/jason-van-dyke-chicago-police-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Laquan McDonald</a> on October 14, 2014. They may also point to Officer Michael Slager in South Carolina, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">who killed Walter Scott </a>in April 4, 2015.  But both of these examples are false comparisons. And in fact, they are not even close.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Van Dyke's case, there was a stomach-turning video completely contradicting Van Dyke's narrative as to what occurred. His police report indicated that McDonald was lunging at him, but on camera, Van Dyke is shown firing repeatedly upon McDonald, even as he lies dying on the ground. In the absence of the video one wonders whether there would have even been a prosecution, much less a conviction? And for his crime, Van Dyke was only sentenced to six years and nine months in prison.   </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In South Carolina, Michael Slager shot Walter Scott in the back as he was running away. Thereafter, he planted evidence. Perhaps because the jurors could not believe their lying eyes, his case ended in a mistrial. It was not until the Justice Department intervened, and a sought a life sentence, that Slager <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/07/us/michael-slager-sentencing/index.html"" target=""_blank"">pled guilty and accepted 20 years</a>. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In Noor's situation, there is no video tape nor audio evidence. Both Noor and Garrity wore body cameras but they were not turned on and Noor did not provide a statement. In such a circumstance, the conviction of a police officer is unheard of. In fact, Mike Freeman, the prosecutor in Hennepin County, where Noor was tried and convicted, could not identify a single instance in Minnesota's history where a police officer was convicted in such a circumstance. Coincidence?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In fact, a year before this incident, also in Minnesota, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/06/16/us/philando-castile-trial-verdict/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Philando Castile was killed</a> by Officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop. He was shot seven times even though he specifically told the officer that he had a weapon when he was asked to produce his license and registration. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was in the passenger seat, looked on in terror -- as did her four-year-old daughter.   Officer Yanez was tried on three felony counts and acquitted on each. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It seems the jury was persuaded that Officer Yanez legitimately feared for his life. The facts would not allow the prosecutor to ask the question that was asked in Noor's case, namely, ""What is so threatening about a blonde?""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The uncomfortable questions about this case don't have good answers, but we must ask them nonetheless. Was Noor afforded the same deference by the jury as his counterparts of a different hue? Unlike other officer-involved shootings, this time, the person wearing a blue uniform was Somali, African American, and Muslim. Can't he be just as frightened as his fellow officers were when they discharged their weapons against unarmed black men?</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And should a white suspect be viewed as putting a police officer at ease while a black suspect heightens an officer's fear and anxiety? How and why can a prosecutor argue so matter-of-factly that ""a blonde in a pink shirt"" is harmless, while a person with coarse hair, who happens to be black, represents a significant danger? How stereotypical is that? But that was the very argument made here -- and it was overwhelmingly successful.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Interestingly, the shooting also occurred in the district of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, the first naturalized citizen from Africa, the first nonwhite woman from Minnesota, and one of the first two Muslim women, to serve in Congress. In that regard, society has come a long way. But it appears we have much further to go.    </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Every life is precious and every questionable police-involved shooting is gut-wrenching. We grieve for the family -- no matter the color. Police shootings provide police departments across the country with an opportunity to learn and to improve. In this case, police procedures were re-evaluated and revamped -- as was officer training. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But while revamping police procedures and training, we need to also revamp our cultural attitudes. The sentencing of Mohamed Noor is not even close to the end of this story. Yes, police must be held accountable for their unlawful transgressions. No one can ever be above the law. But the law must apply with equal force to police officers of every color and origin. Similarly, the way in which jurors evaluate these tragic police shootings should never turn on the color of a victim's hair or skin. Instead, the critical inquiry must continue to be whether the officer reasonably perceived a legitimate threat to his or her life. And that must always be a color-blind assessment.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">We need to do some soul searching as a society to see how this could happen. Courts should promote justice -- not propagate injustice. And that's exactly what happened here. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This article has been updated to clarify that Justine Ruszczyk was shot in the abdomen, not the chest.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Thank you!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump's assertion was met with derision from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has crossed swords with the President repeatedly over immigration -- particularly over Trump's demands for money to build a border wall, which triggered a record-long government shutdown last fall.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Late Friday, the New York Democrat tweeted: ""This is an historic night! @realDonaldTrump has announced that he has cut a deal to 'greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States.' Now that that problem is solved, I'm sure we won't be hearing any more about it in the future.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On Saturday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi responded to the latest development with Mexico, saying in a statement that Trump ""undermined America's preeminent leadership role in the world by recklessly threatening to impose tariffs on our close friend and neighbor to the south."" Congress, she said, will hold the White House ""accountable for its failures to address the humanitarian situation at our southern border.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We are deeply disappointed by the Administration's expansion of its failed Remain-in-Mexico policy, which violates the rights of asylum seekers under US law and fails to address the root causes of Central American migration,"" Pelosi said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Trump earlier Saturday <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137310207401439232"" target=""_blank"">criticized media coverage</a> and said ""the reviews and reporting on our Border Immigration Agreement with Mexico have been very good"" in a series of morning tweets.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!"" the President wrote in <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137313896585474048"" target=""_blank"">a tweet</a>. He <a href=""https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137329348409778177"" target=""_blank"">continued</a> later Saturday: ""MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>A declaration amid a crisis</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The United States and Mexico signed onto a joint declaration as a result of the negotiations. The State Department said in a statement that as part of the agreement, Mexico will take ""unprecedented steps"" to increase enforcement to curb irregular migration, including the deployment of its National Guard throughout the country -- giving priority to Mexico's southern border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The countries also agreed that individuals caught crossing into the US from Mexico seeking asylum will be ""rapidly returned"" to Mexico where they will await consideration of their asylum claims. Mexico, the declaration says, will authorize the entrance of all of those individuals. Mexico says it will offer jobs, health care and education to those people. In return, the US must expedite the asylum adjudication process.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The declaration also reiterates the countries' commitment from last year, which emphasizes US support for development in Central America and southern Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">However, the agreement does not include requiring asylum seekers to first apply for asylum in the US while in Mexico.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While the US got what it wanted from Mexico in terms of border enforcement and breaking up trafficking networks, the US did not get Mexico to agree to have asylum seekers from Central America face asylum proceedings in Mexico or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Discussions will continue and the two countries may announce further efforts within the next 90 days if necessary, the statement said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The deal comes amid a surge in migrants crossing into the US, straining the resources of federal immigration and border authorities. More than 144,000 migrants were encountered or arrested at the US-Mexico border in May, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/southern-border-migrants/index.html"" target=""_blank"">US Customs and Border Protection said this week</a>, a roughly 32% increase from the previous month and the highest monthly total in more than a decade.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of those, nearly 133,000 crossed the US-Mexico border illegally, including more than 11,000 unaccompanied children.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexico has already pledged to send about 6,000 National Guard troops to its southern border with Guatemala in a bid to cut off the flow of Central American migrants whose journey to the US's southern border has led to the steep spike in border crossings in recent months.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But US officials demanded more.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">US officials pressed Mexico to change its asylum policy by entering into a ""safe third country"" agreement with the US. Mexico had rejected those offers in the past, but US officials said Mexico was more open to some version of this idea in talks on Thursday. The goal was to require Central American migrants to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/politics/trump-rule-asylum-change/index.html"" target=""_blank"">face asylum proceedings in Mexico</a> or the first country they cross through, rather than in the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican officials, meanwhile, urged the US to address the root causes of Central American migration by investing in programs that would reduce poverty and violence in those countries. Trump, though, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/30/politics/state-department-aid-el-slavador-guatemala-honduras/index.html"" target=""_blank"">moved earlier this year to cut US foreign aid to those countries</a>, a move even US officials say is counterproductive.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Diplomats celebrate avoiding tariff confrontation</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday night praised his counterpart in the Mexican Foreign Ministry, thanking Ebrard and his team for their hard work in negotiating a deal.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We would like to thank Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard for his hard work to negotiate a set of joint obligations that benefit both the United States and Mexico,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""The United States looks forward to working alongside Mexico to fulfill these commitments so that we can stem the tide of illegal migration across our southern border and to make our border strong and secure.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Mexican Ambassador to the US Martha Barcena also praised Ebrard, and said the deal would address what she called a humanitarian crisis on the border.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Mexico will strengthen the measures for the implementation of its immigration law. Provide job, education and health opportunities for people who wait in Mexican territory for the end of their asylum process in the US,"" Barcena tweeted.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a news conference following the announcement of the declaration, Ebrard told reporters that it was a fair deal. He said that the Mexican delegation had moderated some of the US' requests, such as a safe third country agreement, which would require asylum seekers traveling through Mexico to make their case for American asylum in Mexico. But Mexico did allow others, such as an expansion to Section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would return asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I think it is a fair balance because they have more drastic measures and proposals at the start and we reached some middle point,"" he said. ""For instance, they accepted to support the program that Mexico proposed in Central America. They proposed in the first meeting to have (a) third safe state, which is not the case here, which is very important. And on the other hand, we accepted to have a more extended version of 235 and to accelerate the deployment of the national guard. So it's a fair play, I think.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Days of pressured negotiations</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Administration officials had said earlier Friday that they were prepared to move forward with the <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">threatened tariffs on Mexico</a>, even as negotiations continued in Washington over addressing the immigration issues at the heart of the standoff.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The Trump administration was expected to submit legal notification on Friday of its intention to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/06/politics/trump-tariffs-moving-ahead-mexico/index.html"" target=""_blank"">implement tariffs Monday on Mexico</a>, Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff Marc Short said. But Short said Trump could ""turn that off"" over the weekend if negotiations ""continue to go well,"" which appeared to be the route Trump chose Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's a legal notification that goes forward today with a plan to implement tariffs on Monday, but I think there is the ability -- if negotiations continue to go well -- that the President can turn that off at some point over the weekend,"" Short had told reporters at the White House on Friday morning.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Trump faced a Friday deadline to sign an executive order to ensure the tariffs go into effect by Monday, his deadline for Mexico to meet his immigration demands or face a 5% tariff on all exports to the US.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/white-house-mexico-tariff-immigration-talks/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump on Thursday</a> had said ""a lot of progress was made"" earlier this week in talks with Mexican officials, but repeatedly stood by his vow to impose the tariffs, despite criticism from some Republicans, who have urged him to delay the implementation. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/mexico-tariffs-republican-senators-trump/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Some Republican lawmakers had expressed concern</a> about the impact of tariffs on all goods that cross into the US from Mexico, a move that could ultimately lead to higher prices for US consumers and hurt US businesses as well as the Mexican economy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short hit back at the uneasy Republican lawmakers earlier Friday.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We wish that members of Congress would spend as much time looking to fix the problem legislatively as they do bellyaching about what the President is doing trying to fix the problem,"" Short said when asked about Republican opposition to his tariffs.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Short said specifically that the administration wants Congress to change US asylum laws that ""allow families to basically come across the border and be protected and let go into our United States until the adjudication process completes.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>This story has been updated.</em></div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer"">CNN's Greg Clary, Jenny Hansler and Eli Watkins contributed to this report.</p>]"

""It took me about 10 mins to check with the reporter who wrote the original Dutch story.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">After she called out the outlets who had misreported the story, many began to tweak headlines and change copy, some without issuing corrections.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><a href=""https://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2019/06/why-international-newspapers-reported-the-death-of-noa-pothoven-as-euthanasia-when-it-wasnt/"" target=""_blank"">According to a Dutch news report</a>, many British news outlets were initially alerted to the story by Central European News (CEN), a newswire service that specializes in foreign tabloid stories. CEN has previously been accused of providing unreliable information to clients, an accusation CEN fervently denies.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Michael Leidig, who runs the agency, told CNN that when it became clear CEN's original report mischaracterized Pothoven's death, they published a new story describing the way she ended her life as a ""legal gray zone.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Dyck Bosscher, a spokesman for the Dutch Voluntary Termination of Life Association (NVVE), which established Levenseinde, the end-of-life clinic where Pothoven sought out assisted suicide, said this case was clear-cut -- she did not die by euthanasia. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is a lot of misunderstanding about our legislation around euthanasia,"" Bosscher told CNN. ""The media reports make it seem as if it is easy to get euthanasia in the Netherlands, but it's not the truth.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In the Netherlands, euthanasia and assisted suicide are strictly defined as ""the active termination of life at a patient's voluntary and well-informed request,"" according to <a href=""https://www.knmg.nl/actualiteit-opinie/nieuws/nieuwsbericht/euthanasia-in-the-netherlands.htm"" target=""_blank"">the Royal Dutch Medical Association</a>; both were legalized in the country in 2002. <a href=""https://www.government.nl/topics/euthanasia/euthanasia-assisted-suicide-and-non-resuscitation-on-request"" target=""_blank"">According to Dutch law</a>, patients as young as 12 may request and receive euthanasia with parental consent. For those age 16 and 17, parents must be aware of the request.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bosscher explained that gaining approval was a complex, lengthy process under the criteria set out by Dutch law. Over the course of multiple interviews, those seeking euthanasia must convince a doctor that their request is voluntary, they are suffering unbearably, have exhausted all alternative options and are capable of understanding the weight of their decision, he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And, in cases like Pothoven's, when the patient is living with mental illness, the application is even more difficult, because the burden of proof is so high.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Of the patients who are approved to receive euthanasia by the Levenseinde clinic, <a href=""https://www.levenseindekliniek.nl/en/facts-figures/"" target=""_blank"">only 9% are psychiatric patients</a>. The rest are living with cancer or another disease.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Last December, Pothoven told Dutch newspaper <a href=""https://www.gelderlander.nl/home/noa-16-uit-arnhem-is-nu-al-klaar-met-haar-verwoeste-leven~a01a7bd1/"" target=""_blank"">the Gelderlander</a> that she was devastated to be denied euthanasia by the clinic. ""They are of the opinion that I am too young to die. They believe I need to receive trauma focused treatment first and wait until my brain is fully developed. That won't happen until I am 21. I am devastated because I cannot wait that long,"" she said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Ethics of euthanasia</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">While inaccurate reports about Pothoven's death spread from Australia to the United States, the story also fueled a long-running debate over the ethics of euthanasia -- particularly in Italy.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">#NoaPothoven began trending on Italian Twitter and even grabbed the attention of the Pope, who appeared to refer to the case in a subtweet.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Euthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all,"" Pope Francis posted on Twitter. ""We are called never to abandon those who are suffering, never giving up but caring and loving to restore hope.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And after major Italian outlets like la Repubblica, Corriere della Sera, ANSA and AGI misreported that Pothaven was euthanised, far-right politician Giorgia Meloni of the Brothers of Italy party declared that Pothoven's death was ""a defeat of an entire civilization that has stopped defending life.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was only after Italian politician Marco Cappato, a former member of European Parliament who has campaigned for legal euthanasia in Italy, cited local Dutch media to debunk the reports, that some Italian media outlets issued a correction.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bioethicists say confusion around the definition of euthanasia helps fuel misinformation.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There is genuine confusion about what constitutes euthanasia and it's quite tempting to conflate it with the withdrawal of treatment,"" Iain Brassington, a bioethicist and senior lecturer at the University of Manchester in northern England, told CNN. ""What's crucial is the intention.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Brassington, whose research centers on autonomy and euthanasia, said reporting on assisted dying can quickly become emotive and polarized. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those two things together -- polarizing content that elicits an emotional response -- are key ingredients in the spread of misinformation.  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And the consequences of false reporting in places like Italy can have wide-ranging effects on passing end-of-life care legislation elsewhere.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">NVVE's spokesman Dyck Bosscher told CNN, in Italy false stories like this regarding euthanasia serve to, ""warn people that they should never have this liberal legislation ... to underline that this is a slippery slope.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Philip Nitschke, an Australian activist and founder of the pro-euthanasia group Exit International, said that while the false story was being touted by the religious right, and others who are against euthanasia, it had also provided a rare opportunity to discuss the issue on a global level.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""What you see is a whole spectrum of opinions from those who believe it is never right to give away your life, and I imagine the Pope falls into that category, through to those who see it as a human right, to be able to decide when and how to give away your life,"" Nitschke, whose offices are based in Amsterdam, told CNN.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""It's quite a good thing to open up the debate.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><em>For support outside of the US, a worldwide directory of resources and international hotlines is provided by the </em><a href=""https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/"" target=""_blank""><em>International Association for Suicide Prevention</em></a><em>.

""They said, 'If you're not actually having a brain bleed, then it's not actually an emergency,' "" she said.  A seizure disorder was also investigated and quickly dismissed. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">On a brain scan, Palma's primary care physician detected a small lesion in the left frontal lobe of her brain and immediately sent her to <a href=""https://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/jonathan-j-rasouli"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Jonathan Rasouli, </a>chief resident of neurosurgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, and his colleagues.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We decided it would probably be in her best interest to do a biopsy of this lesion,"" said Rasouli based on the fact that she was healthy and young and was having symptoms that he could directly correlate to the location of the lesion. Besides, she had no risk factors for anything else that might explain the presence of a brain lesion. Rasouli carefully explained the possibilities to his patient.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I was told that it was most likely a malignant tumor which would require radiation and chemo even after the surgery,"" said Palma. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The surgery would be risky because the location of her ""tumor"" was very close to the brain region that controls speech.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli told CNN, ""Her fiancé had just proposed to her and they were looking to move in together and then all of a sudden she had this diagnosis of a brain tumor.

I still think the risk was worth it.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Her first operation, essentially a ""planning surgery,"" explained Rasouli, took place on September 2, 2018. A second surgery to remove the suspected tumor followed on September 12. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We did a small dissection of the brain tissue and what we saw was a very well encapsulated, firm lesion that was ovoid,"" said Rasouli. ""It looked like a quail egg: Same size, same look, same firmness.""<strong> </strong></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Wait a second, this is clearly not a brain tumor,"" he recalled saying at the time. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Asked what a brain tumor looks like, he laughed: ""It doesn't look like a quail egg.

""If you live in the US, it's almost impossible to get this.""  </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Those most at risk are those who travel to countries where this pork tapeworm is endemic and eat contaminated food -- usually raw fruits, raw vegetables or uncooked pork. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasouli said that the tapeworm found in her brain ""is not super-duper rare, it's just pretty uncommon. Maybe once every two years you'd see something like this, if even that.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""There's absolutely no explanation as to how I contracted it,"" said Palma. She's never traveled outside the country and she doesn't eat raw foods or raw meat, at least not intentionally, she said. How long it had been lodged in her brain is another mystery, she said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We're still really scratching our heads about how she developed this,"" said Rasouli. ""If we had any suspicion that she could have been exposed to pork tapeworm or we thought this was potentially a parasite, we ideally would have treated her with antibiotics rather than taking her into surgery.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Today, Palma has no symptoms and is feeling fine.

Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics who led a study into the volcano, believes it should be reclassified as active. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At any moment, an eruption can occur,"" Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Between 1999 and September 2017, about 100 weak seismic events were detected beneath the volcano, which stands at 9,590 feet above sea level. An ""anomalous increase"" in seismicity, however, began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and February 2019, about 2,400 seismic events were recorded.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">February saw an earthquake of 4.3 magnitude occur under Udina -- the strongest seismic event ever to occur in the area.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Researchers from Russia, Egypt and Saudi Arabia conducted a study of the volcano last year between May and July, which was published in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Installing four temporary seismic monitoring stations around Bolshaya Udina, the researchers recorded and analyzed 559 seismic events. An ""elliptical cluster"" of seismic activity had formed around the volcano, they determined, with seismic events taking place more than three miles beneath the surface. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""These seismic properties may indicate the presence of magma intrusions with a high content of [...] fluids, which may justify changing the current status of this volcano from 'extinct' to 'active,'"" the researchers wrote.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Moreover, they observed that the cluster of seismic events connected the volcano with the Tolud zone, to the south of the volcano, a region believed to store magma in the Earth's lower crust. The Tolud zone was now feeding Bolshaya Udina with magma, they concluded, thanks to a new pathway that developed in 2018.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Bolshaya Udina shares structural characteristics with another formerly extinct volcano in the region, the Bezymianny, which erupted dramatically in 1956, Koulakov told CNN. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">There is around a 50% chance that Bolshaya Udina will erupt, he said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Or it could just release the energy smoothly over a few months, or it may just disappear without any eruption,"" he said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">If the volcano does erupt, it could pose a significant threat to the small villages nearby, he said, though he added: ""There are not many people around.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">A sizable eruption could also affect the climate in ""completely different parts of the world,"" he said. Ash released by the eruption could spread beyond Russia, disrupting air travel.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Unfortunately, the volcano is difficult to monitor, thanks to its distance from permanent seismic stations, Koulakov said. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""We need to deploy more stations to understand if it's dangerous or not,"" he said.

""I didn't know that an umbrella is not a flying object, which flew in in the first game of the match, but that's their decision.

And what a chance it was. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">As the drop shots accumulated, Djokovic comfortably got to one of Thiem's but pushed his forehand long. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It took a toll, as this time Djokovic buckled in the next game when his volley clipped the tape and dropped on his side. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">You could say the net was rooting for Thiem, given that at another stage one of the Austrian's passing shots struck the tape and turned into a lob over the stranded Djokovic. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Djokovic saved a break point at 1-4, with the rain once again intervening to stop play. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Dramatic last set</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Incredibly the first point after the hour delay -- which cut into the women's final due to start at 3 pm local time between Ashleigh Barty and Marketa Vondrousova -- saw Djokovic and Campistol disagreeing about a ball mark when the Serb stopped playing off a Thiem ball near the baseline.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The point thus going to Thiem, Djokovic saved the second break point with a good serve then broke for 3-4.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">With all the momentum Djokovic, however, stuttered -- crumbling from 30-0 to trail 5-3.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The drama, though, didn't end there.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Seemingly cruising to victory at 40-15, Thiem missed a pair of backhand slices -- one into the net and one wide -- on two match points.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">And on a break point, he snatched at his backhand and sent it into the net.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">But Djokovic couldn't save a third match point at 5-6, as Thiem blasted a forehand winner to book a clash with Nadal.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Thiem improved to 2-1 against Djokovic at the French Open but hasn't taken a set off Nadal in their three Paris tussles. </div>, <p class=""zn-body__paragraph zn-body__footer""></p>]"

Two of the three girls were 6-year-old Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and 1-year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters, both daughters of Honeychurch.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">It was an answer to a question that had remained <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/26/us/new-hampshire-cold-case-homicides/index.html"" target=""_blank"">a mystery for decades</a>. Authorities on Thursday said the breakthrough was a result of information from relatives, DNA testing, genealogy research — and the diligent research of Heath. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>Her first lead didn't go anywhere</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In January 2017, investigators announced that a man named Bob Evans had likely killed the four female victims discovered in Bear Brook State Park. In August of that year, they announced that ""Bob Evans"" was an alias for Terrence ""Terry"" Rasmussen.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Rasmussen went by many names over the years. He was linked to the 1981 disappearance of a woman in New Hampshire that he was thought to be dating and was serving time for the murder of his wife in California when he died of natural causes in 2010.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Though investigators had identified Rasmussen as the man who likely killed the four Bear Brook victims in 2017, the victims' identities were still a mystery.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">For years, helping connect people to their missing loved ones had been a hobby of Heath's. Combined with her interest in the Rasmussen case, she got to work on trying to find potential matches for the victims in November 2017. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">She scoured ancestry message boards for terms like ""California,"" where Rasmussen had been arrested, or ""missing sister"" in hopes of finding a relative of the victims. Then she began compiling a list of names. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""I would just go through that list and then I would start searching to see if they had public records, if the person was alive, see if I could find any record for their existence,"" Heath said. ""If not, then I would pursue it a little further and reach out to the person who had originally posted looking for the loved ones.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath said she found a posting from around 1999 about a relative looking for Sarah McWaters and her mother Marlyse McWaters. As she conducted further searches for Marlyse McWaters, Heath came across other relatives looking for the same woman. It turned out McWaters was also the mother of a girl named Marie Vaughn.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">In a Facebook group about the Rasmussen case, Heath asked whether those missing people could be the victims found in Allenstown, but she didn't get much of a response. So, she dropped it.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>She followed up a year later</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">About a year later, Heath, who lives in Connecticut, was listening to a New Hampshire Public Radio podcast about the Bear Brook murders when information about the victims reminded her again of the woman looking for Sarah McWaters on that ancestry message board. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""At that point I was like, I need to reach out to this woman,"" Heath said.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">The listing contained an email address, so Heath said she tried to match the address to a Facebook profile. Heath reached out to one woman asking whether she was the same person who had made the ancestry posting. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within minutes, Heath received a response. It was her. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath asked the relative if she had any more information about Sarah and Marlyse McWaters. The woman started sharing more details, including that Marlyse had married a man with the last name Rasmussen. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Right there, my stomach jumped,"" Heath said. ""It just rocked. I knew right away. There's no way that a woman goes missing with those children with a guy with that last name, Rasmussen. It's just way too coincidental.""</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Heath didn't say anything to the relative of Sarah McWaters about Rasmussen's criminal history just yet, but she said she began reaching out to relatives of Marie Vaughn. Vaughn's relatives told Heath that Vaughn's mother had left California with a man named Terry.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph""><h3>It all came together in the same week</h3></div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Within two hours, Heath said she was on the phone with law enforcement in San Bernardino, California. Those authorities quickly turned the information over to investigators in New Hampshire who were already examining DNA research based on information from the family of Marie Vaughn and other genetic databases.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">Through advances in DNA technology, investigators were able to obtain DNA profiles of the degraded remains from the barrels. Barbara Rae-Venter, a genetic genealogist who also helped crack the Golden State Killer case, was able to confirm the identities of the victims via searches through DNA databases, according to New Hampshire Associate Attorney General Jeffrey Strelzin. </div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">That, plus the information that came in from Heath and the DNA samples from Sarah McWaters' family, allowed them to make the final determination.</div>, <div class=""zn-body__paragraph"">""Her work and our work converged, and it turns out that she was correct,"" Strelzin told CNN.
