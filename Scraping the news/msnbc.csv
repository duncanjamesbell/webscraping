2,Trump becomes first sitting U.S. president to step into North Korea,3,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-kim-jong-un-meet-dmz-n1025041,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,donald-trump,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SEOUL, South Korea — Taking an unprecedented step onto North Korean soil, President Donald Trump announced Sunday that Washington and Pyongyang will relaunch stalled nuclear talks. The statement came during an <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank"">extraordinary last-minute meeting with Kim Jong Un</a>, the North Korean leader.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Side-by-side with Kim in the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to cross the 1953 armistice line separating North and South Korea, then joined Kim for a roughly 50-minute meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was their third since Trump took office, but none have yet yielded a nuclear deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Stepping across that line was a great honor,"" Trump said, later adding that it was ""something incredible.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump deemed the meeting a victory, announcing that nuclear talks would resume ""within weeks"" and that the two countries were designating teams of officials to take the lead.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He even invited Kim, who rarely leaves the country, to visit him at the White House.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet for all the fanfare, there were no signs that the U.S. and the North had made any concrete <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-iran-policy-deepening-mistrust-north-korea-experts-say-n1021901"" target=""_blank"">progress on denuclearization</a>, the issue that has led to North Korea's estrangement from the world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And veteran nuclear negotiators and North Korea experts immediately questioned whether Trump, by staging a high-profile photo-op absent nuclear concessions, was bestowing legitimacy on Kim and undermining global pressure to force the North to accept a denuclearization deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We can only call it historic if it leads to something,"" said Victor Cha, a former Asia director at the White House and an NBC News contributor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The meeting capped an unpredictable three days of diplomacy in which Trump, while in nearby Japan for the G-20 summit of world leaders,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank""> issued an invitation to Kim on Twitter to meet him in the DMZ</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea reacted positively, calling the proposal ""interesting,"" but did not confirm that Kim would accept until the last minute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Even as Trump traveled by helicopter to the DMZ accompanied by a massive security contingent, U.S. officials had told NBC News they were unsure whether Kim would really show up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And when he did, his handshake with Trump and their ensuing talks unfolded in chaotic fashion under overcast skies. Journalists jostled to capture the historic encounter and even White House officials accompanying the president seemed unsure what would happen next.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This means that we can feel at ease,"" Kim said of the meeting through a translator. ""I believe that this will have a positive force on all of our discussions in the future.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a nod to the unforeseen nature of their rendezvous in the DMZ, Kim told Trump that he ""never expected” to see the president “at this place.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed mid-afternoon in the DMZ and rushed to a vista overlooking North Korea. Sean Morrow, commander of the U.N. Security Battalion, briefed Trump about the security situation, gesturing toward North Korean territory.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Minutes later, Trump and Kim were side by side posing for photos and taking a step together over the line into North Korea. They then spoke briefly to reporters inside a nearby room before holding talks that Trump had predicted would last just a few minutes but went on for close to an hour.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both leaders predicted it would lead to better things to become between their two countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Of striking a nuclear deal, Trump said: ""We're not looking for speed, we're looking to get it right.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was already the first U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader while in office, having met with Kim twice before. This marks the first meeting in the no-man’s-land between North and South since the end of the Korean War.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-begins-one-one-kim-jong-un-tempering-expectations-n977466"" target=""_blank"">Trump’s last summit with Kim — in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February — collapsed abruptly</a>, with a planned signing ceremony scrapped and Trump explaining to reporters that “sometimes you have to walk.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the center of that failure, U.S. officials have said, was Kim’s insistence that all nuclear sanctions be lifted in exchange for only some concessions sought by the U.S. from Pyongyang related to its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But a senior Trump administration official told NBC News ahead of the meeting Sunday that the administration was hoping that even a handshake might jump-start negotiations at a lower level led by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those talks could then focus on making more substantive progress on the nuclear issues.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Trump said after the meeting that Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be handling the relaunched nuclear talks between the countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And while Trump said that sanctions on the North would remain in place for now, he seemed to leave open the possibility that some could be removed during the talks, a shift from the longstanding U.S. position that all sanctions remain in place until a denuclearization deal is struck.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""At some point during the negotiation, things can happen,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">National security hawks and many of Trump’s critics have warned that such meetings plays into Kim's hands, boosting him domestically and providing room for Pyongyang to continue to stall while it moves ahead with its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads and the ability to mount them on missiles, but has yet to prove it can deliver those nuclear-tipped missiles successfully to distances as remote as the U.S. mainland.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet Trump projected no sense of urgency on Sunday as he argued there was plenty of time to reach a deal with North Korea, echoing an argument he'd made about resolving the Iran nuclear issue the day before.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’m never in a rush,” Trump said. “If you’re in a rush, you get yourself in trouble.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both Trump and Kim offered invitations to the other to visit their capitals, with Trump saying, ""I’ll invite him to the White House right now.” Kim said it would be a “great honor” if Trump visited Pyongyang.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Neither of those are likely to occur in the short term given the immense logistical and security challenges of arranging such a visit between countries that do not have diplomatic relations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet as he talked up his own diplomatic achievements, Trump took significant liberties with history.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said inaccurately that former President Barack Obama had wanted to meet with Kim but been rejected. He also claimed that tensions with the North had dissipated as soon as he took office, when in fact Trump engaged in a war of words with the North — including his threat to unleash “fire and fury” — that caused significant alarm across Asia and beyond.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ve had peace for two and a half years,"" Trump said Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president also glossed over reports that <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-carrying-out-purge-after-n1012251"" target=""_blank"">Kim had ordered some of his negotiators executed</a> following the failed Hanoi summit. Asked whether they were still alive, Trump said ""I think they are,"" adding that the main person the U.S. was familiar with was still living.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I would hope the rest are too,"" Trump said. ""I would really hope the rest are too. ""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier, standing with Moon at the Blue House, South Korea’s equivalent of the White House, Trump said that he and Kim “understand each other, I do believe.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that both he and Kim wanted to hold the meeting “from the beginning.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“He understands me, and I believe I maybe understand him,” Trump said. “Sometimes that can lead to very good things.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moon, a liberal in South Korea’s political world who has pushed hard for more engagement with the North, had said ahead of the Trump-Kim meeting that he planned to let the two leaders meet privately, saying that ""as for an inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen a later time.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea, after all, had publicly admonished South Korea for trying to mediate between it and the U.S.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in the end, Moon did join the U.S. and North Korean leaders for part of their meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has played an unusual role in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy, wrote on Twitter that he was wishing ""my friends"" Trump and Kim ""a very good meeting.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Much love to you both and keep up the wonderful progress!""

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>, <p>Don't miss out.

As Putin smiled broadly, Trump briefly raised his finger toward Putin before turning away and repeating: ""Don’t meddle in the election.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over the din in the meeting room, it was unclear whether Trump had initially said, ""Don't meddle in the election, please,"" or ""Don't meddle in the election, president.""

In her meeting with Putin at the G-20, May also confronted the Russian president on Moscow's actions in Ukraine, LGBT rights and what she called ""irrefutable evidence"" that Russia used a chemical weapon on British soil.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Trump's meeting with Putin got underway, he told reporters they would be discussing trade, disarmament and “a little protectionism, perhaps.” The White House later said they had discussed Iran, Syria and Ukraine and had agreed “that improved relations between the United States and Russia was in each countries’ mutual interest and the interest of the world.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Putin, for his part, said the two leaders had much to discuss in Osaka, noting that they had not seen each other since the Helsinki summit. Still, he said through a translator that their teams had been working together in the interim and said their session in Osaka would be “a great opportunity to follow up on that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two sat side to side in front of Russian and American flags, flanked by their delegation. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump’s senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Accompanying Putin were Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other Russian officials.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A White House description of the meeting later said Trump had told Putin that “a 21st century model of arms control” must include China.

The flowering evergreens that can tower to 85 feet comprise 80 percent of the state’s canopy, covering 1 million acres, and its nectar sustains birds and insects found nowhere else on Earth.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now, public agencies and private citizens are trying to avoid biological and economic catastrophe by proclaiming war against a deadly fungal disease coined “rapid ʻōhiʻa death,” or ROD, that is swiftly destroying the trees. What’s more, invasive species like the miconia tree, native to North and South America and called the “green cancer” of Hawaii’s forests, are choking out the ʻōhiʻa.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The disappearance of these trees would have a major impact on Hawaii,” said Clyde Imada, a botanical research specialist at the <a href=""http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/waipio/index.html"">Bishop Museum</a> of natural and cultural history in Honolulu. “Recreationally, outdoor forest experiences in natural areas will be significantly altered.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Birds, insects and plants will be direly affected,"" he continued. ""The ‘ōhi‘a forest experience can’t be re-created with substitute species.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More than 2 million ʻōhiʻa trees have been killed by ROD, according to the U.S. Forest Service, and about <a href=""https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/rod/THE-DISEASE"">135,000 acres</a> show symptoms of the disease that was first identified on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, in 2014. Two years later, the state <a href=""https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/blog/main/nr-ohiaquarantine/"">imposed a quarantine</a> to prevent ROD from spreading to other islands. It didn’t work. The <a href=""https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/12/22/fungus-behind-rapid-ohia-death-is-spreading-kauai/"">most aggressive form of the fungus was found on Kauai</a> late last year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Manakō Tanaka, a Hawaiian culture expert at the Oahu Visitors Bureau, said the ʻōhiʻalehua tree and its blossoms have always been ""the first to sprout up after lava flows that wipe forests out.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And so it’s become synonymous with the bravest of warriors who were the strongest and first into battle.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tree is also associated with Laka, the goddess of hula, its flower used in leis for the traditional Hawaiian dance. <a href=""https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/03/31/hawaii-news/ohia-lehua-blight-takes-toll-on-hula-competition/"">In 2016, for the first time in more than 50 years, </a>many hula schools were forced to forgo their adornments because of diminishing ʻōhiʻa stock.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It would be heartbreaking to only be able to show pictures of the tree and its flowers to future generations,” Tanaka said. “Losing the ʻōhiʻa lehua would be like losing a reference encyclopedia into the past.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Experts believe the fungus may have been carried to the islands by unwitting tourists, perhaps on their shoes or hiking boots. It can also be transmitted by dirty tools, woodland animals or the wind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is speculation visitors are responsible for bringing this disease to Hawaii Island,” said Sam Gon, senior scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. “Either because they were uninformed or uncaring about the need to sanitize their gear. ROD could have a devastating effect on our environment and economy, and we need to reform tourism practices among visitors.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The federal government has attempted to stop the fungus and tackle invasive species by imposing a quarantine on Hawaii Island and carrying out extensive tests to learn how the fungus spreads, but it has yet to find a solution. Hawaiian organizations, communities and scientists are now stepping in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gunstock Ranch, a horse riding stable and tourist destination on Oahu, is replanting native trees, although not the ʻōhi‘a yet. After conducting a survey on 80 acres of its land in 2016, and finding just two native species, owner Greg Smith established a Hawaiian <a href=""https://gunstockranch.com/hawaiian-legacy-forest/"">“legacy forest,”</a> where visitors can plant trees and monitor their growth online.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Our hope is that as our guests plant and dedicate a tree they will form a new connection to the land and Hawaii and leave knowing that they made a difference,” Smith said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some tourism companies are sending staff members to workshops to learn how to protect native species through improved biological sanitation practices. Joshua Nipp, founder of <a href=""https://www.offthebeatenpath.com/"">Off the Beaten Path</a> travel company, hopes to establish a bio-sanitation certification program for tour operators.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A coalition of state agencies called the <a href=""https://www.cgaps.org/why-should-we-care/"">Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species</a> is pushing for stronger regulations and tracking of biological products entering Hawaii.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tanaka said tourists can play an important role in staving off ROD, particularly on islands like Oahu, which has not yet been infected with the fungus. He said they should always make sure their shoes are clean and free of debris and seeds, and he urged visitors to stay away from areas marked off-limits to protect delicate ecosystems.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is a proverb in Hawaiian, ‘I aliʻi ka ‘āina, i kauā ke kanaka.’ It means, ‘The land is chief, and men are its stewards,’” Tanaka said. “Sometimes, though, I fear that we may be moving to a world where people think it is the other way around.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
14,"As Facebook cracks down on hate speech, it's also re-evaluating another policy: Nipples",15,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-cracks-down-hate-speech-it-s-also-re-evaluating-n1024746,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,tech-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The first time Savannah Spirit remembers Facebook censoring her work takes her back to 2011.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was curating a show of erotic art in New York and posted a promotional image to Facebook. The social network promptly took it down, and she was prevented from posting anything else for 10 days.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In the coming years, Spirit, like many other artists, would move to Instagram, where her edgier art — usually with some form of nudity — would often run afoul of the company’s policies and be removed. Complaints and protests from artists and arts organizations in real life and on social media, including at least <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity"">one that went viral</a>, made little progress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I started to decide that it just comes with the territory,” Spirit said of Facebook’s bans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But arts organizations kept at it. In early June, 125 people protested in the nude outside the New York City headquarters of Facebook and Instagram, covering themselves with stickers of photographed male nipples in protest of the long-argued double standard that only female nipples are against the company’s policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The artists’ action speaks to just how important the platforms, especially Instagram, have become to the arts now that Tumblr — once a haven for artists — <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tumblr-ban-all-adult-content-n943226"">does not allow any adult content</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Instagram has been so important for artists, especially those who don’t necessarily have a regular venue for their work,” said Svetlana Mintcheva, director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), an alliance of more than 50 nonprofits. “But they develop huge audiences on Instagram, and photographic artists more so than others.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pressure campaign worked. Facebook said it would organize a group of artists, educators and activists to talk about its policies. It’s a move that is mirrored in the social network’s broader re-evaluation of its content policies as well as its move to find people outside its corporate borders to help rewrite its rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s a start, but the arts community is not declaring victory just yet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t just want to talk,” Svetlana said. “We’d like to see some action, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruchika Budhraja, a spokesperson for Facebook, said the company was committed to meeting with artists, the NCAC and other stakeholders. “It’s important for us to hear directly from different communities who use Facebook and Instagram,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook’s challenges over where to draw the line with nudity in some ways pre-date the now-prominent debate over its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, underscoring how the company’s rules have shifted drastically, often in one direction and then the other, during its meteoric rise.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Facebook banned pornography early on, its efforts to restrict nudity extended to <a href=""https://www.mic.com/articles/90795/how-women-got-facebook-to-tackle-their-nipple-problem"">pictures of breastfeeding</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/facebook-nude-painting-gustave-courbet"">famous French painting</a> of a nude woman and even <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/these-nipples-got-the-new-yorker-banned-from-facebook-5942284"">a New Yorker cartoon</a>. Though the stakes were lower than years later when the company needed to confront issues like fake news and coordinated foreign manipulation campaigns, many activists took the issue no less seriously.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tenacity of the artist community, even years ago, points to just how central both Facebook and Instagram have become to the daily lives of billions of people as well as to the cultures they participate in. And since Facebook would often delete entire accounts along with their work, artists could spend years building up followings only to see them disappear.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It takes years to build up a base of followers, so this is no small deal for artists working with the body,” said Spencer Tunick, an artist <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2008/01/why-doesn-t-spencer-tunick-get-any-respect.html"">known for his use of nudity</a> — particularly groups of naked people — who helped organize the protest in June. “It’s a major issue as we see it now.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tunick credited artist Micol Hebron with being the first person to <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1088838/women-are-putting-male-nipples-over-their-own-to-call-out-censorship-hypocrisy/"">digitize the male nipple</a> in 2014 and encourage the public to use it to fight censorship on social media. He stressed that he understands why Facebook needs to draw lines, but that there are ways for the company to embrace experimental art while protecting younger users.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook has shown some flexibility. Gabriella Mas Bell, a lawyer with the law firm Polsinelli who has <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol54/iss1/24/"">written about Facebook’s censorship</a> of artistic nudity, said that she would have to constantly update her work because the company’s terms of service frequently changed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I was having to go back and change the language in my article, so you could tell that they were really trying to address it,” Bell said. “So I’m not actually that surprised they’re trying to find a better solution as they’re cracking down on things like hate speech and the abusive language.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For now, however, artists still have to be careful. Spirit said she recently had four pictures deleted from Instagram and knows other artists who were recently banned from the platform for 24 hours for posting some of Tunick’s images.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said she’s hopeful that Facebook could finally make changes. All it took was a few dozen nude people outside one of their offices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We got their attention,” she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology news at NBC News Digital.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

One of the biggest problems with the program — as Sanders noted — was that African-American children were being bused at great lengths to attend white schools. The recent school integration debate focuses more heavily on the battle between public and charter schools and on efforts to desegregate communities as a whole.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The busing issue — which Biden figured prominently in as a senator in the 1970s — came to the forefront after Harris pushed him Thursday to address his position. In that exchange, Harris said Biden worked with segregationist senators ""to oppose busing,"" adding that a local busing program allowed her to attend an integrated school and obtain a good education.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden pushed back, saying she mischaracterized his position ""across the board"" and highlighted his broad support of civil rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I did not oppose busing in America,"" Biden said.

The forum's executive director, Chuck Wexler, said an important takeaway was that police departments and other law enforcement agencies must do a better job of capturing and analyzing police suicide data because ""the research is really uneven.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We advocated that agencies should conduct psychological autopsies on suicides and learn what were the circumstances that resulted in these tragedies,"" Wexler said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We don't even know how many people have attempted suicide,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The danger is amplified for officers who are battling depression and mental health issues because they have easier access to weapons, Wexler said. For some officers, he added, the idea of coming forward about their mental health — then having their firearms confiscated for safety — can only make them less likely to speak up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There's no question that what makes police officers at-risk is because they have an occupational need to have a firearm, and in many of these cases, firearms are the way officers take their lives,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a combustible mixture when you have someone who's dealing with some significant personal issues and the availability of a firearm.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean Powers, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD who retired in 2005, said the fear for some officers is not only that their guns could be taken away, but they would be placed on desk assignment or left monitoring surveillance cameras instead of being out on the beat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""You lose your identity,"" he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, 56, became a volunteer with POPPA, the peer-assistance program, with the desire to help his fellow officers, many struggling with trauma from 9/11. Not long after joining POPPA, he said, he got a call from an officer who was threatening to shoot himself in a quiet parking lot outside of a church on Staten Island. In that case, the officer was helped before he could do any physical harm.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the NYPD and the city of New York provides <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/human-resources-info/employee-assistance-unit.page"" target=""_blank"">internal resources to officers</a>, POPPA offers anonymous counseling services outside of the department. And having a fellow officer to turn to can be advantageous over someone unfamiliar with law enforcement policies, Powers said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Sometimes we get cops who really need to vent, and so you understand the lingo and the jargon. You might not have worked at the same exact precinct or done the same exact job, but you know what they're talking about,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, who also has a sister in the NYPD who volunteers with POPPA, knows he has made a difference when he gets Christmas cards from officers thanking him because they decided not to take their own lives and instead spent another holiday with their families.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After the recent spate of suicides within the NYPD, Powers said, he has reached out to people he knows on the force and asked them to look out for one another.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It's frustrating seeing this happen in your own backyard,"" he added, ""and you think, 'Why didn't he call?'""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>Editor's note: If you are looking for help, please call the <a href=""https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"" target=""_blank"">National Suicide Prevention hotline</a> at 1-800-273-8255.

So, stock your fridge and freezer and get ready for some serious kitchen inspiration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This dish is easy to throw together on a weeknight with everything I always have in my kitchen: boneless, skinless chicken breasts, fennel, onion and canned tomatoes,” says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur <a href=""https://giadzy.com/"" target=""_blank"">Giada De Laurentiis</a>. It’s a lighter — not to mention speedier — take on an Italian classic. “The breadcrumbs are still there for crunch, but by sprinkling them on top, the prep is even easier and cleaner,” explains De Laurentiis.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For another weeknight-friendly chicken dish, De Laurentiis looks to Tuscany. “These chicken breasts are simple yet delicious.” Plus, most of the supporting ingredients are ones you likely have on hand and the recipe takes just 30 minutes from start to finish. Serving the chicken breasts over spinach “adds balance and makes them a complete meal,” notes De Laurentiis. And if you have fresh spinach, feel free to use it in place of the frozen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This quick, deconstructed salad, from Marge Perry and David Bonom’s cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Dinners-Complete-One-Pan-Meals/dp/0062856065/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hero+dinners&amp;qid=1554233181&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">Hero Dinners: Complete One-Pan Meals That Save the Day</a>"" puts a new spin on a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. “Roasting boneless, skinless breasts to temperature results in juicy, tender chicken — and couldn’t be simpler!” insists Perry. “The key is using an instant-read thermometer and cooking the chicken until it is safe but not overcooked and dry: 160°F.” It’s also essential to let the chicken rest. “If you were to slice the chicken right away, the juices would pour out onto the cutting board, which would result in drier, less tender chicken,” explains Perry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Seasoning chicken breasts with a marinade gives them “a whole new life,” says Nik Sharma, the blogger behind <a href=""http://www.abrowntable.com/"" target=""_blank"">A Brown Table</a> and author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Season-Big-Flavors-Beautiful-Food/dp/1452163995/"" target=""_blank"">Season: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food</a>"". Sharma combines buttermilk, lime juice, serrano chiles, scallions, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, cayenne, coriander, cardamom and cumin and recommends marinating for at least four hours and up to eight. His recipe is “a playful take on fried chicken with a big boost of flavors and a great way to introduce curry leaves to folks that are new to it.” If you’re nervous about frying, don’t be. It’s a lot easier to fry small chunks of chicken than whole, bone-in pieces and Sharma has two handy tips: Cut the chicken into equal size pieces so it cooks evenly and watch the temperature of the oil. Otherwise, there’s nothing to it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This speedy supper, from <a href=""https://andrewzimmern.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Zimmern</a>, the James Beard Award-winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""<a href=""https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/bizarre-foods"" target=""_blank"">Bizarre Foods</a>"", pairs grilled chicken with Panzanella, a traditional Italian bread salad. Zimmern seasons boneless, skinless chicken breasts with garlic, parsley and chives and then gently pounds them, so they can be quickly charred over high heat and will “look beautiful on the plate.” Pounding also makes them tender enough for “fork only” eating. Zimmern’s Panzanella features tomato, basil, fennel, and grapefruit, but he encourages you to improvise with what looks good at the farmers’ market.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I love the unique flavors of this dish and that it’s so easy to pull together,” says Cassy Joy Garcia, the blogger behind <a href=""https://fedandfit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fed + Fit</a> and author of the cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628603437"" target=""_blank"">Cook Once, Eat All Week: 26 Weeks of Gluten-Free, Affordable Meal Prep to Preserve Your Time &amp; Sanity</a>"". Boneless, skinless breasts are generously seasoned with a blend of ginger, cumin, garlic, paprika and turmeric then seared in a hot pan. Next, rice is cooked in the same pan, so it picks up all that great Moroccan-inspired flair. Green olives, lemon wedges and chopped fresh cilantro add a little color and brightness to the final dish.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Chicken is really easy to work with,” insists Garcia, who pairs boneless breasts with homemade roasted garlic pesto and prosciutto. “The pesto and prosciutto offer wonderful flavor, bringing chicken from standard to really exciting,” says Garcia. Plus, “it’s an easy protein to prepare in advance, so you can enjoy it for several meals throughout the week.” Garcia recommends pairing the chicken with simple roasted potatoes and a green salad for a complete feast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Boneless, skinless chicken breasts get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless, but that's because most people overcook and under season the protein, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind <a href=""https://domesticate-me.com/"" target=""_blank"">Domesticate Me</a> and author of the upcoming ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dude-Diet-Dinnertime-Weeknight-Fancypants/dp/0062854704/"" target=""_blank"">The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners</a>"". But, if you season the meat well — even just with salt and pepper —and stick to the suggested cooking time, this lean protein can’t be beat. Sliced or diced breast meat is particularly good in stir-fries, because it cooks quickly and absorbs flavor so well, explains Wolf. To guarantee the chicken stays juicy, Wolf cooks it on its own then adds it back to the pan after the other ingredients are ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For her couldn’t-be-simpler Indian Chicken Tikka Bites, Urvashi Pitre, the blogger behind <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Two Sleevers </a>and the author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Fat-Bombs-Sweets-Treats/dp/0358074304"" target=""_blank"">Keto Fat Bombs, Sweet &amp; Treats: Over 100 Recipes and Ideas for Low-Carb Breads, Cakes, Cookies and More</a>"", uses a marinade of yogurt, garlic, ginger and spices to tenderize and flavor the meat. “You can cook the chicken quickly, but still have a tender little mouthful of spicy goodness,” says Pitre. Her other trick is to cook the chicken in ghee, which is clarified butter. It has a higher smoke point than regular butter, so you can use high heat to sear the chicken.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads with followers by a landslide — 17.7 million for him, versus 7.7 million for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 4.4 million for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, 3.6 million for former Vice President Joe Biden and 3.4 million for California Sen. Kamala Harris. (Several candidates have multiple Twitter accounts, so Socially Mined combined their accounts in this analysis.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Going by “engagement rate” on Twitter, a measure that looks at “likes” and “retweets” on the platform, the leader is Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, followed by Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Warren and Biden.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And looking at “mentions” on the platform, again it’s Sanders with a big lead, with more than 4.1 million mentions, compared to 3.5 million for Biden, 3.3 million for Warren, 2.7 million for Harris and 996,000 for Buttigieg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That's a set of numbers that shows a Democratic Party in the mood for change and perhaps ready to move to the left philosophically. Bernie Sanders leads in two categories. Joe Biden leads in none. And Elizabeth Warren is ahead of Biden in two of the three.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When you look at “sentiment” among Twitter users in the Socially Mined data, the trend becomes even clearer.

Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, Warren, Booker, Sanders and Harris all had a higher percentage of “positive” tweets than Biden in June.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rivals-defend-kamala-harris-against-online-attacks-they-compare-birtherism-n1025031"" target=""_blank"">before you let Twitter sort</a> out the Democratic field completely, consider the latest polls of the enormous Democratic field. Most show Biden with a solid lead over his nearest competitor, and some of the margins are well into the double-digit range.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden leads the field by 15 points in the latest USA Today/Suffolk poll. He’s up by 19 in the Politico/Morning Consult poll. And in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Biden leads by 15 points over the field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yes, those numbers were gathered before this week’s debate, where Harris, in particular, had a good showing and Biden did not. But the social media data above was gathered mostly before the debates as well, from June 1 to June 28.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, this is close to an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of the time frame. Nonetheless, the poll numbers don't match up particularly well with the figures from the 280-character ""debate"" appearing on people's smartphone and web browsers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll offered more evidence that Democratic primary voters are more politically moderate than Twitter might suggest. That survey took a deeper look at those who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primary and it did not find an electorate that was running to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That is a split right down the middle between liberal and moderate/conservative voters, 48 percent for each group.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The NBC News/WSJ poll also doesn't seem to reveal the desire for a drastic remaking of the country. Only 16 percent of those surveyed said Democracy in America needs a complete overhaul. Another 41 percent called for major changes and 32 percent said minor changes would suffice. Meanwhile, 10 percent said it was working pretty well as is.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those are numbers that call for change, hardly a surprise for the party that is out of power in Washington and eager to change the occupant of the White House, but not revolution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It's still early, of course. Things can change quickly, particularly as the debates continue and when the votes begin to be cast. But so far there are two Democratic primary races going on in the public eye: A battle that is primarily taking place on the left in the social media world, and a more moderate view in the larger, offline world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the primary fight continues to keep those two visions of the Democratic electorate in mind.

There have also been <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977"">studies</a> linking processed meats to a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes. “The current evidence suggests the higher intake of processed meat, the higher the risk of chronic diseases and mortality,” says <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/frank-hu/"">Frank B. Hu</a>, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Hu notes that while there is no sufficient evidence to suggest a safe amount, eating a small amount of processed meat occasionally (once or twice a month) is unlikely to have an appreciable health impact.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now that we know that the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-better-choice-hot-dog-or-hamburger-ncna864021"" target=""_blank"">occasional hot dog</a> or strip of bacon isn’t cause for concern, what about a more routine processed meat habit? And what about deli turkey? Is that off the hook? How about meats that claim to have no added nitrates? Those can’t be that bad, can they? To answer these pressing questions, we turned to <a href=""mailto:http://pressroom.cancer.org/colleendoyle"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to send email to Colleen Doyle"">Colleen Doyle</a>, MS, RD, Managing Director, Nutrition and Physical Activity at the American Cancer Society.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Processed meat is a meat that has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it through salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, says Doyle. Think: bacon, sausages, hot dogs, canned meat and other cured meats like salami. And that includes deli meat — whether red (like roast beef or ham) or white (like turkey or chicken).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Unfortunately, we just don’t know. “Many studies don’t differentiate between red and white meat consumption in the subjects, so there are still unanswered questions,” Doyle explains.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When it comes to processed meats, consumers are often concerned with added, synthetic nitrates, which are used to preserve the meats and keep them fresher, longer. If you’re concerned about additives, these more natural-sounding meats might seem appealing. But there’s a catch. Doyle explains that these natural meats (including chicken and turkey) are still processed, and they’re still made with nitrates. “They use natural sources of preservatives,” she says. “Many companies are using celery powder, celery juice or celery salt, which are high in nitrates. They can still label their product ‘nitrate-free’, because those are natural and not synthetic, but they are nitrates nonetheless.” In other words, once you ingest deli turkey or chicken or ham made with celery powder or another natural preservative, you’re still consuming nitrates — it’s just in a different form. “Unfortunately, we just don’t know yet whether these have the same impact as synthetic sources of nitrates.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’ve got a lot of bacon-loving friends who ask me this all the time!” says Doyle. Unfortunately, this is another big question mark. “It isn’t known whether there is a safe level of consumption for processed meat — or for unprocessed red meat,” she says. (Unprocessed red meat, like hamburger and steak, has also been linked to health problems.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle understands the popularity of these snacks as they’re approved for many trendy eating patterns (like <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/best-weight-loss-advice-borrow-popular-diets-ncna926246"">paleo</a> and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keto-diet-it-right-you-ncna847256"">keto</a>), and they’re a portable option for people on the go. However, make no mistake. “They’re still processed meats (and tend to be high sodium), so I’d still advise people limit them,” she says. According to Hu, regular consumption of these foods is not considered a healthy dietary choice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle says that while she hasn’t seen studies specifically calling out smoked salmon, it definitely meets the definition of processed. “And, it’s pretty high in sodium. Bottom line for this and all processed meats: It would be smart to eat fish, poultry and beans over red (unprocessed) meat, and for individuals who do consume processed meat products, to do so sparingly, if at all.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If your mind is spinning with this info and your regular lunch routine or <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/healthy-travel-snacks-ncna1021666"" target=""_blank"">on-the-go snack</a> now feels a little less healthy, here are some ideas for replacing processed meats with whole foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Want more tips like these?

24,Scientists are searching for a mirror universe. It could be sitting right in front of you.,25,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/scientists-are-searching-mirror-universe-it-could-be-sitting-right-ncna1023206,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,science,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee, physicist Leah Broussard is trying to open a portal to a parallel universe.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She calls it an “oscillation” that would lead her to “mirror matter,” but the idea is fundamentally the same. In a series of experiments she plans to run at Oak Ridge this summer, Broussard will <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00767"" target=""_blank"">send a beam of subatomic particles down a 50-foot tunnel</a>, past a ring of powerful magnets and into an impenetrable wall. If the setup is just right — and if the universe cooperates — some of those particles will transform into mirror-image versions of themselves, allowing them to tunnel right through the wall. And if that happens, Broussard will have uncovered the first evidence of a mirror world right alongside our own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s pretty wacky,” Broussard says of her mind-bending exploration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The mirror world, assuming it exists, would have its own laws of mirror-physics and its own mirror-history. You wouldn’t find a mirror version of yourself there (and no evil Mister Spock with a goatee — sorry ""Star Trek"" fans). But current theory allows that you might find mirror atoms and mirror rocks, maybe even mirror planets and stars. Collectively, they could form an entire shadow world, just as real as our own but almost completely cut off from us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard says her initial search for the mirror world won’t be especially difficult. “This is a pretty straightforward experiment that we cobbled together with parts we found lying around, using equipment and resources we already had available at Oak Ridge,” she says. But if she unequivocally detects even a single mirror particle, it would prove that the visible universe is only half of what is out there — and that the known laws of physics are only half of a much broader set of rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“If you discover something new like that, the game totally changes,” Broussard says.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As with many grand scientific quests, the hunt for mirror matter <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/"" target=""_blank"">grew out of a small, seemingly esoteric mystery</a>. Starting in the 1990s, physicists developed high-precision experiments to study how neutrons — particles found in the nuclei of atoms — break down into protons, a process related to radioactivity. But those experiments took a strange turn.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers found that neutrons created in particle beams, similar to the one Broussard will use, last 14 minutes and 48 seconds, on average, before “decaying” into protons. But neutrons stored in a laboratory bottle seem to break down a bit faster, in 14 minutes and 38 seconds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ten seconds might not sound like much, but the actual difference should be zero: All neutrons are exactly the same, and their behavior should depend not one bit on where or how they are examined.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I take discrepancy very seriously,” says Benjamin Grinstein, a particle-physics expert at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just between two experiments. It is a collection of many experiments done independently by several groups. The newest experiments, conceived in part to resolve the disagreement, <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627"" target=""_blank"">have “only made it worse,”</a> he adds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Grinstein has explored the possibility that some neutrons are unexpectedly breaking down into particles other than protons but has found nothing so far. Mirror matter offers a more elegant, if somewhat bizarre, explanation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A decade ago, Anatoli Serebrov of Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia introduced the idea that ordinary neutrons sometimes cross over into the mirror world and transform into mirror neutrons. At that point, we could no longer detect them — it would be as if some of the neutrons simply vanished. “That would make the neutron lifetime look wrong,” Broussard explains, because some of the neutrons would have been disappearing from the test equipment while the researchers were studying them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Connect the dots, and you reach a far-out conclusion: The neutron experiments might look screwy because physicists unwittingly opened a portal to the mirror world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard’s goal is to find out if that portal really exists and, if so, to open it in a methodical way. That’s where her neutron beam and impenetrable wall come in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Oak Ridge has an 85-megawatt <a href=""https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir"">nuclear reactor</a> that can shoot out billions of neutrons on demand, so getting enough raw material to work with isn’t an issue. The hard part is figuring out how to make some of the neutrons cross over into the mirror world, and then prove to her skeptical colleagues (and to her skeptical self) that it really happened.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Running the experiment will take about one day. Collecting the data and weeding out every possible source of error might then take a few weeks more. Broussard is looking for any telltale neutrons that managed to get past the barrier by turning into mirror neutrons, then turning back. “It all comes down to: Are we able to shine neutrons through a wall?” she says. “We should see no neutrons” according to conventional physics theory. If some of them show up anyway, that would suggest that conventional physics is wrong, and the mirror world is real.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meanwhile, Klaus Kirch is working on a complementary experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Zurich. His plan is to capture slow-moving neutrons, hit them with a magnetic field and then count to see if all the particles are still there. “If some neutrons oscillated into mirror-neutrons, they would disappear from our apparatus,” he says. Kirch's team has already run the experiment and hopes to have their results analyzed later in the summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite their conceptual simplicity, both Broussard’s and Kirch’s experiments are extremely delicate undertakings, dependent on assessing the strange behavior of a few subatomic particles within a crowd of billions. Other researchers have proposed that there might be more blatant signs of a mirror world. We might be seeing it everywhere in the sky.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the 1970s, astronomers have deduced that the universe is packed full of “<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-dark-matter-ncna871991"">dark matter</a>,” a substance that cannot be observed directly but whose powerful gravitational pull helps keep galaxies from flying apart. The latest analyses indicate that dark matter outweighs visible matter by a factor of five. Yet dozens of intensive searches by astronomers around the world have failed to identify what dark matter is made of.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Zurab Berezhiani, a physicist at the University of L’Aquila in Italy who has conducted his own <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6189-y"">mirror neutron searches</a>, offers an intriguing explanation: Dark matter has been hard to find because it is hidden away in the mirror world. In this view, dark matter and mirror matter are one and the same. If so, the mirror world is not just ubiquitous, it is far more massive than our own. At a recent physics conference, Berezhiani <a href=""http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/17-69W/"">expanded on the idea</a>, outlining a possible parallel reality full of mirror stars, mirror galaxies and mirror black holes. Maybe even dark life?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Dark people is probably a bit farfetched,” says Broussard, who confesses that these ideas push her right to the edge of her comfort zone. “But dark matter is very likely as rich as our own matter. This kind of thing needs to be explored.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If she can open a passage to the mirror world at Oak Ridge, that will be one heck of a start.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

30,"For companies, LGBTQ-inclusive ads weren't always risk-free",31,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/companies-lgbtq-inclusive-ads-weren-t-always-risk-free-n1024971,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,nbc-out,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the U.S. — and many other parts of the world — celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall uprising, rainbow flags and LGBTQ-inclusive ad campaigns appear to be omnipresent, especially in big cities. The ubiquity of these Pride campaigns make it easy to forget that this was not always the case. While many point to corporate America’s embrace of LGBTQ inclusivity as a major sign of progress, others believe corporations are coopting the movement.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Advertisements geared toward gay and lesbian consumers began to appear in earnest in the 1970s, inspired in part by the energy of the Stonewall uprising, which is widely considered the spark that fueled the modern LGBTQ movement.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So-called “sin” products, like alcohol and tobacco, were the first marketed to gays. These companies had little or nothing to lose from a potential boycott by the religious right, according to Katherine Sender, a communications professor at Cornell University and author of “Business, Not Politics: The Making of the Gay Market.”</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f8"">""Now, getting a gay boycott is a much worse thing than getting a boycott from the religious right.""</p>, <p class=""founders-mono f3 lh-title mv0 ttu""><cite class=""fs-normal black"">Professor Katherine Sender</cite><span class=""gray-80""></span></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Absolut vodka was the first brand to build itself with an eye toward the gay market, featuring full-page ads in gay outlets, such as The Advocate. Other alcohol brands like Boodles Gin ran ads in gay publications, but most ad revenue came from local gay bars and businesses.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, with the exception of Absolut, much of the advertising aimed explicitly at gays came to a halt in the 1980s because of the HIV/AIDS crisis and the stigma surrounding the disease.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Things changed in the 1990s. Marketing surveys, namely the 1988 Simmons Market and the 1990 Overlooked Opinions survey, presented an image of gays and lesbians as an affluent, untapped market. Marketers estimated the total annual income of the gay community at over $500 billion. The surveys, however, were not representative and helped to start what researchers have since described as the “myth of gay affluence.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In 1994, Ikea launched the first television ad to feature a gay couple. In the commercial, the two men tease each other about their taste in furniture.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I remember it extremely well, because it was radical,” said Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing. The couple “behaved in every sense like a married couple, and it was radical because it was normal and natural,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Not everyone loved the ad. In fact, the backlash was swift and strong. The American Family Association staged a boycott, and an Ikea store in New York received a bomb threat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That same year, AT&amp;T launched a direct-marketing mail campaign, making them the first US phone company to openly target lesbian and gay customers (MCI ran an earlier campaign, but used suggestive statements and imagery rather than a direct appeal).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“They got a big pushback from the religious right,” Sender said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Companies remained more focused on gay men, though a notable exception was Subaru. In the late ‘90s, Subaru undertook a very successful lesbian-focused marketing campaign after research revealed its sturdy, practical cars appealed to this demographic. “It’s not a choice, it’s the way we’re built,” a 2000 print ad boasted.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This new interest in the “pink dollar” coincided with a massive increase in gay and lesbian visibility in the media. Ellen came out on TV in 1997, which Sender called “a massive deal.” Shows like “The L Word,” “Queer as Folk” and “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” ushered images and information about gays and lesbians into homes across the country.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite the increased visibility and a number of successful ad campaigns, even into the early 2000s mainstream companies still risked a backlash for gay and lesbian inclusivity, according to Sender. Many companies were still afraid to be labeled as selling a “gay product.” Representation of transgender people was almost always negative, relying on transphobic tropes of deceit or mistaken identity, according to Sender’s research.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rich Ferraro, chief communications officer at GLAAD, a national LGBTQ media advocacy organization, has been consulting on LGBTQ images in advertising since 2008. He sees a very different media landscape today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The backlash that once occurred if a brand had LGBTQ marketing campaigns is no longer,” Ferraro wrote in an email. “For instance, fringe organizations like Family Research Council, National Organization for Marriage and One Million Moms would start petitions (which never really reached large numbers), but now they do not.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sender agreed, saying, “Now, getting a gay boycott is a much worse thing than getting a boycott from the religious right.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More and more companies are engaging in LGBTQ-inclusive advertising, Ferraro said. “Categories have exploded — spirits and travel were typically leaders in LGBTQ-inclusive campaigns, but now it’s retail, cars, banking and financial services, food and beverages, youth-oriented brands,” he explained.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Witeck said “there is probably no more efficient way to say we are a contemporary brand” than to make your ad campaigns LGBTQ-inclusive.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For legacy brands, like Coca Cola, they must always be refreshed and made relevant, Witeck added. “LGBTQ marketing is an effective way to say, ‘We get it. We look and talk and act like we are in the 21st century.’”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, Sender said that LGBTQ consumers are not only looking for inclusion in campaigns, but are holding companies accountable in their employment and production practices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Now, people are asking more questions, particularly around transgender polices and health care,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What constitutes the responsibility of the advertising companies is expanding in ways that are really quite powerful,” Sender added, noting that consumers are asking questions like, “Are they buying products or services or in countries that have extremely bad policies and legal enforcement around LGBTQ people?”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Because of their resources, companies are also in a position to exert powerful political influence if they want to. Witeck mentioned the <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/27/bathroom-bill-to-cost-north-carolina-376-billion.html"">corporate boycotts</a> of North Carolina after the passage of HB2 (the so-called “bathroom bill) that helped to precipitate its repeal and major companies’ <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/56-major-companies-respond-to-effort-to-erase-transgender-people-from-legal"">outspoken support</a> for transgender equality.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While historically there has been much less representation of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, this year examples of such campaigns abound:<a href=""https://www.express.com/blog/features/raquel-willis-love-unites""> Raquel Willis for Express</a> on a Times Square billboard,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/dad-shows-transgender-son-how-shave-viral-gillette-ad-n1010891""> Gillette’s commercial</a> featuring a young trans man and his dad, and<a href=""https://www.uber.com/blog/north-america/pride-2019/""> Uber running a campaign</a> featuring trans, genderqueer and bisexual pride flags.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Traditionally, one or two campaigns are inclusive of transgender people, now it is a norm,” Ferraro said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Kristin Comeforo, associate professor of communications at Hartford College, worries that advertisers often take a “check-the-box approach” to the inclusion of gender and racial diversity, rather than a genuine engagement with intersectional experiences.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She also worries that corporate sponsorship can silence the voices of LGBTQ people who face intersectional marginalization.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sender agreed, noting that “the 50th anniversary of Stonewall is such a big deal everyone wants a piece of that.” As a result, she added, Pride marches have become “a party for everybody.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What gets left behind are the very real struggles of LGBTQ people in this country — trans people in particular and people of color facing multiple layers of discrimination,” she added. “This ‘party’ suggests that being gay is just an excuse to have a lovely time, but there is still a long way to go.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">FOLLOW <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out"">NBC OUT</a> ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCOUT"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCOUT/?fref=ts"">FACEBOOK</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nbcout/"">INSTAGRAM</a></p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

But while June has become a month-long celebration for many, it’s apparent that we currently have two different prides occurring.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While rainbows are replacing corporation logos across the nation, Black folks like myself are attending rallies for the death of our trans sisters — most recently <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/activists-demand-justice-for-layleen-polanco-a-black-t-1835379347"">Layleen Polanco Xtranveganza</a>, who was found dead in her jail cell in Rikers Island, and <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trans-women-killed-fairmount-heights"">Zoe Spears</a>, who was shot to death on June 15. Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates.

Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color.

This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Of course you haven’t; I never would either. Except that I have so many times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is another one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Take <a href=""https://www.rawstory.com/2017/10/sci-fi-writer-baffles-abortion-foes-with-simple-question-would-you-save-1000-embryos-or-one-child-in-fire/"" target=""_blank"">this thought experiment by Patrick Tomlinson</a>: “You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled, ‘1000 Viable Human Embryos.’ The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die - saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no C. ‘C’ means you all die.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is a hypothetical ultimately meant to test whether one truly believes that life begins at conception and a human embryo has the same value as the life of a child standing before you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Historically in philosophical inquiries of this kind where, say, the choice is between pulling a lever on a speeding train that would kill one man to avoid a collision that would kill five, <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that 90 percent of people choose to save more people at the expense of one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, I used to think that I was landing a rhetorical deathblow when discussing Tomlinson's scenario and it becomes undeniable that no one can really say in earnest that 1,000 embryos are equal to the life of an actual child when danger looms. And I must admit, I am usually waiting for the victorious moment where I say something like, “Seems like you’re struggling. Do you really believe these embryos are actual kids? If you really did believe that, it wouldn't be that hard of a choice for one kid to burn and you are clearly just a woman-hating-liar-fraud with twisty snakes for brains and cleverly hidden horns. Hahahahaha! I gotcha!""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don’t actually say that, but, in my head, I smile beatifically while ascending onto imaginary stage at a strip mall where to be awarded a medal by the ghosts of famous feminists; I can’t wait for ""pro-lifers” to squirm and repent under the irrefutable mirror I feel I am holding up to their dogmatic moral confusion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s gross to admit, but that’s what I’m doing. I have long since ceased to listen, in any meaningful way, to the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what I realized writing this is that I’ve been telling the story wrong the whole time. The way I have been telling it, there is a grown woman behind the clinic door crying for help, instead of the five-year-old child. I smugly misremembered that’s how the story went and I never checked again. The original thought experiment using the child is much more effective in uncovering where our allegiances lie in terms of where life begins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in this culture war, it was just as easy to imagine it as a choice between a live woman or the embryos. That's how it feels, and that’s how I heard it. Telling it that way forces whomever I am sparring against to admit that their stance on the issue is not complicated at all. They must value the tangible life of an individual adult woman over the ambiguously defined potential in the box. If they don’t, they have a clear disdain for women — even, and especially, if they are one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I have been pitting women against each other with my strident lecturing. I have chosen to believe that it isn't difficult to reconcile this hypothetical choice with their actual religious beliefs or their lived experiences, that they should just know it’s only wrong to leave the woman to the fire. (And it might be, but that’s not the point.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In my quest to protect the autonomy and freedom of women, I have become the ultimate conversation stopper. There is nothing to which I don’t have a counterargument, no silence I can’t fill with more statistics. In my head at these moments, I'm wearing a Katherine Hepburn lawyer-type outfit with <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a20874652/sophie-ratner-1973-necklace-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">a 1973 necklace</a> on to represent Roe v. Wade — trust me, it screams ""very confident."" But these are not the actions of a confident woman.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, truthfully, my rhetoric is the reaction of a throaty wild animal sensing the fire. I can feel the room getting smaller and filling with smoke. I am the woman trapped in the fire. I’m sure that the people that burst in the door will choose the theoretical in the refrigerated box over the real woman pleading and coughing in front of them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">How can I become a better listener if I am this afraid? Can we afford to put down our weapons for a moment in this stand off? Do we do it on the count of three? How can I trust you? Or how can you trust me when I have hijacked the conversation and made you my hostage?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Aspen Baker, founder of the women empowering nonprofit group <a href=""https://exhaleprovoice.org"" target=""_blank"">Exhale</a> created a platform/philosophy called “Pro- Voice” that seeks to bridge this battleground. It has only two tenets: That people should listen and share stories. <a href=""http://www.aspenbaker.com/what-is-pro-voice"" target=""_blank"">Her website says</a>, ""Pro-voice focuses on the all-to-often ignored or exploited personal experiences with abortion."" In a 2015 TED Talk, <a href=""https://blog.ted.com/be-pro-voice-aspen-baker-flips-the-conversation-on-abortion-at-tedwomen-2015/"" target=""_blank"">she expanded on that idea</a>: ""The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic grateful for hers... Personal abortion stories don't fit neatly into one camp or the other.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another organization I love called “<a href=""https://www.aisfor.org/"" target=""_blank"">A is For</a>,"" and it seeks to fund access for all reproductive care and to end the obstructions preventing it. But, they also seek to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by sharing stories. Recently, as more anti-abortion bills were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, Utah, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, A is For gathered and shared the stories of women living in those states, no matter what side of the issue they favored.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sharing stories, and the empathy of real listening might be the only thing that has ever touched a heart or changed a mind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If gentle listening, if really telling and hearing stories could disarm the bomb that begins ticking on this battleground every time the opposing sides meet, why do I still have a secret gun, a detonator in my pocket and a knife in my boot? Because another gross thing to admit is that I’m not ready to do what I espouse. I’d rather show you the other versions of this article that are, in fact, ticking and armed with explosions of my rightness. Just me feeling very right over and over! (And I'm wearing the Katherine Hepburn lawyer- type outfit, duh.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the true story that we need to hear is that <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states"" target=""_blank"">one in four American women will have an abortion by age 45</a> and we need to listen to them — as well as the women who chose differently. Barbara Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer and badass Appalachian woman after my heart <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/now/printable/transcript_kingsolver_print.html"" target=""_blank"">once said</a>, “Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It is the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, even though I am scared and prideful, I am offering to lay down my weapons so that I can listen to the stories — all of them, not just the ones that fit my perspective. Will you join me?

""Be proud of the Flag that you wear.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was reacting to a new viral video in which Rapinoe, asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT/status/1143918087735054336"">months ago</a> whether she would visit the White House if invited by the president, responded casually: “Pfft. I’m not going to the f------ White House.” Rapinoe isn’t alone either — teammates Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger and Becky Sauerbrunn have all shared similar sentiments publicly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Apparently to Trump, this means that Rapinoe and her highly decorated teammates don’t respect their country and aren’t patriotic enough.

They were demanding a living wage so they don’t need second jobs, a calendar of regular games to stay sharp and protections so if players get injured (or pregnant) their careers wouldn’t be stuck in limbo — benefits their male counterparts already enjoyed. Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts.

The statement came during an <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank"">extraordinary last-minute meeting with Kim Jong Un</a>, the North Korean leader.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Side-by-side with Kim in the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to cross the 1953 armistice line separating North and South Korea, then joined Kim for a roughly 50-minute meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was their third since Trump took office, but none have yet yielded a nuclear deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Stepping across that line was a great honor,"" Trump said, later adding that it was ""something incredible.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump deemed the meeting a victory, announcing that nuclear talks would resume ""within weeks"" and that the two countries were designating teams of officials to take the lead.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He even invited Kim, who rarely leaves the country, to visit him at the White House.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet for all the fanfare, there were no signs that the U.S. and the North had made any concrete <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-iran-policy-deepening-mistrust-north-korea-experts-say-n1021901"" target=""_blank"">progress on denuclearization</a>, the issue that has led to North Korea's estrangement from the world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And veteran nuclear negotiators and North Korea experts immediately questioned whether Trump, by staging a high-profile photo-op absent nuclear concessions, was bestowing legitimacy on Kim and undermining global pressure to force the North to accept a denuclearization deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We can only call it historic if it leads to something,"" said Victor Cha, a former Asia director at the White House and an NBC News contributor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The meeting capped an unpredictable three days of diplomacy in which Trump, while in nearby Japan for the G-20 summit of world leaders,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank""> issued an invitation to Kim on Twitter to meet him in the DMZ</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea reacted positively, calling the proposal ""interesting,"" but did not confirm that Kim would accept until the last minute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Even as Trump traveled by helicopter to the DMZ accompanied by a massive security contingent, U.S. officials had told NBC News they were unsure whether Kim would really show up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And when he did, his handshake with Trump and their ensuing talks unfolded in chaotic fashion under overcast skies. Journalists jostled to capture the historic encounter and even White House officials accompanying the president seemed unsure what would happen next.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This means that we can feel at ease,"" Kim said of the meeting through a translator. ""I believe that this will have a positive force on all of our discussions in the future.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a nod to the unforeseen nature of their rendezvous in the DMZ, Kim told Trump that he ""never expected” to see the president “at this place.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed mid-afternoon in the DMZ and rushed to a vista overlooking North Korea. Sean Morrow, commander of the U.N. Security Battalion, briefed Trump about the security situation, gesturing toward North Korean territory.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Minutes later, Trump and Kim were side by side posing for photos and taking a step together over the line into North Korea. They then spoke briefly to reporters inside a nearby room before holding talks that Trump had predicted would last just a few minutes but went on for close to an hour.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both leaders predicted it would lead to better things to become between their two countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Of striking a nuclear deal, Trump said: ""We're not looking for speed, we're looking to get it right.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was already the first U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader while in office, having met with Kim twice before. This marks the first meeting in the no-man’s-land between North and South since the end of the Korean War.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-begins-one-one-kim-jong-un-tempering-expectations-n977466"" target=""_blank"">Trump’s last summit with Kim — in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February — collapsed abruptly</a>, with a planned signing ceremony scrapped and Trump explaining to reporters that “sometimes you have to walk.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the center of that failure, U.S. officials have said, was Kim’s insistence that all nuclear sanctions be lifted in exchange for only some concessions sought by the U.S. from Pyongyang related to its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But a senior Trump administration official told NBC News ahead of the meeting Sunday that the administration was hoping that even a handshake might jump-start negotiations at a lower level led by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those talks could then focus on making more substantive progress on the nuclear issues.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Trump said after the meeting that Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be handling the relaunched nuclear talks between the countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And while Trump said that sanctions on the North would remain in place for now, he seemed to leave open the possibility that some could be removed during the talks, a shift from the longstanding U.S. position that all sanctions remain in place until a denuclearization deal is struck.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""At some point during the negotiation, things can happen,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">National security hawks and many of Trump’s critics have warned that such meetings plays into Kim's hands, boosting him domestically and providing room for Pyongyang to continue to stall while it moves ahead with its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads and the ability to mount them on missiles, but has yet to prove it can deliver those nuclear-tipped missiles successfully to distances as remote as the U.S. mainland.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet Trump projected no sense of urgency on Sunday as he argued there was plenty of time to reach a deal with North Korea, echoing an argument he'd made about resolving the Iran nuclear issue the day before.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’m never in a rush,” Trump said. “If you’re in a rush, you get yourself in trouble.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both Trump and Kim offered invitations to the other to visit their capitals, with Trump saying, ""I’ll invite him to the White House right now.” Kim said it would be a “great honor” if Trump visited Pyongyang.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Neither of those are likely to occur in the short term given the immense logistical and security challenges of arranging such a visit between countries that do not have diplomatic relations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet as he talked up his own diplomatic achievements, Trump took significant liberties with history.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said inaccurately that former President Barack Obama had wanted to meet with Kim but been rejected. He also claimed that tensions with the North had dissipated as soon as he took office, when in fact Trump engaged in a war of words with the North — including his threat to unleash “fire and fury” — that caused significant alarm across Asia and beyond.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ve had peace for two and a half years,"" Trump said Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president also glossed over reports that <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-carrying-out-purge-after-n1012251"" target=""_blank"">Kim had ordered some of his negotiators executed</a> following the failed Hanoi summit. Asked whether they were still alive, Trump said ""I think they are,"" adding that the main person the U.S. was familiar with was still living.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I would hope the rest are too,"" Trump said. ""I would really hope the rest are too. ""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier, standing with Moon at the Blue House, South Korea’s equivalent of the White House, Trump said that he and Kim “understand each other, I do believe.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that both he and Kim wanted to hold the meeting “from the beginning.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“He understands me, and I believe I maybe understand him,” Trump said. “Sometimes that can lead to very good things.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moon, a liberal in South Korea’s political world who has pushed hard for more engagement with the North, had said ahead of the Trump-Kim meeting that he planned to let the two leaders meet privately, saying that ""as for an inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen a later time.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea, after all, had publicly admonished South Korea for trying to mediate between it and the U.S.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in the end, Moon did join the U.S. and North Korean leaders for part of their meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has played an unusual role in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy, wrote on Twitter that he was wishing ""my friends"" Trump and Kim ""a very good meeting.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Much love to you both and keep up the wonderful progress!""

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>, <p>Don't miss out.

Then he called it a ""great honor"" to be with Putin, praising their ""very, very good relationship"" and predicting ""a lot of very positive things"" would result.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As reporters shouted questions and cameras clicked, Trump cocked his head when asked by NBC News whether he would tell Putin not to interfere in the vote next year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The answer to the question is, of course I will. 'Don’t meddle in the election,'"" Trump said. As Putin smiled broadly, Trump briefly raised his finger toward Putin before turning away and repeating: ""Don’t meddle in the election.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over the din in the meeting room, it was unclear whether Trump had initially said, ""Don't meddle in the election, please,"" or ""Don't meddle in the election, president."" Journalists in the room and watching video of the exchange heard him say ""please,"" but a White House transcript later maintained that Trump had said ""president.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Either way, Trump’s casual comments to Putin were unlikely to satisfy his critics, who have lambasted him for <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-discussed-mueller-report-agreed-no-collusion-white-house-n1001706"" target=""_blank"">repeatedly casting doubt</a> on whether Russia interfered in 2016 despite the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/information-warfare-how-russians-interfered-2016-election-n848746"" target=""_blank"">firm assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies </a>and former<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/video/what-s-next-in-the-mueller-probe-1446044739569"" target=""_blank""> special counsel Robert Mueller</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump continues to dismiss the Mueller probe as a ""witch hunt,"" and Putin says he agrees.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/878d2344-98f0-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times interview</a> just ahead of the G-20, Putin brushed off ""mythical"" Russian interference and argued that Trump really won the election because he ""looked into his opponents’ attitude to him and saw changes in American society, and he took advantage of it.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">With the Mueller investigation complete, Trump and Putin are entering a new period in which the years-long probe no longer hangs over them, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-russia-china-plotting-interfere-2020-election-n963896"" target=""_blank"">although Congress continues to investigate</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Offering an outstretched hand to Trump, the Russian leader invited him next May to attend Moscow's massive annual World War II victory parade, which most global leaders have traditionally shunned. The Kremlin told Russian media that Trump has ""reacted positively to the invitation,"" although a White House official would say only that while Trump supports commemorating Allied troops who died in the war, ""he has not confirmed participation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In recent weeks, Trump has renewed concerns about his seriousness in confronting Russia’s efforts to interfere in U.S. democracy by <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/i-think-i-d-take-it-trump-says-he-d-n1017031"" target=""_blank"">saying he would listen to damaging information</a> offered from foreign governments about one of his political opponents.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Amid the ensuing uproar, Trump shifted position and argued that he would also tell the FBI.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump's playful approach to broaching the election issue with Putin stood in sharp contrast to outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, who chided Putin for ""hostile interventions in other countries, disinformation and cyberattacks, which undermine Russia’s standing in the world,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. In her meeting with Putin at the G-20, May also confronted the Russian president on Moscow's actions in Ukraine, LGBT rights and what she called ""irrefutable evidence"" that Russia used a chemical weapon on British soil.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Trump's meeting with Putin got underway, he told reporters they would be discussing trade, disarmament and “a little protectionism, perhaps.” The White House later said they had discussed Iran, Syria and Ukraine and had agreed “that improved relations between the United States and Russia was in each countries’ mutual interest and the interest of the world.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Putin, for his part, said the two leaders had much to discuss in Osaka, noting that they had not seen each other since the Helsinki summit. Still, he said through a translator that their teams had been working together in the interim and said their session in Osaka would be “a great opportunity to follow up on that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two sat side to side in front of Russian and American flags, flanked by their delegation. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump’s senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Accompanying Putin were Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other Russian officials.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A White House description of the meeting later said Trump had told Putin that “a 21st century model of arms control” must include China. It was a reference to the New START nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, set to expire in 2021, and the Trump administration’s desire that any renewal of the agreement also include China, which is not currently bound by the treaty.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meeting later in the day with the Brazilian leader, Trump told reporters he and Putin had discussed ""a lot of things"" — including Venezuela, where Russia is supporting embattled President Nicolás Maduro while the United States has recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ll have to see what happens with Venezuela,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Josh Lederman is a national political reporter for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Kristen Welker is a White House correspondent for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Hans Nichols is NBC News' Pentagon correspondent. </p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Even though she was on her family’s health insurance at the time, she said she had to pay <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/u-s-insulin-costs-patient-nearly-doubled-2012-2016-study-n961296"" target=""_blank"">hundreds of dollars every month for her insulin</a>, which was necessary for her survival.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But when the Chicago native moved to Germany, Reich said she was shocked to learn both her insulin and insulin pump were totally covered — no out-of-pocket expenses.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As a student at a public university in Germany, I automatically qualified for the public health care system,” Reich said. “I was really surprised that everything necessary to take care of my diabetes was covered, 100 percent.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Reich said she couldn’t help feeling like a drain on the country’s system, and expressed those feelings to her German friends.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">They reassured her they simply viewed health care differently.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s about having a safety net, because tomorrow you don’t know what could happen,” Reich told NBC News.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Six years later — still living in Germany — Reich has embraced the idea of a safety net.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I don’t need to worry about crazy stuff coming up month to month. I’d rather be paying a steady fee and knowing I’m safe,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Germany has what's called a universal multi-payer health care system. It encompasses both statutory health insurance for people who earn less than a certain salary, as well as private health insurance for those who earn more and choose to purchase their own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Employers and their employees pay for most of the health care system in Germany through premiums. All workers contribute about 7.5 percent of their salary into a public health insurance pool. Employers match that 7.5 percent contribution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This “all for one and one for all” approach to health care has roots in the Middle Ages, when German craftsmen paid into one fund that was used to help any of its members in case someone became ill or suffered financial hardship.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ideology lives on in the modern German system. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We are one big community,” said Dr. Henning Baberg, a cardiologist and the medical director of Helios Hospital Berlin-Buch. “The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“But they all get the same treatment,” he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg likens the difference between statutory and private health insurance in Germany to the difference between economy and business class on a commercial airline flight.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Same flight, same plane, same safety profile.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the system imposes strict limits on out-of-pocket costs, greatly reducing the number of <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/surprise-medical-bills-lead-liens-homes-crippling-debt-n984371"" target=""_blank"">surprise medical bills</a>. The maximum copay for prescription medications is about $10 or $11.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Helene and Michael Sula, both originally from Dallas, are also expatriates like Reich. Unlike Reich, however, they pay for private health insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Sulas chose to live in Germany for its central European location, and were taking advantage of the country’s proximity to the Austrian Alps when Helene tore her anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, while skiing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When I fell, I didn’t think it was that bad,” Helene Sula, 32, recalled. “It wasn’t until a man came up to me and said, ‘We’re going to need to turn your leg back the other way’ that I realized something bad had occurred.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The couple said Helene Sula was lucky to find a doctor who could do an MRI quickly once back in Germany; most places they called were booked for weeks — a common disadvantage for elective procedures. They credited their private health insurance not only with getting a swift diagnosis, but also insisting on having the best surgeon available to do the operation necessary to repair her injured knee.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There’s a price difference, of course, but it’s your knee, so we thought we’d spend a little extra cash to get the best doctor available,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The cost for everything related to Helene Sula’s <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cool-new-knee-procedure-eases-arthritis-pain-without-surgery-n771221"" target=""_blank"">knee surgery</a> was about $2,000, compared with $14,000 for the same treatment in America.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite some language barriers, the Sulas said the German health care system was easy to navigate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s much easier to pay your bills and understand your coverage than in America, where you’re sort of left to figure it out on your own,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Health care industry experts in the United States say the German system is a good example of an employer-based model of medical insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“No one pays more than two percent of their family income for out-of-pocket health care costs” in Germany, said Robin Osborn, director of the International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program at The Commonwealth Fund.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And if you’re sick, if you’re chronically ill, it’s one percent. No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But Osborn does not recommend the U.S. copy Germany’s or any other country’s health care system and adopt it here.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s important to remember that we do have outstanding health care in the United States. We have pockets of excellence. We have integrated delivery systems that are the envy of the world,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s just that not everyone gets that outstanding health care. It doesn’t exist uniformly across the country,” she added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg, who received medical training at the University of California, San Diego, said one advantage the U.S. health care system has is transparency. Although Germans can go to any hospital they want, it’s more difficult for them to find data on quality outcomes for individual facilities.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But, he added, the U.S. health care system is flawed in a different way: Americans with less money get less health care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“That’s wrong,” Baberg said. “That’s not humanity.

The flowering evergreens that can tower to 85 feet comprise 80 percent of the state’s canopy, covering 1 million acres, and its nectar sustains birds and insects found nowhere else on Earth.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now, public agencies and private citizens are trying to avoid biological and economic catastrophe by proclaiming war against a deadly fungal disease coined “rapid ʻōhiʻa death,” or ROD, that is swiftly destroying the trees. What’s more, invasive species like the miconia tree, native to North and South America and called the “green cancer” of Hawaii’s forests, are choking out the ʻōhiʻa.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The disappearance of these trees would have a major impact on Hawaii,” said Clyde Imada, a botanical research specialist at the <a href=""http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/waipio/index.html"">Bishop Museum</a> of natural and cultural history in Honolulu. “Recreationally, outdoor forest experiences in natural areas will be significantly altered.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Birds, insects and plants will be direly affected,"" he continued. ""The ‘ōhi‘a forest experience can’t be re-created with substitute species.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More than 2 million ʻōhiʻa trees have been killed by ROD, according to the U.S. Forest Service, and about <a href=""https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/rod/THE-DISEASE"">135,000 acres</a> show symptoms of the disease that was first identified on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, in 2014. Two years later, the state <a href=""https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/blog/main/nr-ohiaquarantine/"">imposed a quarantine</a> to prevent ROD from spreading to other islands. It didn’t work. The <a href=""https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/12/22/fungus-behind-rapid-ohia-death-is-spreading-kauai/"">most aggressive form of the fungus was found on Kauai</a> late last year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Manakō Tanaka, a Hawaiian culture expert at the Oahu Visitors Bureau, said the ʻōhiʻalehua tree and its blossoms have always been ""the first to sprout up after lava flows that wipe forests out.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And so it’s become synonymous with the bravest of warriors who were the strongest and first into battle.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tree is also associated with Laka, the goddess of hula, its flower used in leis for the traditional Hawaiian dance. <a href=""https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/03/31/hawaii-news/ohia-lehua-blight-takes-toll-on-hula-competition/"">In 2016, for the first time in more than 50 years, </a>many hula schools were forced to forgo their adornments because of diminishing ʻōhiʻa stock.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It would be heartbreaking to only be able to show pictures of the tree and its flowers to future generations,” Tanaka said. “Losing the ʻōhiʻa lehua would be like losing a reference encyclopedia into the past.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Experts believe the fungus may have been carried to the islands by unwitting tourists, perhaps on their shoes or hiking boots. It can also be transmitted by dirty tools, woodland animals or the wind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is speculation visitors are responsible for bringing this disease to Hawaii Island,” said Sam Gon, senior scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. “Either because they were uninformed or uncaring about the need to sanitize their gear. ROD could have a devastating effect on our environment and economy, and we need to reform tourism practices among visitors.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The federal government has attempted to stop the fungus and tackle invasive species by imposing a quarantine on Hawaii Island and carrying out extensive tests to learn how the fungus spreads, but it has yet to find a solution. Hawaiian organizations, communities and scientists are now stepping in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gunstock Ranch, a horse riding stable and tourist destination on Oahu, is replanting native trees, although not the ʻōhi‘a yet. After conducting a survey on 80 acres of its land in 2016, and finding just two native species, owner Greg Smith established a Hawaiian <a href=""https://gunstockranch.com/hawaiian-legacy-forest/"">“legacy forest,”</a> where visitors can plant trees and monitor their growth online.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Our hope is that as our guests plant and dedicate a tree they will form a new connection to the land and Hawaii and leave knowing that they made a difference,” Smith said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some tourism companies are sending staff members to workshops to learn how to protect native species through improved biological sanitation practices. Joshua Nipp, founder of <a href=""https://www.offthebeatenpath.com/"">Off the Beaten Path</a> travel company, hopes to establish a bio-sanitation certification program for tour operators.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A coalition of state agencies called the <a href=""https://www.cgaps.org/why-should-we-care/"">Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species</a> is pushing for stronger regulations and tracking of biological products entering Hawaii.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tanaka said tourists can play an important role in staving off ROD, particularly on islands like Oahu, which has not yet been infected with the fungus. He said they should always make sure their shoes are clean and free of debris and seeds, and he urged visitors to stay away from areas marked off-limits to protect delicate ecosystems.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is a proverb in Hawaiian, ‘I aliʻi ka ‘āina, i kauā ke kanaka.’ It means, ‘The land is chief, and men are its stewards,’” Tanaka said. “Sometimes, though, I fear that we may be moving to a world where people think it is the other way around.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Complaints and protests from artists and arts organizations in real life and on social media, including at least <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity"">one that went viral</a>, made little progress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I started to decide that it just comes with the territory,” Spirit said of Facebook’s bans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But arts organizations kept at it. In early June, 125 people protested in the nude outside the New York City headquarters of Facebook and Instagram, covering themselves with stickers of photographed male nipples in protest of the long-argued double standard that only female nipples are against the company’s policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The artists’ action speaks to just how important the platforms, especially Instagram, have become to the arts now that Tumblr — once a haven for artists — <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tumblr-ban-all-adult-content-n943226"">does not allow any adult content</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Instagram has been so important for artists, especially those who don’t necessarily have a regular venue for their work,” said Svetlana Mintcheva, director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), an alliance of more than 50 nonprofits. “But they develop huge audiences on Instagram, and photographic artists more so than others.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pressure campaign worked. Facebook said it would organize a group of artists, educators and activists to talk about its policies. It’s a move that is mirrored in the social network’s broader re-evaluation of its content policies as well as its move to find people outside its corporate borders to help rewrite its rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s a start, but the arts community is not declaring victory just yet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t just want to talk,” Svetlana said. “We’d like to see some action, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruchika Budhraja, a spokesperson for Facebook, said the company was committed to meeting with artists, the NCAC and other stakeholders. “It’s important for us to hear directly from different communities who use Facebook and Instagram,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook’s challenges over where to draw the line with nudity in some ways pre-date the now-prominent debate over its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, underscoring how the company’s rules have shifted drastically, often in one direction and then the other, during its meteoric rise.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Facebook banned pornography early on, its efforts to restrict nudity extended to <a href=""https://www.mic.com/articles/90795/how-women-got-facebook-to-tackle-their-nipple-problem"">pictures of breastfeeding</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/facebook-nude-painting-gustave-courbet"">famous French painting</a> of a nude woman and even <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/these-nipples-got-the-new-yorker-banned-from-facebook-5942284"">a New Yorker cartoon</a>. Though the stakes were lower than years later when the company needed to confront issues like fake news and coordinated foreign manipulation campaigns, many activists took the issue no less seriously.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tenacity of the artist community, even years ago, points to just how central both Facebook and Instagram have become to the daily lives of billions of people as well as to the cultures they participate in. And since Facebook would often delete entire accounts along with their work, artists could spend years building up followings only to see them disappear.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It takes years to build up a base of followers, so this is no small deal for artists working with the body,” said Spencer Tunick, an artist <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2008/01/why-doesn-t-spencer-tunick-get-any-respect.html"">known for his use of nudity</a> — particularly groups of naked people — who helped organize the protest in June. “It’s a major issue as we see it now.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tunick credited artist Micol Hebron with being the first person to <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1088838/women-are-putting-male-nipples-over-their-own-to-call-out-censorship-hypocrisy/"">digitize the male nipple</a> in 2014 and encourage the public to use it to fight censorship on social media. He stressed that he understands why Facebook needs to draw lines, but that there are ways for the company to embrace experimental art while protecting younger users.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook has shown some flexibility. Gabriella Mas Bell, a lawyer with the law firm Polsinelli who has <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol54/iss1/24/"">written about Facebook’s censorship</a> of artistic nudity, said that she would have to constantly update her work because the company’s terms of service frequently changed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I was having to go back and change the language in my article, so you could tell that they were really trying to address it,” Bell said. “So I’m not actually that surprised they’re trying to find a better solution as they’re cracking down on things like hate speech and the abusive language.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For now, however, artists still have to be careful. Spirit said she recently had four pictures deleted from Instagram and knows other artists who were recently banned from the platform for 24 hours for posting some of Tunick’s images.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said she’s hopeful that Facebook could finally make changes. All it took was a few dozen nude people outside one of their offices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We got their attention,” she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology news at NBC News Digital.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

""We need to make sure kids go to community schools which are integrated, and that means we have to focus on fair housing legislation and enforcement.

One of the biggest problems with the program — as Sanders noted — was that African-American children were being bused at great lengths to attend white schools. The recent school integration debate focuses more heavily on the battle between public and charter schools and on efforts to desegregate communities as a whole.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The busing issue — which Biden figured prominently in as a senator in the 1970s — came to the forefront after Harris pushed him Thursday to address his position. In that exchange, Harris said Biden worked with segregationist senators ""to oppose busing,"" adding that a local busing program allowed her to attend an integrated school and obtain a good education.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden pushed back, saying she mischaracterized his position ""across the board"" and highlighted his broad support of civil rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I did not oppose busing in America,"" Biden said. ""What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">To many, Biden's explanation sounded a lot like the ""states rights"" defense that opponents to civil rights enforcement have cited for decades.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sen.

The forum's executive director, Chuck Wexler, said an important takeaway was that police departments and other law enforcement agencies must do a better job of capturing and analyzing police suicide data because ""the research is really uneven.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We advocated that agencies should conduct psychological autopsies on suicides and learn what were the circumstances that resulted in these tragedies,"" Wexler said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We don't even know how many people have attempted suicide,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The danger is amplified for officers who are battling depression and mental health issues because they have easier access to weapons, Wexler said. For some officers, he added, the idea of coming forward about their mental health — then having their firearms confiscated for safety — can only make them less likely to speak up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There's no question that what makes police officers at-risk is because they have an occupational need to have a firearm, and in many of these cases, firearms are the way officers take their lives,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a combustible mixture when you have someone who's dealing with some significant personal issues and the availability of a firearm.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean Powers, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD who retired in 2005, said the fear for some officers is not only that their guns could be taken away, but they would be placed on desk assignment or left monitoring surveillance cameras instead of being out on the beat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""You lose your identity,"" he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, 56, became a volunteer with POPPA, the peer-assistance program, with the desire to help his fellow officers, many struggling with trauma from 9/11. Not long after joining POPPA, he said, he got a call from an officer who was threatening to shoot himself in a quiet parking lot outside of a church on Staten Island. In that case, the officer was helped before he could do any physical harm.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the NYPD and the city of New York provides <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/human-resources-info/employee-assistance-unit.page"" target=""_blank"">internal resources to officers</a>, POPPA offers anonymous counseling services outside of the department.

This supermarket staple is simple to cook and can be prepped in such a wide variety of ways, that it’s probably always on your weekly shopping list. You just know you’re going to use it and even if you don’t, chicken can easily be frozen for future meals. In fact, do your budget a favor and pick up a value pack of breasts to freeze in individual or family-size portions, so you always have a wallet-friendly dinner at the ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No doubt you have a <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/easy-delicious-chicken-dinners-make-every-night-next-week-ncna900946"" target=""_blank"">few favorite chicken recipes</a> in your back pocket, but considering the ease, affordability and versatility of boneless breasts, why not mix up your repertoire with a few fresh ideas? Here, chefs and food experts, including Giada De Laurentiis, Andrew Zimmern, Urvashi Pitre, Cassy Joy Garcia, Serena Wolf, Nik Sharma, Marge Perry and David Bonom share the chicken dishes they make over and over again. Their recipes show just how much you can do with simple chicken breasts, including <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/10-healthy-recipes-your-memorial-day-barbecue-ncna763546"" target=""_blank"">grilling</a>, roasting and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/diy-chinese-takeout-recipe-sesame-chicken-cauliflower-fried-rice-ncna1005141"" target=""_blank"">stir-frying</a>, plus how well this lean protein takes to different flavors. So, stock your fridge and freezer and get ready for some serious kitchen inspiration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This dish is easy to throw together on a weeknight with everything I always have in my kitchen: boneless, skinless chicken breasts, fennel, onion and canned tomatoes,” says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur <a href=""https://giadzy.com/"" target=""_blank"">Giada De Laurentiis</a>. It’s a lighter — not to mention speedier — take on an Italian classic. “The breadcrumbs are still there for crunch, but by sprinkling them on top, the prep is even easier and cleaner,” explains De Laurentiis.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For another weeknight-friendly chicken dish, De Laurentiis looks to Tuscany. “These chicken breasts are simple yet delicious.” Plus, most of the supporting ingredients are ones you likely have on hand and the recipe takes just 30 minutes from start to finish. Serving the chicken breasts over spinach “adds balance and makes them a complete meal,” notes De Laurentiis. And if you have fresh spinach, feel free to use it in place of the frozen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This quick, deconstructed salad, from Marge Perry and David Bonom’s cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Dinners-Complete-One-Pan-Meals/dp/0062856065/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hero+dinners&amp;qid=1554233181&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">Hero Dinners: Complete One-Pan Meals That Save the Day</a>"" puts a new spin on a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. “Roasting boneless, skinless breasts to temperature results in juicy, tender chicken — and couldn’t be simpler!” insists Perry. “The key is using an instant-read thermometer and cooking the chicken until it is safe but not overcooked and dry: 160°F.” It’s also essential to let the chicken rest. “If you were to slice the chicken right away, the juices would pour out onto the cutting board, which would result in drier, less tender chicken,” explains Perry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Seasoning chicken breasts with a marinade gives them “a whole new life,” says Nik Sharma, the blogger behind <a href=""http://www.abrowntable.com/"" target=""_blank"">A Brown Table</a> and author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Season-Big-Flavors-Beautiful-Food/dp/1452163995/"" target=""_blank"">Season: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food</a>"". Sharma combines buttermilk, lime juice, serrano chiles, scallions, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, cayenne, coriander, cardamom and cumin and recommends marinating for at least four hours and up to eight. His recipe is “a playful take on fried chicken with a big boost of flavors and a great way to introduce curry leaves to folks that are new to it.” If you’re nervous about frying, don’t be. It’s a lot easier to fry small chunks of chicken than whole, bone-in pieces and Sharma has two handy tips: Cut the chicken into equal size pieces so it cooks evenly and watch the temperature of the oil. Otherwise, there’s nothing to it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This speedy supper, from <a href=""https://andrewzimmern.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Zimmern</a>, the James Beard Award-winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""<a href=""https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/bizarre-foods"" target=""_blank"">Bizarre Foods</a>"", pairs grilled chicken with Panzanella, a traditional Italian bread salad. Zimmern seasons boneless, skinless chicken breasts with garlic, parsley and chives and then gently pounds them, so they can be quickly charred over high heat and will “look beautiful on the plate.” Pounding also makes them tender enough for “fork only” eating. Zimmern’s Panzanella features tomato, basil, fennel, and grapefruit, but he encourages you to improvise with what looks good at the farmers’ market.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I love the unique flavors of this dish and that it’s so easy to pull together,” says Cassy Joy Garcia, the blogger behind <a href=""https://fedandfit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fed + Fit</a> and author of the cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628603437"" target=""_blank"">Cook Once, Eat All Week: 26 Weeks of Gluten-Free, Affordable Meal Prep to Preserve Your Time &amp; Sanity</a>"". Boneless, skinless breasts are generously seasoned with a blend of ginger, cumin, garlic, paprika and turmeric then seared in a hot pan. Next, rice is cooked in the same pan, so it picks up all that great Moroccan-inspired flair. Green olives, lemon wedges and chopped fresh cilantro add a little color and brightness to the final dish.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Chicken is really easy to work with,” insists Garcia, who pairs boneless breasts with homemade roasted garlic pesto and prosciutto. “The pesto and prosciutto offer wonderful flavor, bringing chicken from standard to really exciting,” says Garcia. Plus, “it’s an easy protein to prepare in advance, so you can enjoy it for several meals throughout the week.” Garcia recommends pairing the chicken with simple roasted potatoes and a green salad for a complete feast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Boneless, skinless chicken breasts get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless, but that's because most people overcook and under season the protein, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind <a href=""https://domesticate-me.com/"" target=""_blank"">Domesticate Me</a> and author of the upcoming ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dude-Diet-Dinnertime-Weeknight-Fancypants/dp/0062854704/"" target=""_blank"">The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners</a>"". But, if you season the meat well — even just with salt and pepper —and stick to the suggested cooking time, this lean protein can’t be beat. Sliced or diced breast meat is particularly good in stir-fries, because it cooks quickly and absorbs flavor so well, explains Wolf. To guarantee the chicken stays juicy, Wolf cooks it on its own then adds it back to the pan after the other ingredients are ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For her couldn’t-be-simpler Indian Chicken Tikka Bites, Urvashi Pitre, the blogger behind <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Two Sleevers </a>and the author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Fat-Bombs-Sweets-Treats/dp/0358074304"" target=""_blank"">Keto Fat Bombs, Sweet &amp; Treats: Over 100 Recipes and Ideas for Low-Carb Breads, Cakes, Cookies and More</a>"", uses a marinade of yogurt, garlic, ginger and spices to tenderize and flavor the meat. “You can cook the chicken quickly, but still have a tender little mouthful of spicy goodness,” says Pitre. Her other trick is to cook the chicken in ghee, which is clarified butter. It has a higher smoke point than regular butter, so you can use high heat to sear the chicken. Ghee can be purchased at many supermarkets, or you can make your own in less than 20 minutes with Pitre’s <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/homemade-ghee/"" target=""_blank"">easy recipe</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/12-french-fry-recipes-won-t-kill-you-ncna771896"">Want more tips like these?

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads with followers by a landslide — 17.7 million for him, versus 7.7 million for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 4.4 million for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, 3.6 million for former Vice President Joe Biden and 3.4 million for California Sen. Kamala Harris. (Several candidates have multiple Twitter accounts, so Socially Mined combined their accounts in this analysis.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Going by “engagement rate” on Twitter, a measure that looks at “likes” and “retweets” on the platform, the leader is Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, followed by Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Warren and Biden.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And looking at “mentions” on the platform, again it’s Sanders with a big lead, with more than 4.1 million mentions, compared to 3.5 million for Biden, 3.3 million for Warren, 2.7 million for Harris and 996,000 for Buttigieg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That's a set of numbers that shows a Democratic Party in the mood for change and perhaps ready to move to the left philosophically. Bernie Sanders leads in two categories. Joe Biden leads in none. And Elizabeth Warren is ahead of Biden in two of the three.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When you look at “sentiment” among Twitter users in the Socially Mined data, the trend becomes even clearer. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, Warren, Booker, Sanders and Harris all had a higher percentage of “positive” tweets than Biden in June.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rivals-defend-kamala-harris-against-online-attacks-they-compare-birtherism-n1025031"" target=""_blank"">before you let Twitter sort</a> out the Democratic field completely, consider the latest polls of the enormous Democratic field. Most show Biden with a solid lead over his nearest competitor, and some of the margins are well into the double-digit range.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden leads the field by 15 points in the latest USA Today/Suffolk poll. He’s up by 19 in the Politico/Morning Consult poll. And in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Biden leads by 15 points over the field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yes, those numbers were gathered before this week’s debate, where Harris, in particular, had a good showing and Biden did not. But the social media data above was gathered mostly before the debates as well, from June 1 to June 28.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, this is close to an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of the time frame. Nonetheless, the poll numbers don't match up particularly well with the figures from the 280-character ""debate"" appearing on people's smartphone and web browsers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll offered more evidence that Democratic primary voters are more politically moderate than Twitter might suggest. That survey took a deeper look at those who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primary and it did not find an electorate that was running to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That is a split right down the middle between liberal and moderate/conservative voters, 48 percent for each group.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The NBC News/WSJ poll also doesn't seem to reveal the desire for a drastic remaking of the country. Only 16 percent of those surveyed said Democracy in America needs a complete overhaul. Another 41 percent called for major changes and 32 percent said minor changes would suffice. Meanwhile, 10 percent said it was working pretty well as is.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those are numbers that call for change, hardly a surprise for the party that is out of power in Washington and eager to change the occupant of the White House, but not revolution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It's still early, of course. Things can change quickly, particularly as the debates continue and when the votes begin to be cast. But so far there are two Democratic primary races going on in the public eye: A battle that is primarily taking place on the left in the social media world, and a more moderate view in the larger, offline world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the primary fight continues to keep those two visions of the Democratic electorate in mind.

There have also been <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977"">studies</a> linking processed meats to a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes. “The current evidence suggests the higher intake of processed meat, the higher the risk of chronic diseases and mortality,” says <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/frank-hu/"">Frank B. Hu</a>, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Hu notes that while there is no sufficient evidence to suggest a safe amount, eating a small amount of processed meat occasionally (once or twice a month) is unlikely to have an appreciable health impact.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now that we know that the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-better-choice-hot-dog-or-hamburger-ncna864021"" target=""_blank"">occasional hot dog</a> or strip of bacon isn’t cause for concern, what about a more routine processed meat habit? And what about deli turkey? Is that off the hook? How about meats that claim to have no added nitrates? Those can’t be that bad, can they? To answer these pressing questions, we turned to <a href=""mailto:http://pressroom.cancer.org/colleendoyle"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to send email to Colleen Doyle"">Colleen Doyle</a>, MS, RD, Managing Director, Nutrition and Physical Activity at the American Cancer Society.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Processed meat is a meat that has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it through salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, says Doyle. Think: bacon, sausages, hot dogs, canned meat and other cured meats like salami. And that includes deli meat — whether red (like roast beef or ham) or white (like turkey or chicken).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Unfortunately, we just don’t know. “Many studies don’t differentiate between red and white meat consumption in the subjects, so there are still unanswered questions,” Doyle explains.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When it comes to processed meats, consumers are often concerned with added, synthetic nitrates, which are used to preserve the meats and keep them fresher, longer. If you’re concerned about additives, these more natural-sounding meats might seem appealing. But there’s a catch. Doyle explains that these natural meats (including chicken and turkey) are still processed, and they’re still made with nitrates. “They use natural sources of preservatives,” she says. “Many companies are using celery powder, celery juice or celery salt, which are high in nitrates. They can still label their product ‘nitrate-free’, because those are natural and not synthetic, but they are nitrates nonetheless.” In other words, once you ingest deli turkey or chicken or ham made with celery powder or another natural preservative, you’re still consuming nitrates — it’s just in a different form. “Unfortunately, we just don’t know yet whether these have the same impact as synthetic sources of nitrates.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’ve got a lot of bacon-loving friends who ask me this all the time!” says Doyle. Unfortunately, this is another big question mark. “It isn’t known whether there is a safe level of consumption for processed meat — or for unprocessed red meat,” she says. (Unprocessed red meat, like hamburger and steak, has also been linked to health problems.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle understands the popularity of these snacks as they’re approved for many trendy eating patterns (like <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/best-weight-loss-advice-borrow-popular-diets-ncna926246"">paleo</a> and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keto-diet-it-right-you-ncna847256"">keto</a>), and they’re a portable option for people on the go. However, make no mistake. “They’re still processed meats (and tend to be high sodium), so I’d still advise people limit them,” she says. According to Hu, regular consumption of these foods is not considered a healthy dietary choice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle says that while she hasn’t seen studies specifically calling out smoked salmon, it definitely meets the definition of processed. “And, it’s pretty high in sodium. Bottom line for this and all processed meats: It would be smart to eat fish, poultry and beans over red (unprocessed) meat, and for individuals who do consume processed meat products, to do so sparingly, if at all.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If your mind is spinning with this info and your regular lunch routine or <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/healthy-travel-snacks-ncna1021666"" target=""_blank"">on-the-go snack</a> now feels a little less healthy, here are some ideas for replacing processed meats with whole foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Want more tips like these?

93,Scientists are searching for a mirror universe. It could be sitting right in front of you.,27,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/scientists-are-searching-mirror-universe-it-could-be-sitting-right-ncna1023206,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,17,12,science,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee, physicist Leah Broussard is trying to open a portal to a parallel universe.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She calls it an “oscillation” that would lead her to “mirror matter,” but the idea is fundamentally the same. In a series of experiments she plans to run at Oak Ridge this summer, Broussard will <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00767"" target=""_blank"">send a beam of subatomic particles down a 50-foot tunnel</a>, past a ring of powerful magnets and into an impenetrable wall. If the setup is just right — and if the universe cooperates — some of those particles will transform into mirror-image versions of themselves, allowing them to tunnel right through the wall. And if that happens, Broussard will have uncovered the first evidence of a mirror world right alongside our own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s pretty wacky,” Broussard says of her mind-bending exploration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The mirror world, assuming it exists, would have its own laws of mirror-physics and its own mirror-history. You wouldn’t find a mirror version of yourself there (and no evil Mister Spock with a goatee — sorry ""Star Trek"" fans). But current theory allows that you might find mirror atoms and mirror rocks, maybe even mirror planets and stars. Collectively, they could form an entire shadow world, just as real as our own but almost completely cut off from us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard says her initial search for the mirror world won’t be especially difficult. “This is a pretty straightforward experiment that we cobbled together with parts we found lying around, using equipment and resources we already had available at Oak Ridge,” she says. But if she unequivocally detects even a single mirror particle, it would prove that the visible universe is only half of what is out there — and that the known laws of physics are only half of a much broader set of rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“If you discover something new like that, the game totally changes,” Broussard says.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As with many grand scientific quests, the hunt for mirror matter <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/"" target=""_blank"">grew out of a small, seemingly esoteric mystery</a>. Starting in the 1990s, physicists developed high-precision experiments to study how neutrons — particles found in the nuclei of atoms — break down into protons, a process related to radioactivity. But those experiments took a strange turn.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers found that neutrons created in particle beams, similar to the one Broussard will use, last 14 minutes and 48 seconds, on average, before “decaying” into protons. But neutrons stored in a laboratory bottle seem to break down a bit faster, in 14 minutes and 38 seconds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ten seconds might not sound like much, but the actual difference should be zero: All neutrons are exactly the same, and their behavior should depend not one bit on where or how they are examined.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I take discrepancy very seriously,” says Benjamin Grinstein, a particle-physics expert at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just between two experiments. It is a collection of many experiments done independently by several groups. The newest experiments, conceived in part to resolve the disagreement, <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627"" target=""_blank"">have “only made it worse,”</a> he adds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Grinstein has explored the possibility that some neutrons are unexpectedly breaking down into particles other than protons but has found nothing so far. Mirror matter offers a more elegant, if somewhat bizarre, explanation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A decade ago, Anatoli Serebrov of Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia introduced the idea that ordinary neutrons sometimes cross over into the mirror world and transform into mirror neutrons. At that point, we could no longer detect them — it would be as if some of the neutrons simply vanished. “That would make the neutron lifetime look wrong,” Broussard explains, because some of the neutrons would have been disappearing from the test equipment while the researchers were studying them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Connect the dots, and you reach a far-out conclusion: The neutron experiments might look screwy because physicists unwittingly opened a portal to the mirror world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard’s goal is to find out if that portal really exists and, if so, to open it in a methodical way. That’s where her neutron beam and impenetrable wall come in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Oak Ridge has an 85-megawatt <a href=""https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir"">nuclear reactor</a> that can shoot out billions of neutrons on demand, so getting enough raw material to work with isn’t an issue. The hard part is figuring out how to make some of the neutrons cross over into the mirror world, and then prove to her skeptical colleagues (and to her skeptical self) that it really happened.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Running the experiment will take about one day. Collecting the data and weeding out every possible source of error might then take a few weeks more. Broussard is looking for any telltale neutrons that managed to get past the barrier by turning into mirror neutrons, then turning back. “It all comes down to: Are we able to shine neutrons through a wall?” she says. “We should see no neutrons” according to conventional physics theory. If some of them show up anyway, that would suggest that conventional physics is wrong, and the mirror world is real.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meanwhile, Klaus Kirch is working on a complementary experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Zurich. His plan is to capture slow-moving neutrons, hit them with a magnetic field and then count to see if all the particles are still there. “If some neutrons oscillated into mirror-neutrons, they would disappear from our apparatus,” he says. Kirch's team has already run the experiment and hopes to have their results analyzed later in the summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite their conceptual simplicity, both Broussard’s and Kirch’s experiments are extremely delicate undertakings, dependent on assessing the strange behavior of a few subatomic particles within a crowd of billions. Other researchers have proposed that there might be more blatant signs of a mirror world. We might be seeing it everywhere in the sky.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the 1970s, astronomers have deduced that the universe is packed full of “<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-dark-matter-ncna871991"">dark matter</a>,” a substance that cannot be observed directly but whose powerful gravitational pull helps keep galaxies from flying apart. The latest analyses indicate that dark matter outweighs visible matter by a factor of five. Yet dozens of intensive searches by astronomers around the world have failed to identify what dark matter is made of.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Zurab Berezhiani, a physicist at the University of L’Aquila in Italy who has conducted his own <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6189-y"">mirror neutron searches</a>, offers an intriguing explanation: Dark matter has been hard to find because it is hidden away in the mirror world. In this view, dark matter and mirror matter are one and the same. If so, the mirror world is not just ubiquitous, it is far more massive than our own. At a recent physics conference, Berezhiani <a href=""http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/17-69W/"">expanded on the idea</a>, outlining a possible parallel reality full of mirror stars, mirror galaxies and mirror black holes. Maybe even dark life?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Dark people is probably a bit farfetched,” says Broussard, who confesses that these ideas push her right to the edge of her comfort zone. “But dark matter is very likely as rich as our own matter. This kind of thing needs to be explored.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If she can open a passage to the mirror world at Oak Ridge, that will be one heck of a start.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates. AfricanAmericans<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-african-american-community-progress-our-work-far-over"" target=""_blank""> make up more than 40 percent</a> of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite African Americans comprising only 12 percent of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, when HIV stopped being known as a primarily white gay epidemic, it began to feel more and more like an afterthought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist"">“safe spaces.”</a> In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/20/15821858/gay-pride-flag-philadelphia-fight-explained"">black and brown stripe</a> to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia's gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through <a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"">mandatory anti-discrimination</a> training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other<a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"" target=""_blank""> alleged incidents</a> involving racial discrimination.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I experienced many of these <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"">same policies</a> in the Washington D.C. area when I used to live there. Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color. We watch violence occurring at alarming rates in the Black queer community while <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/07/rainbow-capitalism-is-harmful.html"">rainbow capitalism</a> continues to dominate an “inclusion” conversation that never seems to <em>include</em> us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Black queer people are still fighting for survival, white queer people were fighting for marriage equality. This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
125,We have to stop yelling at each other about abortion and start listening,59,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/abortion-we-need-stop-yelling-each-other-start-listening-everybody-ncna1024766,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,17,12,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Have you ever innocently but loudly misrepresented a story for as long as you can remember and never checked the source material? Of course you haven’t; I never would either. Except that I have so many times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is another one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Take <a href=""https://www.rawstory.com/2017/10/sci-fi-writer-baffles-abortion-foes-with-simple-question-would-you-save-1000-embryos-or-one-child-in-fire/"" target=""_blank"">this thought experiment by Patrick Tomlinson</a>: “You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled, ‘1000 Viable Human Embryos.’ The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die - saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no C. ‘C’ means you all die.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is a hypothetical ultimately meant to test whether one truly believes that life begins at conception and a human embryo has the same value as the life of a child standing before you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Historically in philosophical inquiries of this kind where, say, the choice is between pulling a lever on a speeding train that would kill one man to avoid a collision that would kill five, <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that 90 percent of people choose to save more people at the expense of one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, I used to think that I was landing a rhetorical deathblow when discussing Tomlinson's scenario and it becomes undeniable that no one can really say in earnest that 1,000 embryos are equal to the life of an actual child when danger looms. And I must admit, I am usually waiting for the victorious moment where I say something like, “Seems like you’re struggling. Do you really believe these embryos are actual kids? If you really did believe that, it wouldn't be that hard of a choice for one kid to burn and you are clearly just a woman-hating-liar-fraud with twisty snakes for brains and cleverly hidden horns. Hahahahaha! I gotcha!""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don’t actually say that, but, in my head, I smile beatifically while ascending onto imaginary stage at a strip mall where to be awarded a medal by the ghosts of famous feminists; I can’t wait for ""pro-lifers” to squirm and repent under the irrefutable mirror I feel I am holding up to their dogmatic moral confusion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s gross to admit, but that’s what I’m doing. I have long since ceased to listen, in any meaningful way, to the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what I realized writing this is that I’ve been telling the story wrong the whole time. The way I have been telling it, there is a grown woman behind the clinic door crying for help, instead of the five-year-old child. I smugly misremembered that’s how the story went and I never checked again. The original thought experiment using the child is much more effective in uncovering where our allegiances lie in terms of where life begins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in this culture war, it was just as easy to imagine it as a choice between a live woman or the embryos. That's how it feels, and that’s how I heard it. Telling it that way forces whomever I am sparring against to admit that their stance on the issue is not complicated at all. They must value the tangible life of an individual adult woman over the ambiguously defined potential in the box. If they don’t, they have a clear disdain for women — even, and especially, if they are one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I have been pitting women against each other with my strident lecturing. I have chosen to believe that it isn't difficult to reconcile this hypothetical choice with their actual religious beliefs or their lived experiences, that they should just know it’s only wrong to leave the woman to the fire. (And it might be, but that’s not the point.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In my quest to protect the autonomy and freedom of women, I have become the ultimate conversation stopper. There is nothing to which I don’t have a counterargument, no silence I can’t fill with more statistics. In my head at these moments, I'm wearing a Katherine Hepburn lawyer-type outfit with <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a20874652/sophie-ratner-1973-necklace-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">a 1973 necklace</a> on to represent Roe v. Wade — trust me, it screams ""very confident."" But these are not the actions of a confident woman.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, truthfully, my rhetoric is the reaction of a throaty wild animal sensing the fire. I can feel the room getting smaller and filling with smoke. I am the woman trapped in the fire. I’m sure that the people that burst in the door will choose the theoretical in the refrigerated box over the real woman pleading and coughing in front of them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">How can I become a better listener if I am this afraid? Can we afford to put down our weapons for a moment in this stand off? Do we do it on the count of three? How can I trust you? Or how can you trust me when I have hijacked the conversation and made you my hostage?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Aspen Baker, founder of the women empowering nonprofit group <a href=""https://exhaleprovoice.org"" target=""_blank"">Exhale</a> created a platform/philosophy called “Pro- Voice” that seeks to bridge this battleground. It has only two tenets: That people should listen and share stories. <a href=""http://www.aspenbaker.com/what-is-pro-voice"" target=""_blank"">Her website says</a>, ""Pro-voice focuses on the all-to-often ignored or exploited personal experiences with abortion."" In a 2015 TED Talk, <a href=""https://blog.ted.com/be-pro-voice-aspen-baker-flips-the-conversation-on-abortion-at-tedwomen-2015/"" target=""_blank"">she expanded on that idea</a>: ""The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic grateful for hers... Personal abortion stories don't fit neatly into one camp or the other.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another organization I love called “<a href=""https://www.aisfor.org/"" target=""_blank"">A is For</a>,"" and it seeks to fund access for all reproductive care and to end the obstructions preventing it. But, they also seek to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by sharing stories. Recently, as more anti-abortion bills were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, Utah, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, A is For gathered and shared the stories of women living in those states, no matter what side of the issue they favored.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sharing stories, and the empathy of real listening might be the only thing that has ever touched a heart or changed a mind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If gentle listening, if really telling and hearing stories could disarm the bomb that begins ticking on this battleground every time the opposing sides meet, why do I still have a secret gun, a detonator in my pocket and a knife in my boot? Because another gross thing to admit is that I’m not ready to do what I espouse. I’d rather show you the other versions of this article that are, in fact, ticking and armed with explosions of my rightness. Just me feeling very right over and over! (And I'm wearing the Katherine Hepburn lawyer- type outfit, duh.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the true story that we need to hear is that <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states"" target=""_blank"">one in four American women will have an abortion by age 45</a> and we need to listen to them — as well as the women who chose differently. Barbara Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer and badass Appalachian woman after my heart <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/now/printable/transcript_kingsolver_print.html"" target=""_blank"">once said</a>, “Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It is the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, even though I am scared and prideful, I am offering to lay down my weapons so that I can listen to the stories — all of them, not just the ones that fit my perspective. Will you join me?

""Be proud of the Flag that you wear.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was reacting to a new viral video in which Rapinoe, asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT/status/1143918087735054336"">months ago</a> whether she would visit the White House if invited by the president, responded casually: “Pfft. I’m not going to the f------ White House.” Rapinoe isn’t alone either — teammates Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger and Becky Sauerbrunn have all shared similar sentiments publicly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Apparently to Trump, this means that Rapinoe and her highly decorated teammates don’t respect their country and aren’t patriotic enough.

They were demanding a living wage so they don’t need second jobs, a calendar of regular games to stay sharp and protections so if players get injured (or pregnant) their careers wouldn’t be stuck in limbo — benefits their male counterparts already enjoyed. Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts. Rapinoe and the women of the women’s national team couldn’t be better examples of patriots, whether or not they beat France in Friday’s quarterfinal and continue their campaign to defend their World Cup title.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Caitlin Murray is the author of “<a href=""https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/national-team_9781419734496/"">The National Team: The Inside Story Of The Women Who Changed Soccer</a>,” a narrative history of the U.S. women's national soccer team.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Journalists jostled to capture the historic encounter and even White House officials accompanying the president seemed unsure what would happen next.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This means that we can feel at ease,"" Kim said of the meeting through a translator. ""I believe that this will have a positive force on all of our discussions in the future.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a nod to the unforeseen nature of their rendezvous in the DMZ, Kim told Trump that he ""never expected” to see the president “at this place.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed mid-afternoon in the DMZ and rushed to a vista overlooking North Korea.

He also claimed that tensions with the North had dissipated as soon as he took office, when in fact Trump engaged in a war of words with the North — including his threat to unleash “fire and fury” — that caused significant alarm across Asia and beyond.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ve had peace for two and a half years,"" Trump said Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president also glossed over reports that <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-carrying-out-purge-after-n1012251"" target=""_blank"">Kim had ordered some of his negotiators executed</a> following the failed Hanoi summit.

""I would really hope the rest are too.

Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions.

A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>]"

Even though she was on her family’s health insurance at the time, she said she had to pay <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/u-s-insulin-costs-patient-nearly-doubled-2012-2016-study-n961296"" target=""_blank"">hundreds of dollars every month for her insulin</a>, which was necessary for her survival.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But when the Chicago native moved to Germany, Reich said she was shocked to learn both her insulin and insulin pump were totally covered — no out-of-pocket expenses.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As a student at a public university in Germany, I automatically qualified for the public health care system,” Reich said. “I was really surprised that everything necessary to take care of my diabetes was covered, 100 percent.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Reich said she couldn’t help feeling like a drain on the country’s system, and expressed those feelings to her German friends.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">They reassured her they simply viewed health care differently.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s about having a safety net, because tomorrow you don’t know what could happen,” Reich told NBC News.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Six years later — still living in Germany — Reich has embraced the idea of a safety net.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I don’t need to worry about crazy stuff coming up month to month. I’d rather be paying a steady fee and knowing I’m safe,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Germany has what's called a universal multi-payer health care system. It encompasses both statutory health insurance for people who earn less than a certain salary, as well as private health insurance for those who earn more and choose to purchase their own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Employers and their employees pay for most of the health care system in Germany through premiums. All workers contribute about 7.5 percent of their salary into a public health insurance pool. Employers match that 7.5 percent contribution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This “all for one and one for all” approach to health care has roots in the Middle Ages, when German craftsmen paid into one fund that was used to help any of its members in case someone became ill or suffered financial hardship.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ideology lives on in the modern German system. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We are one big community,” said Dr. Henning Baberg, a cardiologist and the medical director of Helios Hospital Berlin-Buch. “The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“But they all get the same treatment,” he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg likens the difference between statutory and private health insurance in Germany to the difference between economy and business class on a commercial airline flight.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Same flight, same plane, same safety profile.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the system imposes strict limits on out-of-pocket costs, greatly reducing the number of <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/surprise-medical-bills-lead-liens-homes-crippling-debt-n984371"" target=""_blank"">surprise medical bills</a>. The maximum copay for prescription medications is about $10 or $11.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Helene and Michael Sula, both originally from Dallas, are also expatriates like Reich. Unlike Reich, however, they pay for private health insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Sulas chose to live in Germany for its central European location, and were taking advantage of the country’s proximity to the Austrian Alps when Helene tore her anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, while skiing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When I fell, I didn’t think it was that bad,” Helene Sula, 32, recalled. “It wasn’t until a man came up to me and said, ‘We’re going to need to turn your leg back the other way’ that I realized something bad had occurred.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The couple said Helene Sula was lucky to find a doctor who could do an MRI quickly once back in Germany; most places they called were booked for weeks — a common disadvantage for elective procedures. They credited their private health insurance not only with getting a swift diagnosis, but also insisting on having the best surgeon available to do the operation necessary to repair her injured knee.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There’s a price difference, of course, but it’s your knee, so we thought we’d spend a little extra cash to get the best doctor available,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The cost for everything related to Helene Sula’s <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cool-new-knee-procedure-eases-arthritis-pain-without-surgery-n771221"" target=""_blank"">knee surgery</a> was about $2,000, compared with $14,000 for the same treatment in America.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite some language barriers, the Sulas said the German health care system was easy to navigate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s much easier to pay your bills and understand your coverage than in America, where you’re sort of left to figure it out on your own,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Health care industry experts in the United States say the German system is a good example of an employer-based model of medical insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“No one pays more than two percent of their family income for out-of-pocket health care costs” in Germany, said Robin Osborn, director of the International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program at The Commonwealth Fund.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And if you’re sick, if you’re chronically ill, it’s one percent. No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But Osborn does not recommend the U.S. copy Germany’s or any other country’s health care system and adopt it here.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s important to remember that we do have outstanding health care in the United States. We have pockets of excellence. We have integrated delivery systems that are the envy of the world,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s just that not everyone gets that outstanding health care. It doesn’t exist uniformly across the country,” she added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg, who received medical training at the University of California, San Diego, said one advantage the U.S. health care system has is transparency. Although Germans can go to any hospital they want, it’s more difficult for them to find data on quality outcomes for individual facilities.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But, he added, the U.S. health care system is flawed in a different way: Americans with less money get less health care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“That’s wrong,” Baberg said. “That’s not humanity.

""The ‘ōhi‘a forest experience can’t be re-created with substitute species.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More than 2 million ʻōhiʻa trees have been killed by ROD, according to the U.S. Forest Service, and about <a href=""https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/rod/THE-DISEASE"">135,000 acres</a> show symptoms of the disease that was first identified on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, in 2014. Two years later, the state <a href=""https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/blog/main/nr-ohiaquarantine/"">imposed a quarantine</a> to prevent ROD from spreading to other islands. It didn’t work. The <a href=""https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/12/22/fungus-behind-rapid-ohia-death-is-spreading-kauai/"">most aggressive form of the fungus was found on Kauai</a> late last year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Manakō Tanaka, a Hawaiian culture expert at the Oahu Visitors Bureau, said the ʻōhiʻalehua tree and its blossoms have always been ""the first to sprout up after lava flows that wipe forests out.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And so it’s become synonymous with the bravest of warriors who were the strongest and first into battle.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tree is also associated with Laka, the goddess of hula, its flower used in leis for the traditional Hawaiian dance. <a href=""https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/03/31/hawaii-news/ohia-lehua-blight-takes-toll-on-hula-competition/"">In 2016, for the first time in more than 50 years, </a>many hula schools were forced to forgo their adornments because of diminishing ʻōhiʻa stock.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It would be heartbreaking to only be able to show pictures of the tree and its flowers to future generations,” Tanaka said. “Losing the ʻōhiʻa lehua would be like losing a reference encyclopedia into the past.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Experts believe the fungus may have been carried to the islands by unwitting tourists, perhaps on their shoes or hiking boots. It can also be transmitted by dirty tools, woodland animals or the wind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is speculation visitors are responsible for bringing this disease to Hawaii Island,” said Sam Gon, senior scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. “Either because they were uninformed or uncaring about the need to sanitize their gear. ROD could have a devastating effect on our environment and economy, and we need to reform tourism practices among visitors.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The federal government has attempted to stop the fungus and tackle invasive species by imposing a quarantine on Hawaii Island and carrying out extensive tests to learn how the fungus spreads, but it has yet to find a solution. Hawaiian organizations, communities and scientists are now stepping in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gunstock Ranch, a horse riding stable and tourist destination on Oahu, is replanting native trees, although not the ʻōhi‘a yet. After conducting a survey on 80 acres of its land in 2016, and finding just two native species, owner Greg Smith established a Hawaiian <a href=""https://gunstockranch.com/hawaiian-legacy-forest/"">“legacy forest,”</a> where visitors can plant trees and monitor their growth online.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Our hope is that as our guests plant and dedicate a tree they will form a new connection to the land and Hawaii and leave knowing that they made a difference,” Smith said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some tourism companies are sending staff members to workshops to learn how to protect native species through improved biological sanitation practices. Joshua Nipp, founder of <a href=""https://www.offthebeatenpath.com/"">Off the Beaten Path</a> travel company, hopes to establish a bio-sanitation certification program for tour operators.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A coalition of state agencies called the <a href=""https://www.cgaps.org/why-should-we-care/"">Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species</a> is pushing for stronger regulations and tracking of biological products entering Hawaii.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tanaka said tourists can play an important role in staving off ROD, particularly on islands like Oahu, which has not yet been infected with the fungus. He said they should always make sure their shoes are clean and free of debris and seeds, and he urged visitors to stay away from areas marked off-limits to protect delicate ecosystems.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is a proverb in Hawaiian, ‘I aliʻi ka ‘āina, i kauā ke kanaka.’ It means, ‘The land is chief, and men are its stewards,’” Tanaka said. “Sometimes, though, I fear that we may be moving to a world where people think it is the other way around.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
159,"As Facebook cracks down on hate speech, it's also re-evaluating another policy: Nipples",27,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-cracks-down-hate-speech-it-s-also-re-evaluating-n1024746,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,7,43,tech-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The first time Savannah Spirit remembers Facebook censoring her work takes her back to 2011.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was curating a show of erotic art in New York and posted a promotional image to Facebook. The social network promptly took it down, and she was prevented from posting anything else for 10 days.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In the coming years, Spirit, like many other artists, would move to Instagram, where her edgier art — usually with some form of nudity — would often run afoul of the company’s policies and be removed. Complaints and protests from artists and arts organizations in real life and on social media, including at least <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity"">one that went viral</a>, made little progress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I started to decide that it just comes with the territory,” Spirit said of Facebook’s bans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But arts organizations kept at it. In early June, 125 people protested in the nude outside the New York City headquarters of Facebook and Instagram, covering themselves with stickers of photographed male nipples in protest of the long-argued double standard that only female nipples are against the company’s policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The artists’ action speaks to just how important the platforms, especially Instagram, have become to the arts now that Tumblr — once a haven for artists — <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tumblr-ban-all-adult-content-n943226"">does not allow any adult content</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Instagram has been so important for artists, especially those who don’t necessarily have a regular venue for their work,” said Svetlana Mintcheva, director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), an alliance of more than 50 nonprofits. “But they develop huge audiences on Instagram, and photographic artists more so than others.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pressure campaign worked. Facebook said it would organize a group of artists, educators and activists to talk about its policies. It’s a move that is mirrored in the social network’s broader re-evaluation of its content policies as well as its move to find people outside its corporate borders to help rewrite its rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s a start, but the arts community is not declaring victory just yet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t just want to talk,” Svetlana said. “We’d like to see some action, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruchika Budhraja, a spokesperson for Facebook, said the company was committed to meeting with artists, the NCAC and other stakeholders. “It’s important for us to hear directly from different communities who use Facebook and Instagram,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook’s challenges over where to draw the line with nudity in some ways pre-date the now-prominent debate over its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, underscoring how the company’s rules have shifted drastically, often in one direction and then the other, during its meteoric rise.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Facebook banned pornography early on, its efforts to restrict nudity extended to <a href=""https://www.mic.com/articles/90795/how-women-got-facebook-to-tackle-their-nipple-problem"">pictures of breastfeeding</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/facebook-nude-painting-gustave-courbet"">famous French painting</a> of a nude woman and even <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/these-nipples-got-the-new-yorker-banned-from-facebook-5942284"">a New Yorker cartoon</a>. Though the stakes were lower than years later when the company needed to confront issues like fake news and coordinated foreign manipulation campaigns, many activists took the issue no less seriously.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tenacity of the artist community, even years ago, points to just how central both Facebook and Instagram have become to the daily lives of billions of people as well as to the cultures they participate in. And since Facebook would often delete entire accounts along with their work, artists could spend years building up followings only to see them disappear.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It takes years to build up a base of followers, so this is no small deal for artists working with the body,” said Spencer Tunick, an artist <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2008/01/why-doesn-t-spencer-tunick-get-any-respect.html"">known for his use of nudity</a> — particularly groups of naked people — who helped organize the protest in June. “It’s a major issue as we see it now.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tunick credited artist Micol Hebron with being the first person to <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1088838/women-are-putting-male-nipples-over-their-own-to-call-out-censorship-hypocrisy/"">digitize the male nipple</a> in 2014 and she encouraged the public to use it to fight censorship on social media. He stressed that he understands why Facebook needs to draw lines, but that there are ways for the company to embrace experimental art while protecting younger users.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook has shown some flexibility. Gabriella Mas Bell, a lawyer with the law firm Polsinelli who has <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol54/iss1/24/"">written about Facebook’s censorship</a> of artistic nudity, said that she would have to constantly update her work because the company’s terms of service frequently changed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I was having to go back and change the language in my article, so you could tell that they were really trying to address it,” Bell said. “So I’m not actually that surprised they’re trying to find a better solution as they’re cracking down on things like hate speech and the abusive language.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For now, however, artists still have to be careful. Spirit said she recently had four pictures deleted from Instagram and knows other artists who were recently banned from the platform for 24 hours for posting some of Tunick’s images.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said she’s hopeful that Facebook could finally make changes. All it took was a few dozen nude people outside one of their offices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We got their attention,” she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology news at NBC News Digital.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

One of the biggest problems with the program — as Sanders noted — was that African-American children were being bused at great lengths to attend white schools. The recent school integration debate focuses more heavily on the battle between public and charter schools and on efforts to desegregate communities as a whole.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The busing issue — which Biden figured prominently in as a senator in the 1970s — came to the forefront after Harris pushed him Thursday to address his position. In that exchange, Harris said Biden worked with segregationist senators ""to oppose busing,"" adding that a local busing program allowed her to attend an integrated school and obtain a good education.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden pushed back, saying she mischaracterized his position ""across the board"" and highlighted his broad support of civil rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I did not oppose busing in America,"" Biden said.

People face a lot of stresses they're exposed to, a lot of trauma,"" O'Neill said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Dowling is also a medical adviser to the nonprofit <a href=""http://www.poppanewyork.org"" target=""_blank"">Police Organization Providing Peer Assistance</a>, or POPPA, which offers mental health support to NYPD officers and was formed in 1996 after 26 members of the department killed themselves during a two-year period.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This latest string of deaths in such a short time is the worst Dowling can recall since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""If this continues, oh my God — but hopefully this cluster settles,"" he said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Data on suicide rates in law enforcement has been historically incomplete, but recent studies show more officers die by suicide — at least 167 officers in 2018 — than are killed in the line of duty, <a href=""https://bluehelp.org/158-american-police-officers-died-by-suicide-in-2018/"" target=""_blank"">according to Blue H.E.L.P.</a>, a nonprofit made up of active and retired police officers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The <a href=""https://issuu.com/rudermanfoundation/docs/first_responder_white_paper_final_ac270d530f8bfb"" target=""_blank"">Ruderman Family Foundation</a>, a private philanthropic organization, found last year that post-traumatic stress disorder and depression rates among police officers and firefighters are as much as five times higher than for civilians.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">New York City has averaged about four to five police officer suicides a year since 2014, officials said, and in the past six months, there have been six.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/third-new-york-police-officer-dies-suicide-9-days-n1017821"" target=""_blank"">third suicide of an NYPD officer this month</a>, O'Neill declared a ""mental-health crisis.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There is no shame in seeking assistance from the many resources available, both inside and outside the department,"" O'Neill said in a June 14 statement. ""Accepting help is never a sign of weakness — in fact, it's a sign of great strength.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">His comments followed the fourth NYPD officer death on Wednesday, which <a href=""https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Fourth-NYPD-Officer-Suicide-Three-Weeks-511887951.html"" target=""_blank"">NBC New York</a> reported involved a 24-year department veteran who served in the Bronx and shot himself while off-duty at his home on Long Island.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The other incidents this month involved a deputy chief who was set to retire and a veteran homicide detective — both of whom died within 24 hours of each other — and a 29-year-old patrolman who took his life outside of a precinct on Staten Island.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The city of Chicago has also <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/veteran-chicago-detective-killed-himself-latest-suicide-among-city-s-n981861"" target=""_blank"">grappled with a cluster of police suicides</a>, with at least three this year and four last year, officials said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">O'Neill said his department reached out to Chicago's police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, who recommended New York look at expanding its peer-to-peer resources and evaluate its policy for when an officer's firearm should be taken away.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""One of the biggest challenges — and why it takes courage to get help — is as someone's becoming anxious, depressed, jumpy, maybe starting to self-medicate with alcohol, get burnt out, it becomes tougher for that person to believe they can get help and that help will work,"" Dowling said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In April, the NYPD and the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization that works to improve the professionalism of policing, hosted a symposium on law enforcement suicide. The forum's executive director, Chuck Wexler, said an important takeaway was that police departments and other law enforcement agencies must do a better job of capturing and analyzing police suicide data because ""the research is really uneven.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We advocated that agencies should conduct psychological autopsies on suicides and learn what were the circumstances that resulted in these tragedies,"" Wexler said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We don't even know how many people have attempted suicide,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The danger is amplified for officers who are battling depression and mental health issues because they have easier access to weapons, Wexler said. For some officers, he added, the idea of coming forward about their mental health — then having their firearms confiscated for safety — can only make them less likely to speak up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There's no question that what makes police officers at-risk is because they have an occupational need to have a firearm, and in many of these cases, firearms are the way officers take their lives,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a combustible mixture when you have someone who's dealing with some significant personal issues and the availability of a firearm.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean Powers, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD who retired in 2005, said the fear for some officers is not only that their guns could be taken away, but they would be placed on desk assignment or left monitoring surveillance cameras instead of being out on the beat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""You lose your identity,"" he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, 56, became a volunteer with POPPA, the peer-assistance program, with the desire to help his fellow officers, many struggling with trauma from 9/11. Not long after joining POPPA, he said, he got a call from an officer who was threatening to shoot himself in a quiet parking lot outside of a church on Staten Island. In that case, the officer was helped before he could do any physical harm.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the NYPD and the city of New York provides <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/human-resources-info/employee-assistance-unit.page"" target=""_blank"">internal resources to officers</a>, POPPA offers anonymous counseling services outside of the department. And having a fellow officer to turn to can be advantageous over someone unfamiliar with law enforcement policies, Powers said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Sometimes we get cops who really need to vent, and so you understand the lingo and the jargon. You might not have worked at the same exact precinct or done the same exact job, but you know what they're talking about,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, who also has a sister in the NYPD who volunteers with POPPA, knows he has made a difference when he gets Christmas cards from officers thanking him because they decided not to take their own lives and instead spent another holiday with their families.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After the recent spate of suicides within the NYPD, Powers said, he has reached out to people he knows on the force and asked them to look out for one another.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It's frustrating seeing this happen in your own backyard,"" he added, ""and you think, 'Why didn't he call?'""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>Editor's note: If you are looking for help, please call the <a href=""https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"" target=""_blank"">National Suicide Prevention hotline</a> at 1-800-273-8255.

188,Remembering why Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza,56,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/remembering-why-black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-podcast-transcript-ncna1013901,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,7,43,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>“Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things.

But while June has become a month-long celebration for many, it’s apparent that we currently have two different prides occurring.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While rainbows are replacing corporation logos across the nation, Black folks like myself are attending rallies for the death of our trans sisters — most recently <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/activists-demand-justice-for-layleen-polanco-a-black-t-1835379347"">Layleen Polanco Xtranveganza</a>, who was found dead in her jail cell in Rikers Island, and <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trans-women-killed-fairmount-heights"">Zoe Spears</a>, who was shot to death on June 15. Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates. AfricanAmericans<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-african-american-community-progress-our-work-far-over"" target=""_blank""> make up more than 40 percent</a> of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite African Americans comprising only 12 percent of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, when HIV stopped being known as a primarily white gay epidemic, it began to feel more and more like an afterthought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist"">“safe spaces.”</a> In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/20/15821858/gay-pride-flag-philadelphia-fight-explained"">black and brown stripe</a> to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia's gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through <a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"">mandatory anti-discrimination</a> training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other<a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"" target=""_blank""> alleged incidents</a> involving racial discrimination.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I experienced many of these <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"">same policies</a> in the Washington D.C. area when I used to live there. Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color. We watch violence occurring at alarming rates in the Black queer community while <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/07/rainbow-capitalism-is-harmful.html"">rainbow capitalism</a> continues to dominate an “inclusion” conversation that never seems to <em>include</em> us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Black queer people are still fighting for survival, white queer people were fighting for marriage equality. This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Of course you haven’t; I never would either. Except that I have so many times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is another one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Take <a href=""https://www.rawstory.com/2017/10/sci-fi-writer-baffles-abortion-foes-with-simple-question-would-you-save-1000-embryos-or-one-child-in-fire/"" target=""_blank"">this thought experiment by Patrick Tomlinson</a>: “You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled, ‘1000 Viable Human Embryos.’ The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die - saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no C. ‘C’ means you all die.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is a hypothetical ultimately meant to test whether one truly believes that life begins at conception and a human embryo has the same value as the life of a child standing before you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Historically in philosophical inquiries of this kind where, say, the choice is between pulling a lever on a speeding train that would kill one man to avoid a collision that would kill five, <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that 90 percent of people choose to save more people at the expense of one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, I used to think that I was landing a rhetorical deathblow when discussing Tomlinson's scenario and it becomes undeniable that no one can really say in earnest that 1,000 embryos are equal to the life of an actual child when danger looms. And I must admit, I am usually waiting for the victorious moment where I say something like, “Seems like you’re struggling. Do you really believe these embryos are actual kids? If you really did believe that, it wouldn't be that hard of a choice for one kid to burn and you are clearly just a woman-hating-liar-fraud with twisty snakes for brains and cleverly hidden horns. Hahahahaha! I gotcha!""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don’t actually say that, but, in my head, I smile beatifically while ascending onto imaginary stage at a strip mall where to be awarded a medal by the ghosts of famous feminists; I can’t wait for ""pro-lifers” to squirm and repent under the irrefutable mirror I feel I am holding up to their dogmatic moral confusion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s gross to admit, but that’s what I’m doing. I have long since ceased to listen, in any meaningful way, to the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what I realized writing this is that I’ve been telling the story wrong the whole time. The way I have been telling it, there is a grown woman behind the clinic door crying for help, instead of the five-year-old child. I smugly misremembered that’s how the story went and I never checked again. The original thought experiment using the child is much more effective in uncovering where our allegiances lie in terms of where life begins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in this culture war, it was just as easy to imagine it as a choice between a live woman or the embryos. That's how it feels, and that’s how I heard it. Telling it that way forces whomever I am sparring against to admit that their stance on the issue is not complicated at all. They must value the tangible life of an individual adult woman over the ambiguously defined potential in the box. If they don’t, they have a clear disdain for women — even, and especially, if they are one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I have been pitting women against each other with my strident lecturing. I have chosen to believe that it isn't difficult to reconcile this hypothetical choice with their actual religious beliefs or their lived experiences, that they should just know it’s only wrong to leave the woman to the fire. (And it might be, but that’s not the point.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In my quest to protect the autonomy and freedom of women, I have become the ultimate conversation stopper. There is nothing to which I don’t have a counterargument, no silence I can’t fill with more statistics. In my head at these moments, I'm wearing a Katherine Hepburn lawyer-type outfit with <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a20874652/sophie-ratner-1973-necklace-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">a 1973 necklace</a> on to represent Roe v. Wade — trust me, it screams ""very confident."" But these are not the actions of a confident woman.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, truthfully, my rhetoric is the reaction of a throaty wild animal sensing the fire. I can feel the room getting smaller and filling with smoke. I am the woman trapped in the fire. I’m sure that the people that burst in the door will choose the theoretical in the refrigerated box over the real woman pleading and coughing in front of them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">How can I become a better listener if I am this afraid? Can we afford to put down our weapons for a moment in this stand off? Do we do it on the count of three? How can I trust you? Or how can you trust me when I have hijacked the conversation and made you my hostage?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Aspen Baker, founder of the women empowering nonprofit group <a href=""https://exhaleprovoice.org"" target=""_blank"">Exhale</a> created a platform/philosophy called “Pro- Voice” that seeks to bridge this battleground. It has only two tenets: That people should listen and share stories. <a href=""http://www.aspenbaker.com/what-is-pro-voice"" target=""_blank"">Her website says</a>, ""Pro-voice focuses on the all-to-often ignored or exploited personal experiences with abortion."" In a 2015 TED Talk, <a href=""https://blog.ted.com/be-pro-voice-aspen-baker-flips-the-conversation-on-abortion-at-tedwomen-2015/"" target=""_blank"">she expanded on that idea</a>: ""The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic grateful for hers... Personal abortion stories don't fit neatly into one camp or the other.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another organization I love called “<a href=""https://www.aisfor.org/"" target=""_blank"">A is For</a>,"" and it seeks to fund access for all reproductive care and to end the obstructions preventing it. But, they also seek to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by sharing stories. Recently, as more anti-abortion bills were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, Utah, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, A is For gathered and shared the stories of women living in those states, no matter what side of the issue they favored.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sharing stories, and the empathy of real listening might be the only thing that has ever touched a heart or changed a mind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If gentle listening, if really telling and hearing stories could disarm the bomb that begins ticking on this battleground every time the opposing sides meet, why do I still have a secret gun, a detonator in my pocket and a knife in my boot? Because another gross thing to admit is that I’m not ready to do what I espouse. I’d rather show you the other versions of this article that are, in fact, ticking and armed with explosions of my rightness. Just me feeling very right over and over! (And I'm wearing the Katherine Hepburn lawyer- type outfit, duh.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the true story that we need to hear is that <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states"" target=""_blank"">one in four American women will have an abortion by age 45</a> and we need to listen to them — as well as the women who chose differently. Barbara Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer and badass Appalachian woman after my heart <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/now/printable/transcript_kingsolver_print.html"" target=""_blank"">once said</a>, “Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It is the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, even though I am scared and prideful, I am offering to lay down my weapons so that I can listen to the stories — all of them, not just the ones that fit my perspective.

Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts. Rapinoe and the women of the women’s national team couldn’t be better examples of patriots, whether or not they beat France in Friday’s quarterfinal and continue their campaign to defend their World Cup title.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Caitlin Murray is the author of “<a href=""https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/national-team_9781419734496/"">The National Team: The Inside Story Of The Women Who Changed Soccer</a>,” a narrative history of the U.S. women's national soccer team.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>, <p>Don't miss out.

Then he called it a ""great honor"" to be with Putin, praising their ""very, very good relationship"" and predicting ""a lot of very positive things"" would result.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As reporters shouted questions and cameras clicked, Trump cocked his head when asked by NBC News whether he would tell Putin not to interfere in the vote next year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The answer to the question is, of course I will. 'Don’t meddle in the election,'"" Trump said. As Putin smiled broadly, Trump briefly raised his finger toward Putin before turning away and repeating: ""Don’t meddle in the election.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over the din in the meeting room, it was unclear whether Trump had initially said, ""Don't meddle in the election, please,"" or ""Don't meddle in the election, president."" Journalists in the room and watching video of the exchange heard him say ""please,"" but a White House transcript later maintained that Trump had said ""president.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Either way, Trump’s casual comments to Putin were unlikely to satisfy his critics, who have lambasted him for <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-discussed-mueller-report-agreed-no-collusion-white-house-n1001706"" target=""_blank"">repeatedly casting doubt</a> on whether Russia interfered in 2016 despite the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/information-warfare-how-russians-interfered-2016-election-n848746"" target=""_blank"">firm assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies </a>and former<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/video/what-s-next-in-the-mueller-probe-1446044739569"" target=""_blank""> special counsel Robert Mueller</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump continues to dismiss the Mueller probe as a ""witch hunt,"" and Putin says he agrees.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/878d2344-98f0-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times interview</a> just ahead of the G-20, Putin brushed off ""mythical"" Russian interference and argued that Trump really won the election because he ""looked into his opponents’ attitude to him and saw changes in American society, and he took advantage of it.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">With the Mueller investigation complete, Trump and Putin are entering a new period in which the years-long probe no longer hangs over them, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-russia-china-plotting-interfere-2020-election-n963896"" target=""_blank"">although Congress continues to investigate</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Offering an outstretched hand to Trump, the Russian leader invited him next May to attend Moscow's massive annual World War II victory parade, which most global leaders have traditionally shunned. The Kremlin told Russian media that Trump has ""reacted positively to the invitation,"" although a White House official would say only that while Trump supports commemorating Allied troops who died in the war, ""he has not confirmed participation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In recent weeks, Trump has renewed concerns about his seriousness in confronting Russia’s efforts to interfere in U.S. democracy by <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/i-think-i-d-take-it-trump-says-he-d-n1017031"" target=""_blank"">saying he would listen to damaging information</a> offered from foreign governments about one of his political opponents.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Amid the ensuing uproar, Trump shifted position and argued that he would also tell the FBI.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump's playful approach to broaching the election issue with Putin stood in sharp contrast to outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, who chided Putin for ""hostile interventions in other countries, disinformation and cyberattacks, which undermine Russia’s standing in the world,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. In her meeting with Putin at the G-20, May also confronted the Russian president on Moscow's actions in Ukraine, LGBT rights and what she called ""irrefutable evidence"" that Russia used a chemical weapon on British soil.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Trump's meeting with Putin got underway, he told reporters they would be discussing trade, disarmament and “a little protectionism, perhaps.” The White House later said they had discussed Iran, Syria and Ukraine and had agreed “that improved relations between the United States and Russia was in each countries’ mutual interest and the interest of the world.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Putin, for his part, said the two leaders had much to discuss in Osaka, noting that they had not seen each other since the Helsinki summit. Still, he said through a translator that their teams had been working together in the interim and said their session in Osaka would be “a great opportunity to follow up on that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two sat side to side in front of Russian and American flags, flanked by their delegation. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump’s senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Accompanying Putin were Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other Russian officials.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A White House description of the meeting later said Trump had told Putin that “a 21st century model of arms control” must include China. It was a reference to the New START nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, set to expire in 2021, and the Trump administration’s desire that any renewal of the agreement also include China, which is not currently bound by the treaty.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meeting later in the day with the Brazilian leader, Trump told reporters he and Putin had discussed ""a lot of things"" — including Venezuela, where Russia is supporting embattled President Nicolás Maduro while the United States has recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ll have to see what happens with Venezuela,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Josh Lederman is a national political reporter for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Kristen Welker is a White House correspondent for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Hans Nichols is NBC News' Pentagon correspondent. </p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

214,15-year-old Cori Gauff upsets Venus Williams at Wimbledon,16,https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/07/01/venus-williams-cori-gauff-wimbledon/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,18,35,https:,"[<p>WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — Coco Gauff grew up admiring the Williams sisters. Picked up a tennis racket as a little girl because of them. And on Monday at Wimbledon, still just 15, Gauff beat one of them.</p>, <p>Gauff, already the youngest competitor ever to qualify at the All England Club in the professional era, showed the poise and power of a much older, much more experienced player, pulling off a 6-4, 6-4 victory in the first round over Venus Williams, who at 39 was the oldest woman in the field.</p>, <p>When it ended, Gauff dropped her racket and put her hands on her head. After a handshake and exchange of words at the net with Williams, Gauff knelt by her sideline chair and tears welled in her eyes. Up in the stands, her father leaped out of his seat.</p>, <p>“Honestly, I don’t really know how to feel. This is the first time I ever cried after a match. Or winning, obviously; I’ve cried after a loss before,” said Gauff, who is based in Florida. “I don’t even know how to explain how I feel.”</p>, <p>This was her third tour-level match; Williams has played more than 1,000. This was Gauff’s first at Wimbledon, where Williams has played more than 100 and won five titles. By the time Gauff was born in 2004, Williams already had spent time at No. 1 in the ranking and owned four of her seven Grand Slam singles trophies.</p>, <p>It was by far the most anticipated match of Day 1 at the grass-court tournament, but hardly the only upset. Two-time major champion Naomi Osaka, who was No. 1 until a week ago, lost 7-6 (4), 6-2 to Yulia Putinseva, joining two young members of the men’s top-10, No. 6 seed Alexander Zverev and No. 7 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, on the way out.</p>, <p>Gauff came into the week outside the top 300 but was granted a wild card by the All England Club for qualifying. She rolled through those rounds at a nearby site, knocking off the event’s top seed.</p>, <p>But this was a whole other task: a main-draw match against an idol on No. 1 Court, with its seating capacity of more than 12,000.</p>, <p>Gauff was sensational and showed zero signs of the moment or the matchup being too daunting for her. It’s the sort of unusual calm and steady way she has progressed through the various levels of youth tennis, including reaching the U.S. Open junior final at 13 and winning the French Open junior title at 14.</p>, <p>The first set was remarkable: Gauff had 10 winners to only two unforced errors, all the while trading powerful groundstrokes at the baseline with Williams, and never facing a break point.</p>, <p>“The sky’s the limit,” Williams said. “It really is.”</p>, <p>Gauff, who is black, long looked up to Williams and her younger sister, Serena, the first African American women since Althea Gibson in the 1950s to win a Grand Slam singles championship.</p>, <p>Asked about Gauff over the weekend, Serena said she reminds her of Venus.</p>, <p>When they spoke after Monday’s match, Gauff said she thanked Venus “for everything she did.”</p>, <p>“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for her,” said Gauff, who joined the crowd in applauding for Venus as she walked off the court. “And I was just telling her that she’s so inspiring. Like, I always wanted to tell her that. And even though I met her before, I guess now I have the guts to.”</p>, <p>She showed plenty of grit in this match, particularly after getting broken to make it 4-all in the second set. Gauff steadied herself right there, though, breaking right back with a pair of forehand passing shots that drew errant volleys.</p>, <p>And then in the final game, Gauff needed to erase the disappointment of wasting her initial three match points. She did just that, converting her fourth when Venus put a forehand into the net.</p>, <p>“I never thought this would happen,” Gauff said. “I’m literally living my dream right now. And not many people get to say that.”</p>, <p><b>WIMBLEDON: <a href=""https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/06/28/2019-wimbledon-mens-draw-bracket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Men’s Draw</a> | <a href=""https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/06/28/2019-wimbledon-womens-draw-bracket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Draw</a></b></p>, <p><strong>OlympicTalk is on <a href=""https://apple.news/TpWxoEZkEM5q1LCuelKJyZg"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple News</a>.

</strong></p>, <p><strong>Naomi Osaka </strong>was asked after her first-round Wimbledon loss about splitting from her coach in the winter, about inconsistency, about restoring confidence. Finally, about getting used to her new level of global fame.</p>, <p>“Can I leave?” the No. 2 seed said after that 11th question of her press conference following a 7-6 (4), 6-2 loss to 39th-ranked <strong>Yulia Putintseva</strong>. “I feel like I’m about to cry.”</p>, <p>Osaka became the highest-ranked women’s singles seed to lose in the first round of Wimbledon since <strong>Martina Hingis </strong>in 2001 on Monday. Putintseva swept her for the second time in the last two weeks.</p>, <p>Osaka, who broke through with back-to-back hardcourt Slams at the U.S. Open in September and the Australian Open in January, has lost in the first week of back-to-back Slams on clay and grass.</p>, <p>She committed 38 unforced errors as the 5-foot-4 Putintseva had twice as many winners as unforced errors, 15 to seven, in her first time on tennis’ most famous court.</p>, <p>A reporter asked if the parity atop women’s tennis — Osaka is the lone multiple winner of the last 10 Grand Slams — softened the blow of the defeat.</p>, <p>“That makes me feel worse,” she said.

215,FDA names 16 brands of dog food linked to canine heart disease,17,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-names-16-brands-dog-food-linked-canine-heart-disease-n1025466,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,18,35,health,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sixteen brands of dog food may be associated with a heightened risk of heart failure in dogs, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA isn't suggesting that pet owners stop feeding their dogs the particular brands yet, but some vets are already advising against ""grain free"" foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The FDA is currently investigating more than 500 reports that appear to link dog foods that are marketed as ""grain free"" to canine dilated cardiomyopathy. <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dog-heart-disease-linked-food-fda-says-n891011"" target=""_blank"">The FDA has been warning about the foods</a> based on peas, lentils or potatoes since July 2018, but the statement released late last week is the first time the agency has identified the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/news-events/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy"" target=""_blank"">16 brand names.</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The brands are ordered by the number of cases linked to them, which ranged from a high of 67 to 10:</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Most of the reports were associated with dry dog food formulations, but raw food, semi-moist food and wet foods were included. The FDA has not suggested owners change their pets’ diets.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We’re not saying don’t use these brands, we’re just telling pet owners to work directly with their veterinarians because we’re still investigating,” Lindsay Haake, a spokesperson for the FDA, said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the vast majority of cases have been in dogs, there have also been some in cats.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Veterinary cardiologists told NBC News that they aren’t waiting for the FDA investigation to conclude before advising owners to stop feeding the suspect pet foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When a dog comes to us and we learn during the history that it’s on a grain-free diet, we advise switching to a non-grain-free diet,” said Dr. Anna Gelzer, a veterinary cardiologist and an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “There’s no scientifically proven benefit to grain-free foods, so why take a chance?”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a statement, the Pet Food Institute, whose members make 98 percent of U.S. pet foods and treats, said it and its members “have convened nutritionists, veterinarians and product safety specialists for more than a year to better understand whether there is a relationship between dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and diet. PFI agrees with the FDA's statements that this is a complex issue with many factors requiring scientific evaluation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Heart failure is a known issue for larger breeds of dogs, such as Great Danes and German Shepherds, Gelzer said. The breeds most frequently reported to the FDA for the heart disease were golden retrievers, mixed and Labrador retrievers<strong>.</strong></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But recently the condition started showing up in smaller breeds, which is what caught the attention of veterinarians and eventually the FDA.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“For us at Penn, we started to see cases in late 2017 that stuck out as unusual because they were in smaller breeds such as springer spaniels and beagles that you don’t typically see with canine dilated cardiomyopathy,” Gelzer said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Knowing there had been studies showing that diet could play a role in the development of heart disease in dogs, “we started making investigations into what each owner was feeding.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ultimately Gelzer and others found there was a common denominator: grain-free dog foods, which had replaced grains with substitutes such as lentils, peas and chickpeas.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gelzer doesn’t know exactly how the grain-free pet food trend started, but suspects it had to do with consumer demand for what seemed like a healthier alternative.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It didn’t come from the science side,” Gelzer said. “If you think about wolves, they may ingest the contents of ruminant animals they preyed on, so they are certainly capable of eating grain. There’s no scientific reason for going without grain.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Generally when dogs develop a food allergy, it’s to a protein, Gelzer said. So, veterinarians will often switch to a food with a different protein source to treat the problem.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">One of the big problems with DCM is that dogs don’t show symptoms of the disease — lethargy, exercise intolerance, shortness of breath — until they’re very sick, Gelzer said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She points to the example of clients who came in with a very sick dog that was diagnosed with DCM. The family had a second dog that seemed healthy, but because both were eating a grain-free dog food, Gelzer suggested bringing in the second dog to be checked.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">What we don’t know is if [the foods] used in these diets in place of grains are causing the problem. It’s also possible that could be some kind of toxin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When we evaluated that dog, it also had decreased heart function, but it was still subclinical,” she said. “The dog didn’t look abnormal because it was at an early stage.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gelzer isn’t sure what the results will be if those early stage dogs are switched to a different food. “Some get better when the diet is changed,” she said. “Some stay the same and keep the status quo with medications and some die despite changing the diet and getting all the heart medications we can give.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While it’s clear that pet owners are feeding these brands because they “are trying to do what they perceive as the right thing for their dogs, unless the dog has a documented sensitivity to grains, it’s probably not worth the risk at this point to feed these products,” said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, a veterinary cardiologist in the department of clinical sciences at the Veterinary College of Cornell University and associate director of the Cornell Feline Health Center.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What we don’t know is if [the foods] used in these diets in place of grains are causing the problem,” Kornreich said. “It’s also possible that could be some kind of toxin.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Kornreich suggests pet owners switch to a brand “produced by a company with a long-standing history.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If a pet dog is showing any symptoms of the heart condition, including decreased energy, cough or difficulty breathing, the FDA urges owners to contact a vet as soon as possible.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News and Reuters Health.

A trade deal between the two countries fell through in the beginning of May.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The South China Sea, which is home to more than 200 specks of land, serves as a gateway to global sea routes where approximately $3.4 trillion of trade passes annually.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The numerous overlapping sovereign claims to islands, reefs and rocks — many of which disappear under high tide — have turned the waters into an armed camp. Beijing holds the lion's share of these features with approximately 27 outposts peppered throughout.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In May 2018, <a href=""105165638"">China quietly installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems</a> on three of its fortified outposts west of the Philippines in the South China Sea, a move that allows Beijing to further project its power in the hotly disputed waters, according to sources with direct knowledge of U.S. intelligence reports.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to U.S. intelligence reports, the installations mark the first Chinese missile deployments to Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands.

Cook said the report does not match reality and fails to understand how Apple's design team actually works.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The story is absurd,"" Cook said in an email. ""A lot of the reporting, and certainly the conclusions, just don’t match with reality.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Cook does not often publicly rebut news reports but he appeared compelled to do so given his frustrations with the article, which said that the company is prioritizing operations at the expense of design.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“At a base level, it shows a lack of understanding about how the design team works and how Apple works,” Cook said. “It distorts relationships, decisions and events to the point that we just don’t recognize the company it claims to describe.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Colleen Schwartz, senior vice president of communications for The Wall Street Journal, said in a statement that the newspapers stands by its reporting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The rebuttal from Cook, who took over the top job at Apple after the death of Steve Jobs, comes as the company is trying to demonstrate that Ive's departure is not a sign of greater troubles.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ive, who was responsible for the look of many of Apple's most iconic products, including the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/jony-ive-iconic-designer-behind-apple-s-iphone-leaving-company-n1023486"">announced Thursday</a> that he would leave the company to start his own design firm, though he will continue to work with Apple as a contractor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“While I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved — I hope for many, many years to come,” Ive told the Financial Times. “This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But on Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal's Tripp Mickle reported that Ive ""had been growing more distant from Apple’s leadership"" in part because he was frustrated with Cook's ""more operations-focused company,” according to several sources familiar with his departure who were not named.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""People in the design studio rarely saw Mr. Cook, who they say showed little interest in the product development process — a fact that dispirited Mr. Ive,"" Mickle reported.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Mr. Ive grew frustrated as Apple’s board became increasingly populated by directors with backgrounds in finance and operations rather than technology or other areas of the company’s core business,"" the report stated.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Apple has in the past decade become one of the world’s most valuable companies, it now faces scrutiny over its ability to continue creating new products that change the way consumers interact with the world. It remains massively profitable, with $30 billion in earnings over the last six months, but analysts have expressed concern over the fact that it hasn't had a major product hit since the iPad, in 2010. (Sales for the Apple Watch and AirPods, while popular, remain relatively small by comparison.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While growth in hardware sales slows, Apple has spent years investing more heavily in software and services. Nevertheless, Ive's departure caused some alarm among analysts who closely watch Apple. Ive and Jobs worked hand in glove to create many of Apple's best products, and he was long seen as one of the most influential figures at the company. Mickle describes him as ""Jobs’s protégé — and Apple’s closest thing to a living embodiment of his spirit.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Responsibility for Apple's future design will now fall to Jeff Williams, the chief operating officer; Evans Hankey, who oversees industrial design; and Alan Dye, who oversees user interface design.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The design team is phenomenally talented,"" Cook told NBC News.

Researchers have some hypotheses, but so far there is no scientific consensus.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some scientists link the puzzling reversal in Antarctic sea ice to the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/good-news-about-ozone-hole-even-better-you-think-ncna835971"" target=""_blank"">ozone hole over Antarctica</a>, Parkinson said. During the 1980s and ’90s, heavy use of aerosol sprays, refrigerants and other products containing compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons thinned the ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere and allowed more warming ultraviolet rays from the sun to reach the planet’s surface. Chlorofluorcarbons were phased out as part of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, helping <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/earth-s-ozone-layer-finally-healing-un-says-ncna931591"" target=""_blank"">restore ozone levels</a> and presumably cooling the ocean and helping raise levels of Antarctic sea ice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Other researchers say the shifting levels of sea ice could represent natural climate patterns.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">One such pattern is <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/el-ni-o-back-it-blame-our-severe-weather-woes-ncna1012526"" target=""_blank"">El Niño</a>, which occurs when changes in the strength or direction of trade winds every two to seven years causes waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean to become unusually warm. Another is the so-called <a href=""http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/adai/papers/DongDai-CD2015-IPO.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation</a>, which every decade or two alters air pressure, sea temperatures and wind direction.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are warmer than usual, there are shifts in precipitation and shifts in the pattern of winds driven from the tropics,” said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who was not involved with the new study.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Atmospheric shifts tied to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation that lasted from 1999 to 2013 boosted winds at high southern latitudes around Antarctica during this time — a shift that could have reduced the extent of sea ice around Antarctica by pushing it northward. “You have this mechanism where the winds expand the ice out as far as the wind will blow it,” Meehl said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From 2014 to 2016, the <a href=""http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/Atmosphere-and-climate/interdecadal-pacific-oscillations.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation shifted again</a>, which may have had the opposite effect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But scientists agreed that more research is needed to better understand the waxing and waning of sea ice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We’ve now got 40 years of data, so we can look more holistically at the interactions between the tropics and the polar regions, the ice and atmosphere,” said Julie Arblaster, an atmospheric scientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who was not involved with the new study.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers are also keen to understand the impact of rising global temperatures on sea ice. Meehl said climate change has probably amplified natural shifts in sea ice levels but said more data and better climate models will be needed before scientists can fully understand the possible connection.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t have really long records in this region, which makes it difficult,” Arblaster said, adding that four decades actually represented a small window of time. “But the question of how climate change is interacting with natural variability is very much a question that we need to grapple with. So far our understand is that there have been bouts of natural variability that leads to what we’ve seen, but the longer it goes on and the longer sea ice stays at record lows, the question of climate change has to come into this.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Denise Chow is a reporter and editor at NBC News MACH.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Plus, working some of the biggest muscles in the body (the glutes and legs) helps to burn more calories, speed up your metabolism and burn fat. By strengthening your glutes with our monthly plan, you’ll not only feel tighter and more toned, but also more stable with improved balance throughout your whole body.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There are three major muscles in your glutes — the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus — that work together to rotate, abduct and extend the hip. Fun fact: They’re also the largest and strongest muscles in the body.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When we build and tone the muscles of the butt (plus add in cardio), we’re not only building sleek muscle, but also burning fat and calories, and both of these things work as a one-two punch to building a more toned backside.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">To help you tone the glutes from every angle, we’ve broken down our monthly routine into three exercise banks: standing exercises, modified plank exercises and floor exercises. Each of these three positions provides options for working the muscles in various planes of motion to effectively work the entire glute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the glutes and legs are large muscles, it’s recommended to perform these exercises every other day (rather than doing the standing glute exercises today and then the lying down exercises tomorrow.) In between, take a day off from working your lower body and do something else like cardio from our <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/30-day-walk-run-interval-training-plan-no-gym-required-ncna1010136"" target=""_blank"">walking plan</a> or abdominals from our <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/31-day-abdominal-workout-plan-summer-ncna1000226"" target=""_blank"">abs plan</a>.

Bend the back knee towards the ground as you bend the front knee tracking over the ankle. From here, press down through the front foot’s heel and pull the back knee up and forward towards your chest. Work the standing leg glute even more with an added squeeze at the top as the opposite knee comes up and through. Step the knee back and lower the foot back down, and repeat 10 times. Switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing upright, step your left leg out to the side and bend the left knee into a halfway side lunge. Press off through the left heel and bring the leg and knee back to center. Lift the knee up towards your chest as you squeeze your right glute and press down through the right heel. Repeat 10 times on this side and then switch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing upright, balance on the right foot. Extend the left leg behind you, and lean forward as you lift the left leg up behind you until it is parallel to the floor. Keep the leg straight and squeeze the left glute at the top. Then lower the leg back down towards the ground and bring your torso up to center. Repeat 10 times, then switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Step to the right and bend the right knee. From this side lunge, lift the left leg up and pulse it up as high as your hip, then tap it back down to the ground. Repeat this 10 times, and then switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees and sit your glutes back as if you’re sitting into a chair. Pull your naval in towards your spine and make sure your knees aren’t going forward past your toes. Then press down through the heels to stand back up while squeezing your glutes. Repeat this 10 times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">With your naval pulling in on your hands and knees, extend the right leg behind you. Lift the leg up as high as your hips, then tap it to the right. Lift it back up and bring it back to center. Lift and tap 10 times, then switch legs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">On your hands and knees, lift your right knee off the ground and pull your right heel towards your right glute creating a 90-degree angle. Push your right foot up towards the ceiling to engage the back of the leg and glute, and then release it back down to the starting position. Repeat 10 times, then switch legs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From hands and knees, lift the right knee off of the ground. Open the right knee to the right (as if you’re a doggy lifting your leg up to urinate!). Then bring it back towards center. Repeat this 10 times, then switch to the left leg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Perform the exercise above, except instead of coming back to center, press the leg straight on a diagonal. Then bring it back to the fire hydrant position, and back to center. Repeat 10 times on the right, and then switch to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lying on your side, with your legs stacked on top of each other, lift your right leg up towards the ceiling, and then lower it back down. Slowly do this so that you feel the outer hip and glute engaging. Lift and lower 10 times, then repeat on the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From the above position, lift the top so that your legs are not touching (about a foot above the bottom leg) and draw circles with your leg. Draw ten circles to the front, than reverse and draw ten towards the back. Switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lying on your side with your top leg elevated, bend your right knee in towards your chest, then extend if out towards the front as if you’re pushing down on a bike pedal, press the leg back straight, and then bend the knee back in towards the chest. Repeat this 10 times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Then ride the bike backwards on the same side!

For Huawei, the two are not mutually exclusive.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">President Donald Trump announced Saturday that the Chinese telecom giant, which became one of the major pivot points of the trade negotiations between the United States and China, would be free to buy some products from U.S. tech companies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The announcement was a change of course for the U.S., which in late May <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-ban-chinese-telecom-giant-huawei-could-cut-rural-n1010311"" target=""_blank"">added Huawei to a list </a>of companies deemed a threat to national security, effectively preventing it from doing business with American companies without government approval.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump tweeted that Huawei will be allowed to buy products that do not have an impact on U.S. national security, though he did not reveal exactly where that line might be. The next day, White House economic adviser <a href=""https://www.apnews.com/0768695320954175b1c7a30bbe753c80?cid=eml_dbm_20190701&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BYERS%20MARKET%202019.07.01&amp;utm_term=Byers%20Market"" target=""_blank"">Larry Kudlow said on ""Fox News Sunday""</a> and CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the announcement was not an indication that the U.S. was relieving pressure on Huawei, adding that sales would be allowed for ""general merchandise.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Huawei's emergence as a global tech power — most notably one that is key to the much-hyped creation of the next-generation 5G wireless internet networks — has opened the door to broader questions about how much the U.S. can trust China even as the two countries' tech industries grow further intertwined. China's willingness to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/06/25/chinese-government-suspected-of-major-hack-on-10-global-phone-companies-reports/"" target=""_blank"">engage in cyberattacks</a>, steal intellectual property and exert control over Chinese companies have made Huawei the focus of an existential question: how much should a Chinese company be at the center of important U.S. tech infrastructure?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But it wasn't until Trump launched a trade war with China that Huawei also became a leverage point for Trump, alternately increasing and relieving pressure on the company in order to get larger concessions from China. That has been cause for alarm among politicians and security experts who have recommended a hard line toward the company.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Senators from both parties responded to Trump's move with either words of caution or outright dissension.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""If President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Huawei?src=hash"">#Huawei</a> he has made a catastrophic mistake,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted Saturday, adding that he would pursue legislation to put restrictions back in place.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I would like to see the details, but we need to remember that Huawei represents a threat to our national security,"" Sen.

The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group made up of many tech companies that make crucial tech hardware including the computer chips necessary for modern computing, applauded the move.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The progress made today by President Trump and President Xi [Jinping] in Osaka, Japan, is good news for the semiconductor industry, the overall tech sector, and the world’s two largest economies,"" John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in an emailed statement.

In a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-fundraising.html"" target=""_blank"">memo obtained by The New York Times</a>, her campaign reportedly said that there was “no question” that Gillibrand’s first-quarter fundraising was negatively affect by those “who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Still, in conversations with voters in early primary states, many say they aren’t thinking of Franken when it comes to making a decision on who to support in the primary.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What was interesting about Gillibrand is she immediately wanted to talk about Al Franken and how she responded to that. For me, as much as that is important, it wasn’t what I was super interested in hearing about,” said Emily Van Kirk of Iowa, recalling attending an event with Gillibrand at the beginning of the year. In the early days of her campaign, Gillibrand <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/225028/kirsten-gillibrand-al-franken-sexual-harassment-2020-presidential-race"" target=""_blank"">frequently addressed Franken's resignation</a> in her stump speech.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I am a long way away from picking my candidate, and I will certainly be considering a handful of them, including Gillibrand. That’s why I’m here — so I can get more than just the soundbite,” George Sykes, a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, said at a coffee shop meet-and-greet with Gillibrand earlier this month, adding that he doesn't have an opinion about the Franken resignation. ""I didn’t particularly pay attention to it.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gillibrand says she has backed away from her initial strategy of explaining her thought process on Franken, recognizing that most voters aren’t interested in hearing about him. His name hardly comes up anymore, she said recently.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“No, not really, to be honest,” Gillibrand said in a phone interview with NBC News just ahead of the first Democratic debate last week, when asked if she hears from voters about Franken. “It seems to be something that some elite Democrats, elite Democratic donors, care about. But no, when I am on the campaign trail people ask me about how to get access to health care, they ask me about how they can get better public schools or free college, or how we can get better job training.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Franken could help make sense of Gillibrand's low fundraising numbers from big-dollar donors who once supported her, it still does not fully capture why she has failed to garner more grassroots support and continues to lag behind candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/elizabeth-warren-campaign-donors-1182736"" target=""_blank"">sworn off big donors</a> all together.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The diagnosis for Gillibrand’s campaign headaches is more than just an Al Franken hangover. But many Democratic strategists and party leaders say they're left puzzled.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I just really don’t know. I am kind of at a loss for words right now,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist, as she grappled to explain Gillibrand’s struggling candidacy. “I think her campaign is a little confused, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some party leaders say Gillibrand’s problems started back home in New York. As other Democratic presidential candidates locked down home state support, Gillibrand <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/07/gillibrand-new-york-delegation-2020-1211778"" target=""_blank"">struggled to get endorsements</a> from the New York delegation. Some even <a href=""https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-kirsten-gillibrand-carolyn-maloney-sherrod-brown-joe-biden-beto-orouke-20190206-story.html"" target=""_blank"">publicly questioned</a> the viability of her candidacy.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think that there was some lack of institutional support early on that contributed to a narrative that her run might be more quixotic than others,” said Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist and the former executive director of the New York Democratic Party, adding that this dynamic “contributed to a low enthusiasm with her at the start.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Others say that Gillibrand’s decision to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-president-feminist.html"" target=""_blank"">brand herself as the feminist candidate</a> in the race has fallen flat, especially in a Democratic primary where voters expect all candidates to speak to issues such as women’s reproductive health care and paid family leave.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“She had a very mom-centric launch, which isn't as effective when you are in a race against other moms that are talking about more than just that,” Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist, said in a phone interview with NBC News.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">On the campaign trail, voters echo this sentiment.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Women’s issues are very important to me,” said Cass Olsen, a New Hampshire retiree, after attending a meet-and-greet with Gillibrand. “But they can be — and they are being — addressed by men and other women as well. So I don’t know how it plays out with her. I am still unsure.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And Gillibrand’s stump speech, which is centered around the importance of female representation in politics, has left some progressives with a sour taste in their mouths. Gillibrand, they say, has not always practiced what she preaches.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“She has really advanced the feminist causes throughout the country … but it’s troubling to see that she hasn’t gotten off the sidelines more for women in New York,” said Katz, pointing out that Gillibrand endorsed Gov. Andrew Cuomo and then-Rep. Joe Crowley over their female Democratic challengers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Many voters and party leaders say that what's holding Gillibrand back is lack of exposure. She's had good moments — from launching her campaign outside of Trump Tower to being one of the first candidates to visit Georgia in the wake of the state's near-total abortion ban — but none have managed to stick with the public, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-harris-busing-integration-became-flashpoint-debate-stage-n1024216"" target=""_blank"">the way Kamala Harris grabbed the spotlight</a> when she shared the stage with Gillibrand at last week's Democratic debate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I don’t know how people get the name recognition,” said Karen Zurheide, 63, at a women's health care roundtable with Gillibrand. “A lot of people have gotten a breakout moment and she just has not had that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean McElwee, co-founder of Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, agreed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It’s a really big field and so there are a lot of people not making a dent in the polls,” he said. “It can feel like a vicious cycle: You’re not covered so you don’t move up in the polls, and you don’t move up in the polls so you aren’t covered.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lauren Egan reports for NBC News, based in Washington.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

The authors of the study described five cases of Vibrio vulnificus <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.today.com/health/6-year-old-gets-necrotizing-fasciitis-loses-part-leg-t110145"">necrotizing fasciitis</a> that occurred during the summer of 2017 and 2018. In the eight years before 2017, the doctors saw only one case of the infection.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Fleming, on the other hand, acquired the infection in Florida waters, her family says, where the bacteria are naturally found.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Here’s what you need to know about necrotizing fasciitis:</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Necrotizing fasciitis is a skin infection caused by rare bacteria that enters the body through a break in the skin. From this opening, the bacteria aggressively attacks muscles and other organs resulting in rapid destruction of the tissues. Vibrio bacteria are one group that can cause this infection; one type, called Vibrio vulnificus, is particularly dangerous. It is usually contracted when an open wound comes into contact with <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/three-islands-disappeared-past-year-climate-change-blame-ncna1015316"" target=""_blank"">coastal saltwater</a>. Necrotizing fasciitis can quickly develop soon after. If not treated promptly with antibiotics, the infection can become fatal. But more often, the bacteria are ingested in raw or undercooked seafood, causing diarrhea. The resulting illness is rarely life-threatening and symptoms occur within 24 hours and last about three days.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Group A strep is another type of bacteria that can cause necrotizing fasciitis and severe diarrhea, as well as a system-wide blood infection that leads to severely low blood pressure and multiple organ failure, called streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those with health conditions that weaken the body’s immune system such as:</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“V. vulnificus, which seems to be on the rise, causes human health concerns in the form of blood infection and wound infection. The elderly, those who are immune-compromised, and the very young are at greatest risk,” said Kimberly Reece, chair of Aquatic Health Sciences at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Contact with Group A strep or V. vulnificus rarely leads to infection in healthy teenagers and adults, but anyone with open wounds should avoid swimming pools, hot tubs and natural bodies of water like lakes, rivers, estuaries and oceans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The infection is pretty rare, but Dr. Glenn Morris, director of the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida, says people should be made aware of it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Vibrio vulnificus is a small problem but nevertheless significant. It can cause a nasty cellulitis in a small group of patients,” Morris said. “If you fall into one of these high-risk categories, people should be aware that there are bacteria in the water that can cause serious infections.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/groupastrep/diseases-public/necrotizing-fasciitis.html#treatment"" target=""_blank"">CDC, every year, 700 to 1,200 cases are diagnosed in the U.S.</a>, although the CDC notes that this is likely an underestimate. About 25 percent to 30 percent of those cases result in death.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Necrotizing fasciitis is rarely contagious.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Early symptoms include:</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Later on ulcers or blisters can form, as well as dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. The infection often spreads quickly so it is imperative to seek medical attention if someone is experiencing one or more of these symptoms.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious illness that requires immediate hospital attention.

231,New study shows Russian propaganda may really have helped Trump,33,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/new-study-shows-russian-propaganda-may-really-have-helped-trump-n1025306,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,18,35,politics-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump and his allies have long insisted that Russian's 2016 propaganda campaign on social media had no impact on the presidential election.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a href=""https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/10107/8049"" target=""_blank"">A new statistical analysis says it may well have.</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The study, by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, does not prove that Russian interference swung the election to Trump. But it demonstrates that Trump's gains in popularity during the 2016 campaign correlated closely with high levels of social media activity by the Russian trolls and bots of the Internet Research Agency, a key weapon in the Russian attack.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Our results show that the weeks when Russian trolls were accumulating likes and retweets on Twitter, that activity reliably foreshadowed gains for Trump in the opinion polls,"" wrote Damian Ruck, the study's lead researcher, <a href=""https://theconversation.com/russian-twitter-propaganda-predicted-2016-us-election-polls-119444"" target=""_blank"">in an article explaining his findings</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The study found that every 25,000 re-tweets by accounts connected to the IRA predicted a 1 percent increase in opinion polls for Trump.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In an interview with NBC News, Ruck said the research suggests that Russian trolls helped shift U.S public opinion in Trump's favor. As to whether it affected the outcome of the election: ""The answer is that we still don't know, but we can't rule it out.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Given that the election turned on 75,000 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, ""it is a prospect that should be taken seriously,"" Ruck wrote, adding that more study was needed in those swing states.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He points out that <a href=""%20thirteen%20percent%20of%20voters%20didn't%20make%20their%20final%20choice%20until%20the%20last%20week%20before%20the%20election.%20https:/www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls"">13 percent of voters didn't make their final choice until the last week before the election. </a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruck said the correlation between troll activity and Trump's popularity remained true even when controlling for Trump's own Twitter activity and other variables.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It turns out that the activity of Russian Twitter trolls was a better predictor of Donald Trump's polling numbers than his own Twitter activity,"" he wrote.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruck was among a group of researchers who won a Defense Department grant this year to study Russian disinformation campaigns in Georgia, Ukraine, and Belarus through March 2024.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The researchers found to their surprise that the Russian propaganda did not drive down Democrat Hillary Clinton's popularity, even though much of it was aimed at discrediting her. One factor may have been that the target audience was mostly right-wing media consumers who already disliked Clinton.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The study noted that Trump's own policy proposals occasionally seemed to dovetail with Russian propaganda.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For example, Russian propaganda exploited the December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, California ""to stoke fears about Muslim immigration,"" the study says.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Shortly afterward, <a href=""https://russiatweets.com/author/TEN_GOP/tweets"" target=""_blank"">Trump announced his support of a ban on Muslims entering the United States</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, in April derided the Russian propaganda effort as ""a couple of Facebook ads.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In fact, the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm led by an oligarch close to Putin, conducted ""a vast, coordinated campaign that was incredibly successful at pushing out and amplifying its messages,"" <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/russian-trolls-who-interfered-2016-u-s-election-also-made-n1013811"" target=""_blank"">according to cybersecurity firm Symantec</a>, which conducted an in-depth analysts of nearly 4,000 Twitter accounts involved in what U.S. intelligence agencies assess was a Russian-government–sponsored propaganda operation designed in part to help Trump get elected president.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The IRA's disinformation campaign was described in the final report by special counsel Robert Mueller, and in his indictment of multiple Russian nationals. U.S intelligence agencies assessed that the social media manipulation was part of a Russian intelligence operation designed to undermine American democracy by exacerbating divisions, hurt Clinton and help Trump. Experts say the U.S. government and American social media companies have yet to develop a strategy to prevent such manipulation from happening again. Just last week, a different cybersecurity firm exposed an Iranian effort to manipulate U.S. social media with fake accounts.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The IRA's basic strategy, Symantec found, was to use a small core of Twitter accounts to push out new content. And they harnessed a wider pool of automated accounts to amplify those messages.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We also see that 91 percent of first retweeters of IRA tweets were non-IRA bots,"" the Tennessee study says, ""which suggests that propaganda spread into networks of real U.S. citizens.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Trump administration <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/us/politics/fake-joe-biden-website.html"" target=""_blank"">has not developed a strategy</a> to deal with the social media propaganda that is already cropping up in connection with the 2020 election, and Trump continues to downplay the issue of foreign election interference.

256,Remembering why Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza,58,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/remembering-why-black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-podcast-transcript-ncna1013901,2019-07-01,2019,7,1,18,35,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>“Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive.

U.S. leaders still must confront the unpleasant reality that Pyongyang is unlikely to abandon its <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/29/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-timeline---fast-facts/index.html"" target=""_blank"">modest nuclear capability</a>. Such a deterrent is North Korea’s ace in the hole to prevent the United States from contemplating forcible regime change.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">U.S. leaders must deal with the situation as it is, not as they might wish it would be.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Instead, U.S. leaders must deal with the situation as it is, not as they might wish it would be. North Korea is not going to return to nuclear virginity, whatever the mixture of pressure and incentives it faces. And America’s risk exposure in remaining on the front lines militarily in Northeast Asia has become excessive. Washington requires a new policy that reflects both of those insights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump must move beyond summits and their diplomatic atmospherics regarding North Korea and begin to develop a normal relationship with Pyongyang. That includes a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries and lifting all sanctions on products that do not have a direct military application.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is needed because effective diplomacy must focus on achievable objectives. Continuing to demand that Pyongyang capitulate and accept total denuclearization is pointless. A settlement that limits North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities is attainable, and it would substantially reduce the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula — something that would benefit the United States and global community.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After reducing its own tensions with Pyongyang, the U.S. should hand the baton of regional leadership back to where it belongs: in the region. Washington must inform North Korea’s neighbors that they now need to assume primary responsibility for containing that country.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The long-standing U.S. security shield protecting its allies in Northeast Asia was relatively low risk until the past few years, since the DPRK had no ability to strike the American homeland. That situation is now changing. U.S. intelligence agencies and independent experts believe that Pyongyang might be able to hit sites on America’s West Coast already, and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/22/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons.html"">it won’t be long</a> before long-range North Korean missiles could reach targets throughout the United States. The balance between benefits and risks for Washington to continue shielding Japan and South Korea is shifting dramatically in an undesirable direction.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It is both odd and unnecessary for the United States, located thousands of miles away, to be in charge of policy toward Pyongyang. East Asian countries that have greater interests at stake should have that task. Those countries, especially Japan and South Korea, are serious military powers that could become even more formidable by boosting their defense spending. South Korea has an economy <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2170456/could-hong-kongs-one-country-two-systems-work-korea"">40 to 50 times larger</a> than North Korea’s, and Japan is the world’s No. 3 economic power.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">They clearly can afford to build whatever military forces they deem necessary for their security. The provision in Japan’s constitution supposedly renouncing war would not be a barrier to more effective action, either. Even previous interpretations of that clause allow for a robust self-defense.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although Tokyo and Seoul do not possess nuclear weapons, their sizable, sophisticated conventional arsenals would likely deter North Korea. Given China’s huge economic and political stake in preserving peace in East Asia, Beijing also has a powerful incentive to restrain its sometimes volatile client. The notion that a more limited, low-key U.S. role in Northeast Asia would lead automatically to a successful North Korean orgy of aggression reflects stale thinking and unwarranted panic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Alternatively, the current approach only inflames tensions and encourages North Korea to take a more combative posture, given Pyongyang’s suspicions about American’s planned course of action. Kim Jong Un and his colleagues concluded long ago that Washington will renege on any concessions and eventually try to overthrow their regime. Such suspicions are not unfounded.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korean leaders see how the United States has treated non-nuclear adversaries such as Serbia, Iraq and Syria. They especially absorbed the lesson of what the United States did to Libya <a href=""https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/libya-forgotten-reason-north-korea-desperately-wants-nuclear-weapons"">once Muammar Qaddafi agreed to terminate his nuclear program</a>. They have no desire to leave themselves vulnerable to a similar diplomatic double-cross and forcible regime-change. A nuclear arsenal, even a small one, with a credible delivery system is North Korea’s insurance policy. Kim is not likely to relinquish it, whatever hints to the contrary he may offer during negotiations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump administration actions elsewhere in the world have done nothing to allay Pyongyang’s wariness. In May 2018, Washington abruptly withdrew from the multilateral agreement to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Worse, following the spike in U.S-Iranian tensions in late June, Trump warned Tehran that if war broke out, it would mean Iran’s “<a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/trump-obliteration-iran-nuclear-weapons-pursuit-1376744"">obliteration</a>.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such a dire threat against a non-nuclear power does not create an incentive for Pyongyang to abandon its own deterrent. Instead, Trump’s behavior undermines his own policy of trying to rein in North Korea.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow in security studies at the Cato Institute.

258,Trump's family separation policy never really ended.

Yet relying largely on a technical exception, at least <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">700 more families have been separated</a> since then, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/migrant-children-detention-camps-donald-trump-1445313"">at least five children have died</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In many cases, the separations since then have continued under the guise of fitting into a narrow exception to the order — that the parent <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">poses a danger to the child, or has a serious criminal record or gang affiliation</a>. (The exception <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48776045"">can also be invoked if</a> the parent is sick, or when an aunt, uncle or sibling is accompanying the child.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The government is trying to drive a truck through what was supposed to be a very narrow exception,” <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">notes Lee Gelernt</a> of the American Civil Liberties Union, who believes that the number of separated families <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">will be more than 1,000</a> by the end of this summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Advocates, however, argue that many children are being separated from their parents for minor crimes or questionable, unverified accusations of gang affiliation, neither of which would be allowed to occur to American parents under U.S. law. And so despite the end of the zero tolerance policy, children have continued to be separated from parents only charged with the so-called crime of entering the country illegally, according <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">to the government’s own data</a> released to the Houston Chronicle.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Legally speaking, the zero tolerance and family separation policies are distinct from each other. Family separation refers to the policy of automatically breaking up family units because children cannot be detained in adult detention centers, while “zero tolerance” is an approach to border crossings in which all undocumented immigrants who enter our country through the border with Mexico are automatically referred for criminal prosecution and sent to pretrial jail. <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents""> Child separation</a>, though, is a direct result of zero tolerance, and cannot be ended without truly ending zero tolerance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The children separated from their parents — both in the last year and those yet to be reunited with their parents from before the “end” of family separation — have been placed in unspeakable environments, characterized by a complete loss of human dignity. They reportedly <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/opinions/children-migrant-centers-at-border-long-austin-hillery/index.html"">lack basic hygiene products</a> like toothbrushes and soap in many cases, and are often <a href=""https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43jpjp/flu-lice-and-open-toilets-what-attorneys-saw-at-migrant-child-processing-centers"">covered in lice</a>. Lights are sometimes left on all night (<a href=""https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/doctor-compares-conditions-for-children-at-immigrant-holding-centers-to-torture-facilities"">a known form of torture</a>) and the temperature is regularly <a href=""https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/doctor-compares-conditions-for-children-at-immigrant-holding-centers-to-torture-facilities"">kept so cold </a>that individuals refer to these facilities as “<a href=""https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43jpjp/flu-lice-and-open-toilets-what-attorneys-saw-at-migrant-child-processing-centers"">hieleras</a>,” meaning “ice boxes.” According to a report written by <a href=""https://ktla.com/2019/06/21/everyone-is-sick-kids-held-at-border-patrol-station-in-texas-describe-disturbing-conditions/"">lawyers who visited one facility</a>, “A 2-year-old boy wants to be held all the time,” and so a few girls as young as 10 are trying to take care of him. The report also <a href=""https://ktla.com/2019/06/21/everyone-is-sick-kids-held-at-border-patrol-station-in-texas-describe-disturbing-conditions/"">stated</a> that the child had wet his pants, but had no diapers and was wearing a mucus-smeared shirt. The Clint facility, where some children are held, was built for 106 people, but <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/border-patrol-argues-child-treatment-at-clint-migrant-facility-not-as-described-gives-access-to-texas-station/2019/06/26/69f1b754-9879-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.51a42113a670"">was holding seven times as many children</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And there is still <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">no system</a> in place to reunite parents with their children.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If any parent treated their child the way these children are being treated under the guise of “protection,” they would likely have their child removed from them and face serious jail time. Nevertheless, an attorney for the Trump administration <a href=""https://www.kqed.org/news/11755713/doj-lawyer-sanitary-conditions-for-detained-migrant-children-doesnt-necessarily-mean-providing-toothbrush-and-soap"">recently tried to argue</a> that the way the government is treating these children was adequate to meet the legal requirement for “safe and sanitary” conditions.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The administration claims that separation acts as a form of<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/05/11/610116389/transcript-white-house-chief-of-staff-john-kellys-interview-with-npr""> deterrence</a>, thus reducing illegal border crossings. Yet there is little evidence this policy is having the desired effect: Border arrests, widely seen as a proxy for overall crossings, <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/05/border-arrests-increase-may-1509572"">are at a recent high</a> despite the president’s draconian policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Part of the reason is that most of the families caught up in this administration’s dragnet are fleeing violence or catastrophic natural disasters in their home countries. While en route to America, immigrants faced even more dangers in the form of robbery, being sold into sex or labor trafficking, and even death. They take these risks because of what this country — as the “shining city on the hill” — offers. If they are willing to face these horrors, it seems unlikely that family separation, if they’ve heard of it in advance, serves as a meaningful deterrent.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moreover, even assuming family separation is having some deterrent effect, as a nation, we have long held that children deserve to be protected. In fact, our entire legal system recognizes this moral truth: We ensure that children are not exploited in the workforce through child labor laws; we protect children from predators with a network of sex crime legislation; and we have set different levels of criminal culpability for children based on their youth. Yet when it comes to immigration, these considerations fall apart.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Because of the public outcry over the continued mistreatment, some of the separated children were recently <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/border-migrant-children-detention-soap.html"">moved to a tent facility</a>. However, 100 <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/john-sanders-cbp.html"">were moved back</a> to the original facility amid chaos and confusion — reportedly because this original facility (where children were observed in such deplorable conditions) is better equipped to take care of them than the tents. This mistreatment cannot continue.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Nelson Mandela <a href=""https://www.nelsonmandelachildrensfund.com/news/nelson-mandela-quotes-about-children"">said</a>, “There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Our society’s soul is in grave danger. We are housing thousands of young people — who have committed no crime except traveling with their parents — in unconscionable conditions. What was intolerable a year ago has continued. This time around, we must ensure that we are the ones with zero tolerance — toward any further separations, any more suffering and yet any other death.</p>, <p>Arthur Rizer is a former Department of Justice immigration attorney and served as a law enforcement officer for a decade. Nila Bala is a former public defender from Baltimore City.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

The Constitution is excellent — Democrats and Republicans agree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Well, perhaps not quite everyone. <a href=""https://www.law.miami.edu/faculty/mary-anne-franks"">Legal scholar</a> Mary Anne Franks’ new book “<a href=""https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29075"">The Cult of the Constitution</a>” dissents from this nearly universal enthusiasm. Franks isn't anti-Constitution. But she argues that uncritical reverence for the Constitution leads, not to liberty, but to injustice.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Franks isn't anti-Constitution. But she argues that uncritical reverence for the Constitution leads, not to liberty, but to injustice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""When I say that reverence is a problem, I don't mean in the sense of respect for foundational principles that we're trying to aspire to,"" Franks said. ""What I'm concerned about is reverence that leads us to create an idea of the Constitution based on our intuitions of what we think should be there, rather than what is.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Franks compares constitutional fundamentalism to Biblical fundamentalism. Both, she argues, insist that a text is both infallible and instantly comprehensible while pushing highly contentious interpretations as an excuse to harm others without remorse. ""The combination of reverence and ignorance is at the heart of all fundamentalism,"" Franks writes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The clearest example of constitutional fundamentalism is the extreme rhetoric that has grown up around the Second Amendment. Second Amendment fundamentalists, led by the National Rifle Association, argue that the Constitution must always allow individuals to bear arms, though the text of the amendment is about the right to a well-regulated militia.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Proponents further argue that the supposed right of individuals to carry assault rifles is the one true right that protects all others. People must have guns to defend themselves from government overreach.In this context, any attempt to regulate guns can be presented as an apocalyptic descent into tyranny. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, for example, hinted that it wouldn't be surprising if <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment"" target=""_blank"">gun rights proponents assassinated</a> Hillary Clinton if she is elected president to prevent her infringing on their Second Amendment rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gun fundamentalists, Franks says, tell themselves, ""I carry a gun because it's my constitutional right, and I feel better when I have it and the fact that it makes you uncomfortable and that it <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000500/gun-homicide-place"">objectively makes you less safe</a> is something I just don't care about.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This essentially selfish logic is also a hallmark of First Amendment fundamentalism. Unlike Second Amendment fundamentalism, which is mostly a phenomenon of the right, <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"" target=""_blank"">the First Amendment</a> is embraced and revered across the political spectrum.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Unlike Second Amendment fundamentalism, which is mostly a phenomenon of the right, the First Amendment is embraced and revered across the political spectrum.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nonetheless, Franks says, First Amendment fundamentalism and Second Amendment fundamentalism create similar problems. First Amendment absolutists see it as an absolute right that must always be protected. So, the American Civil Liberties Union defended the right of neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 not just to march, but also to march on <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/14/543462419/charlottesville-violence-highlights-cities-struggle-to-balance-rights-and-safety"">whatever route they wanted, despite the town's safety concerns</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ACLU won. But the result wasn't actually free speech for all. Instead, violence broke out and a white supremacist <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/james-alex-fields-found-guilty-killing-heather-heyer-during-violent-n945186"">murdered a counterprotester</a> named Heather Heyer. Giving neo-Nazis the right to organize and march ended one woman's ability to speak forever.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another example of how First Amendment fundamentalism can go awry is in the realm of campaign finance reform. In the <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205"" target=""_blank"">2010 Supreme Court case Citizens United</a>, the court decided that corporate donations have to be treated as free speech by individuals. This gives the wealthy a huge tool with which to influence elections in their interest. Free speech, though, for the court, trumps concerns about concentration of power, inequality or the integrity of democracy.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Franks argues that we can look to the Constitution itself to puncture constitutional fundamentalism. In particular, she points to the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that government shall not ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" The 14th Amendment, Franks told me, ""means that whatever you think is true about the law or about the status of our rights, it has to be true for everyone.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The First and Second Amendments focus specifically on individual rights. But the 14th for basic legal equality in all areas. First and Second Amendment fundamentalists claim that all other considerations must bow before the right to speech or guns. But the 14th Amendment says that you must consider not just to principles, but consequences. If your right to speech or guns means that, for example, black people are not safe in the streets of your city, that's not acceptable.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The 14th Amendment was, of course, drafted specifically after the Civil War to protect the rights of black people. The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Franks points out, was a meeting of wealthy white men, many of whom were slave owners. They never intended to extend equal rights to everyone; John Adams, as just one example, <a href=""https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/676"">outright mocked his wife</a> when she suggested the convention should include protections for women. The First and Second Amendments were not originally intended for everyone. The Constitution that Abraham Lincoln said should never be interfered with supported slavery. It's only with the 14th Amendment that the Constitution began to protect marginalized people.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Giving greater weight to the 14th Amendment doesn't resolve all constitutional questions, of course. For example, Franks suggests much more aggressive action against websites like Backpage that are accused of facilitating sex trafficking. Sites such as Backpage claim they have a free speech right to publish advertisements for adult services; Franks says that if these ads lead to criminal or harmful activity, the sites should be liable.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But critics of more regulation point out that forcing these websites offline harms sex workers whose <a href=""https://thinkprogress.org/craigslist-erotic-services-platform-3eab46092717/"">homicide rates drop precipitously</a> when they are able to advertise and screen clients online. Franks advocates for limiting free speech rights in this case in order to protect sex trafficking victims. But doing so puts <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/after-the-closure-of-backpage-increasingly-vulnerable-sex-workers-are-demanding-their-rights"">sex workers at risk</a>. Free speech fundamentalism harms marginalized people in some cases. But free speech rights are vital for their protection in others.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, weighing harms and benefits can be difficult. Free speech fundamentalism offers to make things simpler; you just pick one principle and stick by it, ignoring all other concerns. But the 14th Amendment, not to mention common sense and decency, argue that approach is inadequate. Contra Lincoln, the Constitution doesn't magically safeguard our liberties, though it provides some principles that can be helpful in preserving them. We can use the Constitution to create a better country. But constitutional fundamentalism will create a worse one.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and cultural critic based in Chicago.

Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates. AfricanAmericans<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-african-american-community-progress-our-work-far-over"" target=""_blank""> make up more than 40 percent</a> of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite African Americans comprising only 12 percent of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, when HIV stopped being known as a primarily white gay epidemic, it began to feel more and more like an afterthought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist"">“safe spaces.”</a> In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/20/15821858/gay-pride-flag-philadelphia-fight-explained"">black and brown stripe</a> to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia's gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through <a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"">mandatory anti-discrimination</a> training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other<a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"" target=""_blank""> alleged incidents</a> involving racial discrimination.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I experienced many of these <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"">same policies</a> in the Washington D.C. area when I used to live there. Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color. We watch violence occurring at alarming rates in the Black queer community while <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/07/rainbow-capitalism-is-harmful.html"">rainbow capitalism</a> continues to dominate an “inclusion” conversation that never seems to <em>include</em> us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Black queer people are still fighting for survival, white queer people were fighting for marriage equality. This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Asked by a reporter about her trip to the North, she replied, ""Surreal.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Her involvement at the G-20 summit that preceded the trip to the Koreas went viral when the French president’s office released a video of her speaking with French President Emmanuel Macron, the prime ministers of the U.K. and Canada, and the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Her appearances quickly became a talking point in hyper partisan discussion in Washington thousands of miles away.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. responded to the video on Twitter, saying that “being someone’s daughter actually isn’t a career qualification.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The U.S. needs our president working the G-20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn’t hurt either,” she added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But it is not as clear cut as all that, according to former White House staffer Peter Feaver.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As an adviser to the president, Ivanka Trump has not needed to be confirmed by Congress — a role that is unusual but not unprecedented, he said. President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother, Robert Kennedy, as attorney general in the early 1960s.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This seemed to be a moment where she came even further from the margins to center stage,"" said Feaver, who served under President Bill Clinton as director for defense policy and arms control, and as a special adviser on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This more visible role could be a harbinger to a more formal role if Trump is elected to a second term, one that could require a confirmation from Congress, he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""If you're thinking about it in those terms, the more of a public record you can build up of you doing important things responsibly, the better the confirmation hearings would go,"" Feaver added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Prior to her father taking office, Ivanka Trump ran her own lifestyle brand and appeared in his television show, “The Apprentice.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Her lack of formal diplomatic experience fueled a trending hashtag #unwantedIvanka on Twitter and memes with her image inserted into famous historic moments, including the Beatles crossing Abbey Road and the painting “American Gothic.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders struck out at critics of Ivanka Trump.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""President Trump and Ivanka Trump actually created millions of new jobs and continue to make the U.S. stronger on the global stage but thank you for reminding Americans everyday why they elected Trump,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/SarahHuckabee/status/1145503291406729217"" target=""_blank"">she tweeted</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the start of the G-20, Ivanka Trump joined in photos with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, along with her father and husband, Jared Kushner, a fellow senior White House adviser.

On her Instagram, followed by 4.9 million people, and Twitter feed, followed by 6.6 million, she often posts videos and photos of her meetings and travels.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In May, she joined her father on his state visit to the U.K., along with her other siblings, and joined in meetings with top U.S. and U.K. business leaders.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In one of her early trips abroad, to the G-20 meeting in 2017, Ivanka assumed her father’s seat when he left the negotiating table with fellow leaders — a switch captured on camera by a Russian official.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In April, she said that her father had asked if she was <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/ivanka-trump-says-she-passed-world-bank-job-n995556"" target=""_blank"">interested in taking the job of World Bank chief but she passed on it</a>. She said her father raised the job with her as ""a question"" and she told him she was ""happy with the work"" she's doing. Instead, she said she oversaw the process of selecting the final candidate together with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, bringing the president the multiple candidates to approve.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Asked if her father had approached her about other top jobs, Ivanka Trump said she'd ""keep that between"" them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the end of this trip to Asia, Trump brought her on stage to speak after he addressed members of the U.S military at an American air base in Osan, just south of Seoul, South Korea, before ending his Asia trip and returning to Washington.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Flanked by her father and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, she thanked the troops for their service, and posted the image to her Instagram stories. Following that she continued in her role as cheerleader-in-chief, posing an image of the presidential seal with a caption highlighting the president's entrance into North Korean territory on Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Our President is relentlessly pursuing his commitment to make the world a safer place,"" she wrote.

The scientists concluded that aliens are not needed to explain 'Oumuamua, as a natural explanation satisfies the observations. Their study was published today (July 1) in the journal<a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0816-x"" target=""_blank""> Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Our preference is to stick with analogs we know, unless or until we find something unique,"" Knight said. ""The<a href=""https://www.space.com/42352-oumuamua-interstellar-object-alien-light-sail.html""> alien spacecraft hypothesis</a> is a fun idea, but our analysis suggests there is a whole host of natural phenomena that could explain it.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a href=""https://www.space.com/oumuamua.html"">'Oumuamua's</a> rapid speed meant that astronomers had only a few weeks after it was<a href=""https://www.space.com/38580-interstellar-object-spotted-comet-asteroid-mystery.html""> first spotted</a> to collect as much data as possible. Their observations revealed that the object was small and red in color. The object also seemed to have a cigar-like shape and an unusual spin, as well as a strange change in direction that has been a challenge to explain.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The motion of 'Oumuamua didn't simply follow gravity along a parabolic orbit as we would expect from an asteroid,"" Knight said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Jets of gas could gently push the traveler, providing a potential explanation for its change in spin and direction. But astronomers didn't spot any sign of material shooting out of the elongated object that would match current models of <a href=""https://www.space.com/42437-oumuamua-interstellar-object-small-shiny-comet.html"">cometary jets</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Either the jet model in that study did not capture how 'Oumuamua's jets actually worked, or we need to throw the whole jets idea out of the window,"" Sean Raymond, a member of the ISSI team and co-author on the paper, wrote in his<a href=""https://planetplanet.net/2019/07/01/oumuamua-was-it-aliens-spoiler-no/""> blog</a>. ""The alien-spacecraft camp threw the jets model out of the window.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to Raymond, these scientists may have tossed out jets too soon.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""How comets' spins change due to outgassing is an active area of research,"" Raymond wrote. ""And it's more complicated than you might think.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another model suggesting that the cometary object would have lost about 10% of its total mass as it passed the sun reveals a spin that matches what was observed with 'Oumuamua. According to Raymond, that theory may or may not be correct, but it ""clearly shows that comet-like outgassing can explain 'Oumuamua's nongravitational acceleration and spin at the same time.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It's also possible that pressure from solar radiation could have affected the spin. If 'Oumuamua was only a few millimeters thick, it could work as a<a href=""https://www.space.com/lightsail-2-solar-sail-planetary-society-spacecraft.html""> lightsail</a>, pushed along by starlight. But if the interstellar traveler was an alien star sail, it shouldn't have a spin, instead keeping one face constantly pointing towards the sun.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The scientists who suggested that the object could be an alien spacecraft also argued that the lack of similar natural objects in space suggests that 'Oumuamua should never have been discovered, and may therefore have been deliberately aimed at Earth. Similarly, its unlikely orbit sent it closer to Earth than any other planet, a so-called special orbit that suggests it may have sought us out.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Knight and his colleagues argued that, while simulations suggest how much material — roughly one Earth-mass — gets ejected during planet formation, the true amount of debris ejected during these events remains unknown: It could be a few large objects or many smaller ones.<a href=""https://www.livescience.com/64526-interstellar-visitor-oumuamua-not-that-special.html""> Some estimates</a> suggest that roughly two extrasolar objects pass by the sun each year. Knight also pointed out that small, faint objects like 'Oumuamua should constantly breeze through the solar system but are often too faint to be visible. These items can only be spotted when they are near our planet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""'Oumuamua's orbit is completely average when compared with detectable interstellar objects,"" Raymond wrote. ""The ones we could find are mostly on 'special' orbits.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">What about the strange elongated shape of the visitor? ""The thing is, we don't know 'Oumuamua's actual shape,"" Raymond wrote. Researchers only had a limited time to observe the <a href=""https://www.space.com/interstellar-objects-oumuamua-planet-growth.html"">faint fleeing object</a>. While it could look like a cigar, it could also bear a strong resemblance to a pancake.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Even a cigar shape could have a natural explanation. 'Oumuamua could be a fragment of a larger object shredded before it was ejected, a process that stretched it out. Slow collisions with objects in its home system could have produced its bizarre shape. Or the fast-traveling dust between the stars could have crashed into the visitor, carving out an elongated cigar. Or it could be something else entirely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If 'Oumuamua isn't an alien spacecraft, what might it be?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There is no universally accepted answer, but signs point toward 'Oumuamua being similar to<a href=""https://www.space.com/42437-oumuamua-interstellar-object-small-shiny-comet.html""> solar system comets</a>,"" Raymond wrote. Comet-like objects are constantly tossed out of their systems by large planets and passing stars. A full-size comet or a cometary fragment would fit with the appearance and acceleration of 'Oumuamua, according to the researchers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It is possible that some of 'Oumuamua's weirdnesses are simply due to its small size,"" Raymond wrote. He added that the properties of very few similarly sized objects in the solar system are known because their small size and faintness makes them a challenge to observe.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Signs point to 'Oumuamua being a natural object. Maybe something similar to a comet,"" he wrote. ""But no aliens.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As telescope technology continues to increase, astronomers anticipate spotting more interstellar visitors. The <a href=""https://www.space.com/giant-lsst-telescope-name-vera-rubin.html"">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>, currently under construction in Chile, may help to reveal many of these once the instrument sees first light in 2022. While observers won't catch a glimpse of 'Oumuamua again, they will be able to spot other interstellar visitors.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We may start seeing a new object every year,"" Knight said. ""That's when we'll start to know whether 'Oumuamua is weird or common.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If the interstellar visitor resembles other travelers, then it would most likely have similar origins. Only if it was dramatically different from the majority of visitors might scientists begin to consider more fantastic origins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""If we find 10 to 20 of these things and 'Oumuamua still looks unusual, we'll have to reexamine our explanations,"" Knight said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>Follow Nola on </em><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/astrowriter""><em>Facebook</em></a><em> and on Twitter at </em><a href=""https://twitter.com/NolaTRedd""><em>@NolaTRedd</em></a><em>.

281,Fears grow that Trump's foreign aid abortion ban is putting women's lives at risk,16,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-foreign-aid-policies-endanger-women-experts-say-n1018056,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,7,44,world,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">LONDON — Caroline Nyandat will never forget the day she watched a 14-year-old girl die due to complications from an unsafe abortion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nyandat, 36, was then completing her training as a nurse midwife in Kisumu, Kenya, when the teen was in need of surgery but suffered from sepsis before doctors in the hospital could react.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“That's when it struck me that I need to be trained so that I'm able to handle such cases,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That was more than a decade ago, and Nyandat has since become an abortion care provider. Despite the progress she made helping women in Kisumu access safe reproductive health care, Nyandat fears women are returning to dangerous back alleys or at-home methods to terminate pregnancies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Global health campaigners warn that decisions made in Washington are making conditions worse for women around the world and could be responsible for more than half a million unsafe abortions and thousands of deaths each year.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">Marginalized women are the ones who are dying and this gag rule does exactly the opposite of what it should be doing, which is protecting life.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In January 2017, President Donald Trump <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-regarding-mexico-city-policy/"">re-instated the Mexico City Policy</a>, widely referred to as the Global Gag Rule, which prohibits federal funding for the delivery and promotion of abortion care services overseas. While previous administrations applied the rule specifically to family planning and reproductive health spending, Trump expanded its coverage to all U.S. global health assistance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in March this year <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-admin-expands-ban-foreign-aid-abortion-services-n987546"">the policy was expanded</a> again to prohibit the funding of any group that promotes or provides abortion. “American taxpayer dollars will not be used to underwrite abortions,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That policy is now affecting the distribution of nearly $9 billion in U.S. global aid.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over three years, the <a href=""https://www.ippf.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/IPPF%20GGR%20Policy%20Briefing%20-%20January%202019.pdf"">International Planned Parenthood Federation stands to lose $100 million</a> — funding it says would have contributed to preventing 4.8 million unintended pregnancies, 1.7 million unsafe abortions and 20,000 maternal deaths worldwide.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Marie Stopes International, the largest sexual and reproductive health organization in Kenya and a significant operator in 36 other countries around the world, did not agree to the gag rule, which resulted in a shortfall of $50 million in funding this year. It estimates the consequences of service cuts will lead to 1.8 million unintended pregnancies, 600,000 unsafe abortions and 4,600 maternal deaths globally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nyandat is seeing the effects of the policy firsthand working with the Kenyan health and education nonprofit Kisumu Medical and Education Trust — a group that before the changes to the rules was a recipient of U.S. aid.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The fear is women will be denied services, and in that denial, we will push them to the wall where we start having high maternal (mortality) cases because of unsafe abortions,” Nyandat said. “Women will always find an alternative to get this service.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/adding-it-up-contraception-mnh-adolescents-kenya"">About 63 percent of pregnancies in Kenya are unplanned</a> and occur for reasons similar to many other countries — lack of sexual education, social pressures to have sex, early marriage and rape, Nyandat said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Because of the policy, countless women have lost access to emergency contraception — such as the morning-after pill — and the availability of regular contraception has become erratic, Nyandat said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The resulting heightened risks for unintended pregnancies coupled with fear to even ask about abortions because of the perceived stigma will lead desperate women to take matters into their own hands, Nyandat said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Studies on past iterations of the gag rule support her concerns. The <a href=""https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/12/11-091660/en/"">World Health Organization found</a> that in sub-Saharan African countries, rates of abortion were 1.2 times higher and the use of contraception decreased under President George W. Bush’s reinstatement of the policy, compared with the administrations before and after that revoked it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s not just abortion care that is being affected.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A study released this month by the International Women’s Health Coalition found that the policy is having wider implications on women’s health by reducing access to <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-abortion-gag-rule-hurts-aids-fight-advocates-say-n895316"">other health services like HIV treatment</a> and support for gender-based violence — putting women’s lives at risk.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">One program affiliated with Planned Parenthood, which provided girls in Kenya a range of free health services including testing and treatment for malaria and tuberculosis, was forced to shut down, according to Jedidah Maina, a health advocate who contributed to the report.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">The United States remains committed to helping women and their children thrive, particularly in countries where the need is greatest.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Marginalized women are the ones who are dying, and this gag rule does exactly the opposite of what it should be doing, which is protecting life,” said Maina during a conference on women’s equality in Vancouver, British Columbia, this month.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ripple effects from the confusion of navigating health systems as services close to the decline of referrals to abortion-providing organizations — including those that are publicly funded — are being felt even in countries where abortion care is legal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In South Africa, civil society groups providing technical expertise to the government’s review of the public school curriculum fear to mention abortion in case it affects their funding, according to Vanessa Rios, who contributed to the report. It means the gag rule will guarantee the elimination of abortion education, despite that the right to the service is protected under South Africa’s constitution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The policy is really undermining governments’ ability to drive health policies and priorities,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nyandat has similar concerns that the policy will take a toll on young people in Kenya, leaving a gap in their sexual health education that will take years to bridge — even if the policy is revoked. “I think it will take us time to really bring the younger generation back on track … and realize that abortion care services is part of human rights,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The White House directed comment on the gag rule to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which did not directly address criticisms that the policy is contributing to maternal deaths and increased abortion rates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As the world's largest bilateral donor to global health programs, the United States remains committed to helping women and their children thrive, particularly in countries where the need is greatest,” an agency spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The “vast majority” of foreign nongovernmental organizations subject to the policy have agreed to the conditions, the statement said. For those that have refused, “USAID has worked to transition the activities to other highly qualified partners while minimizing disruption of services,” according to the statement.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The spokesperson added that the State Department and USAID are monitoring the policy and a final review of its implementation will be released in the coming months.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But experts say the evidence is clear and they are calling the policy an attack on human rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This is a politics designed to erode the fundamental integrity of women and girls,” said Kate Gilmore, United Nations deputy high commissioner for human rights. “If it was done at the end of a gun, it would be denounced before the International Criminal Court.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gilmore said the policy flies in the face of science and is using faith and belief to craft laws that restrict the right to medicine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What is odd here is this is not a familiar conservative politics. This is something much more noxious,” she said. “This disregard for evidence and for truth is so deeply troubling.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Other international donors, including Canada, Sweden and the Netherlands, have stepped up to bridge the funding gap left by the United States. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in Vancouver on June 4 that the country would increase its funding for sexual and reproductive health care to $700 million by 2023 from $400 million.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This should not be a political issue. These divisions are playing out globally with devastating consequences, and women deserve better,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lawmakers in Washington are also fighting the policy. On June 19, the House of Representatives passed a health spending package that fully repeals the global gag rule while protecting Americans' access to birth control, cancer screenings, testing and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and other aspects of reproductive health care under <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/u-s-judge-washington-state-blocks-new-trump-abortion-rule-n998706"" target=""_blank"">Title X</a>. </p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The legislation still requires the support of the Senate and president.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There are signs of broader support. Another bill aimed to permanently repeal the gag rule, put forward by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., earlier this year <a href=""https://www.shaheen.senate.gov/news/press/shaheen-lowey-lead-bipartisan-bicameral-push-to-permanently-repeal-the-global-gag-rule"">has received bipartisan support</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the changes are far from becoming law, and Shaheen said she’s calling on more Republicans to recognize the “damage” being done.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The Global Gag Rule is … an ill-conceived, shameful policy that’s jeopardizing the health and safety of women and their families in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world,” Shaheen said in a statement to NBC News.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite the evidence and outcry against the policy both at home and abroad, Jonathan Rusk, senior director of policy and advocacy at <a href=""https://pai.org"">PAI</a>, said the Trump administration “doesn’t care” that it has undermined diplomatic relationships and donor priorities.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Instead, the policy plays to the Trump base. “This is about access to contraceptives and the choice that affords women and girls,” Rusk said. “This is, in some cases, the single issue that this base votes on.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In March, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-admin-expands-ban-foreign-aid-abortion-services-n987546"" target=""_blank"">Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced further expansion</a> of the policy to apply to any organization receiving U.S. funds, even if it’s abortion-related services were being separately funded by another entity.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Health workers say the consequences extend beyond funding. Marta Royo, executive director of <a href=""https://profamilia.org.co/"">Profamilia</a> in Colombia, said the gag rule is spreading the anti-abortionist ideology globally, and she and her colleagues are closely watching how the debate unfolds in the U.S. in anticipation of having to pick up the fight at home.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Now we all know where <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hundreds-protest-alabama-abortion-ban-my-body-my-choice-n1007561"">Alabama</a> is ... because we have to learn, we have to try to protect that from happening and replicating in our countries,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Across East Africa, anti-abortionists have become more active, feeling “emboldened” by the gag rule, said Carole Sekimpi, country director of Marie Stopes Uganda.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“They're moving away from just posting videos online,” she said, adding that groups have organized and held meetings to lobby government officials. Staff at clinics and throughout her organization have also reported increased harassment and intimidation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nyandat, the Kenyan nurse midwife, said she’s been personally attacked as well. “I had a scenario where some of my friends actually told me I will be going to hell,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While these incidents have made her question her work, she said she reminds herself of the alternative. “What is worse is leaving a woman to die,"" she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Linda Givetash is a reporter based in London.

289,15-year-old Cori Gauff upsets Venus Williams at Wimbledon,24,https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/07/01/venus-williams-cori-gauff-wimbledon/?cid=eref:nbcnews:text,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,7,44,https:,"[<p>WIMBLEDON, England (AP) — <strong>Coco Gauff</strong> grew up admiring the Williams sisters. Picked up a tennis racket as a little girl because of them. And on Monday at Wimbledon, still just 15, Gauff beat one of them.</p>, <p>Gauff, the youngest competitor to qualify at the All England Club in the professional era, showed the poise and power of a much older, much more experienced player, pulling off a 6-4, 6-4 victory in the first round over <strong>Venus Williams</strong>, who at 39 was the oldest woman in the field.</p>, <p>When it ended, Gauff dropped her racket and put her hands on her head. After a handshake and exchange of words at the net with Williams, Gauff knelt by her sideline chair and tears welled in her eyes. Up in the stands, her father leaped out of his seat.</p>, <p>“Honestly, I don’t really know how to feel. This is the first time I ever cried after a match. Or winning, obviously; I’ve cried after a loss before,” said Gauff, who is based in Florida. “I don’t even know how to explain how I feel.”</p>, <p>This was her third tour-level match; Williams has played more than 1,000. This was Gauff’s first match at Wimbledon, where Williams has played more than 100 and won five titles. By the time Gauff was born in 2004, Williams already had spent time at No. 1 in the rankings and owned four of her seven Grand Slam singles trophies.</p>, <p>“It didn’t really seem real, for a moment,” said Gauff’s father, Corey, between handshakes and slaps on the back and requests for selfies from spectators leaving No. 1 Court. “On the walk to the court, I was walking behind her. She was excited. I was excited. She seemed confident, but I wasn’t sure if it was false confidence or she really was. I just said to her: This match is really magical. Just enjoy it. Your first Wimbledon main draw and you’re on a main court against somebody you looked up to from the beginning.”</p>, <p>It was by far the most anticipated match of Day 1 at the grass-court tournament, but hardly the only upset. Two-time major champion <strong>Naomi Osaka</strong>, who was No. 1 until a week ago, lost 7-6 (4), 6-2 to <strong>Yulia Putinseva</strong>, joining two young members of the men’s top-10, No. 6 seed<strong> Alexander Zverev</strong> and No. 7 seed <strong>Stefanos Tsitsipas</strong>, on the way out.</p>, <p>This one, though, was special, potentially the sort of changing-of-the-guard moment that people could remember for years.</p>, <p>Gauff certainly has the mindset of someone who intends to go far.</p>, <p>“I’ve said this before: I want to be the greatest. My dad told me that I could do this when I was 8. Obviously you never believe it. I’m still, like, not 100 percent confident. But, like, you have to just say things. You never know what happens,” she said. “If I went into this match saying, ‘Let’s see how many games I can get against her,’ then I most definitely would not have won. My goal was to play my best. My dream was to win. That’s what happened.”</p>, <p>How far does she think she can fare this fortnight?</p>, <p>“My goal,” she said, her face expressionless, “is to win it.”</p>, <p>Well, then …</p>, <p>Gauff came into the week outside the top 300 but was granted a wild card by the All England Club to enter qualifying. She rolled through those rounds at a nearby site, knocking off the event’s top seed.</p>, <p>But this was a whole other task.</p>, <p>Gauff was sensational and showed zero signs that the moment or the matchup was too daunting for her. It’s the sort of unusual calm and steady way she has progressed through the various levels of youth tennis, including reaching the U.S. Open junior final at 13 and winning the French Open junior title at 14.</p>, <p>The first set was remarkable: Gauff had 10 winners to only two unforced errors, all the while trading powerful groundstrokes at the baseline with Williams, and never facing a break point.</p>, <p>“The sky’s the limit,” Williams said. “It really is.”</p>, <p>Gauff, who is black, idolized Williams and her younger sister,<strong> Serena Williams</strong>, the first African American women since <strong>Althea Gibson</strong> in the 1950s to win a Grand Slam singles championship.</p>, <p>Serena has said Gauff reminds her of Venus.</p>, <p>After Monday’s match, Gauff said she thanked Venus “for everything she did.”</p>, <p>“I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for her,” said Gauff, who joined the crowd in applauding for Venus as she walked off the court. “And I was just telling her that she’s so inspiring. Like, I always wanted to tell her that. And even though I met her before, I guess now I have the guts to.”</p>, <p>She showed plenty of grit in this match, particularly after getting broken to make it 4-all in the second set. Gauff steadied herself right there, though, breaking right back with a pair of forehand passing shots that drew errant volleys.</p>, <p>And then in the final game, Gauff needed to erase the disappointment of wasting her initial three match points. She did just that, converting her fourth when Venus put a forehand into the net.</p>, <p>Many 15-year-olds might spend an early summer day at the beach or at a mall. This one played a tennis match at Wimbledon against Venus Williams — and won.</p>, <p>“People just kind of limit themselves too much. Once you actually get your goal, then it’s like: What do you do now?” Gauff said. “I like to shoot really high.”</p>, <p><b>WIMBLEDON: <a href=""https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/06/28/2019-wimbledon-mens-draw-bracket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Men’s Draw</a> | <a href=""https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/06/28/2019-wimbledon-womens-draw-bracket/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Women’s Draw</a></b></p>, <p><strong>OlympicTalk is on <a href=""https://apple.news/TpWxoEZkEM5q1LCuelKJyZg"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Apple News</a>.

290,FDA names 16 brands of dog food linked to canine heart disease,25,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-names-16-brands-dog-food-linked-canine-heart-disease-n1025466,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,7,44,health,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sixteen brands of dog food may be associated with a heightened risk of heart failure in dogs, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA isn't suggesting that pet owners stop feeding their dogs the particular brands yet, but some vets are already advising against ""grain free"" foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The FDA is currently investigating more than 500 reports that appear to link dog foods that are marketed as ""grain free"" to canine dilated cardiomyopathy. <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/dog-heart-disease-linked-food-fda-says-n891011"" target=""_blank"">The FDA has been warning about the foods</a> based on peas, lentils or potatoes since July 2018, but the statement released late last week is the first time the agency has identified the <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/news-events/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy"" target=""_blank"">16 brand names.</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The brands are ordered by the number of cases linked to them, which ranged from a high of 67 to 10:</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Most of the reports were associated with dry dog food formulations, but raw food, semi-moist food and wet foods were included. The FDA has not suggested owners change their pets’ diets.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We’re not saying don’t use these brands, we’re just telling pet owners to work directly with their veterinarians because we’re still investigating,” Lindsay Haake, a spokesperson for the FDA, said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the vast majority of cases have been in dogs, there have also been some in cats.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Veterinary cardiologists told NBC News that they aren’t waiting for the FDA investigation to conclude before advising owners to stop feeding the suspect pet foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When a dog comes to us and we learn during the history that it’s on a grain-free diet, we advise switching to a non-grain-free diet,” said Dr. Anna Gelzer, a veterinary cardiologist and an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “There’s no scientifically proven benefit to grain-free foods, so why take a chance?”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a statement, the Pet Food Institute, whose members make 98 percent of U.S. pet foods and treats, said it and its members “have convened nutritionists, veterinarians and product safety specialists for more than a year to better understand whether there is a relationship between dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and diet. PFI agrees with the FDA's statements that this is a complex issue with many factors requiring scientific evaluation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Heart failure is a known issue for larger breeds of dogs, such as Great Danes and German Shepherds, Gelzer said. The breeds most frequently reported to the FDA for the heart disease were golden retrievers, mixed and Labrador retrievers<strong>.</strong></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But recently the condition started showing up in smaller breeds, which is what caught the attention of veterinarians and eventually the FDA.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“For us at Penn, we started to see cases in late 2017 that stuck out as unusual because they were in smaller breeds such as springer spaniels and beagles that you don’t typically see with canine dilated cardiomyopathy,” Gelzer said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Knowing there had been studies showing that diet could play a role in the development of heart disease in dogs, “we started making investigations into what each owner was feeding.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ultimately Gelzer and others found there was a common denominator: grain-free dog foods, which had replaced grains with substitutes such as lentils, peas and chickpeas.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gelzer doesn’t know exactly how the grain-free pet food trend started, but suspects it had to do with consumer demand for what seemed like a healthier alternative.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It didn’t come from the science side,” Gelzer said. “If you think about wolves, they may ingest the contents of ruminant animals they preyed on, so they are certainly capable of eating grain. There’s no scientific reason for going without grain.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Generally when dogs develop a food allergy, it’s to a protein, Gelzer said. So, veterinarians will often switch to a food with a different protein source to treat the problem.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">One of the big problems with DCM is that dogs don’t show symptoms of the disease — lethargy, exercise intolerance, shortness of breath — until they’re very sick, Gelzer said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She points to the example of clients who came in with a very sick dog that was diagnosed with DCM. The family had a second dog that seemed healthy, but because both were eating a grain-free dog food, Gelzer suggested bringing in the second dog to be checked.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">What we don’t know is if [the foods] used in these diets in place of grains are causing the problem. It’s also possible that could be some kind of toxin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When we evaluated that dog, it also had decreased heart function, but it was still subclinical,” she said. “The dog didn’t look abnormal because it was at an early stage.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gelzer isn’t sure what the results will be if those early stage dogs are switched to a different food. “Some get better when the diet is changed,” she said. “Some stay the same and keep the status quo with medications and some die despite changing the diet and getting all the heart medications we can give.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While it’s clear that pet owners are feeding these brands because they “are trying to do what they perceive as the right thing for their dogs, unless the dog has a documented sensitivity to grains, it’s probably not worth the risk at this point to feed these products,” said Dr. Bruce Kornreich, a veterinary cardiologist in the department of clinical sciences at the Veterinary College of Cornell University and associate director of the Cornell Feline Health Center.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What we don’t know is if [the foods] used in these diets in place of grains are causing the problem,” Kornreich said. “It’s also possible that could be some kind of toxin.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Kornreich suggests pet owners switch to a brand “produced by a company with a long-standing history.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If a pet dog is showing any symptoms of the heart condition, including decreased energy, cough or difficulty breathing, the FDA urges owners to contact a vet as soon as possible.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News and Reuters Health.

President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed over the weekend at the G-20 summit in Japan <a href=""105994814"">to not impose new tariffs</a> on each other's goods. A trade deal between the two countries fell through in the beginning of May.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The South China Sea, which is home to more than 200 specks of land, serves as a gateway to global sea routes where approximately $3.4 trillion of trade passes annually.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The numerous overlapping sovereign claims to islands, reefs and rocks — many of which disappear under high tide — have turned the waters into an armed camp. Beijing holds the lion's share of these features with approximately 27 outposts peppered throughout.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In May 2018, <a href=""105165638"">China quietly installed anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missile systems</a> on three of its fortified outposts west of the Philippines in the South China Sea, a move that allows Beijing to further project its power in the hotly disputed waters, according to sources with direct knowledge of U.S. intelligence reports.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to U.S. intelligence reports, the installations mark the first Chinese missile deployments to Fiery Cross Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands. The Spratlys, to which six countries lay claim, are located approximately two-thirds of the way east from southern Vietnam to the southern Philippines.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">By all accounts, the coastal defense systems represent a significant addition to Beijing's military portfolio in one of the most contested regions in the world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The United States has remained neutral — but expressed concern — about the overlapping sovereignty claims to the Spratlys.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Still, the United States and China have disagreed over several issues regarding the South China Sea.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""China does need to have necessary defense of these islands and rocks which we believe are Chinese territory,"" high-ranking Chinese Col. <a href=""105944775"">Zhou Bo told CNBC in June</a>.

Cook said the report does not match reality and fails to understand how Apple's design team actually works.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The story is absurd,"" Cook said in an email. ""A lot of the reporting, and certainly the conclusions, just don’t match with reality.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Cook does not often publicly rebut news reports but he appeared compelled to do so given his frustrations with the article, which said that the company is prioritizing operations at the expense of design.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“At a base level, it shows a lack of understanding about how the design team works and how Apple works,” Cook said. “It distorts relationships, decisions and events to the point that we just don’t recognize the company it claims to describe.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Colleen Schwartz, senior vice president of communications for The Wall Street Journal, said in a statement that the newspapers stands by its reporting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The rebuttal from Cook, who took over the top job at Apple after the death of Steve Jobs, comes as the company is trying to demonstrate that Ive's departure is not a sign of greater troubles.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ive, who was responsible for the look of many of Apple's most iconic products, including the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad and the Apple Watch, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/jony-ive-iconic-designer-behind-apple-s-iphone-leaving-company-n1023486"">announced Thursday</a> that he would leave the company to start his own design firm, though he will continue to work with Apple as a contractor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“While I will not be an employee, I will still be very involved — I hope for many, many years to come,” Ive told the Financial Times. “This just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But on Sunday night, The Wall Street Journal's Tripp Mickle reported that Ive ""had been growing more distant from Apple’s leadership"" in part because he was frustrated with Cook's ""more operations-focused company,” according to several sources familiar with his departure who were not named.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""People in the design studio rarely saw Mr. Cook, who they say showed little interest in the product development process — a fact that dispirited Mr. Ive,"" Mickle reported.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Mr. Ive grew frustrated as Apple’s board became increasingly populated by directors with backgrounds in finance and operations rather than technology or other areas of the company’s core business,"" the report stated.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Apple has in the past decade become one of the world’s most valuable companies, it now faces scrutiny over its ability to continue creating new products that change the way consumers interact with the world. It remains massively profitable, with $30 billion in earnings over the last six months, but analysts have expressed concern over the fact that it hasn't had a major product hit since the iPad, in 2010. (Sales for the Apple Watch and AirPods, while popular, remain relatively small by comparison.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While growth in hardware sales slows, Apple has spent years investing more heavily in software and services. Nevertheless, Ive's departure caused some alarm among analysts who closely watch Apple. Ive and Jobs worked hand in glove to create many of Apple's best products, and he was long seen as one of the most influential figures at the company. Mickle describes him as ""Jobs’s protégé — and Apple’s closest thing to a living embodiment of his spirit.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Responsibility for Apple's future design will now fall to Jeff Williams, the chief operating officer; Evans Hankey, who oversees industrial design; and Alan Dye, who oversees user interface design.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The design team is phenomenally talented,"" Cook told NBC News.

It shows the stark contrast between Antarctica’s record high sea-ice coverage in 2014 and the record lows recorded in 2017.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It was just three years later that we had a record low, which is quite a rapid shift,” Parkinson said. “The magnitude of that decrease from 2014 to 2017 was more than the decrease that has happened in the Arctic over more than 30 years.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But what caused the initial expansion and subsequent speedy retreat remains a mystery. Researchers have some hypotheses, but so far there is no scientific consensus.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some scientists link the puzzling reversal in Antarctic sea ice to the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/good-news-about-ozone-hole-even-better-you-think-ncna835971"" target=""_blank"">ozone hole over Antarctica</a>, Parkinson said. During the 1980s and ’90s, heavy use of aerosol sprays, refrigerants and other products containing compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons thinned the ozone layer in Earth's atmosphere and allowed more warming ultraviolet rays from the sun to reach the planet’s surface. Chlorofluorcarbons were phased out as part of the 1987 Montreal Protocol, helping <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/earth-s-ozone-layer-finally-healing-un-says-ncna931591"" target=""_blank"">restore ozone levels</a> and presumably cooling the ocean and helping raise levels of Antarctic sea ice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Other researchers say the shifting levels of sea ice could represent natural climate patterns.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">One such pattern is <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/el-ni-o-back-it-blame-our-severe-weather-woes-ncna1012526"" target=""_blank"">El Niño</a>, which occurs when changes in the strength or direction of trade winds every two to seven years causes waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean to become unusually warm. Another is the so-called <a href=""http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/adai/papers/DongDai-CD2015-IPO.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation</a>, which every decade or two alters air pressure, sea temperatures and wind direction.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures are warmer than usual, there are shifts in precipitation and shifts in the pattern of winds driven from the tropics,” said Gerald Meehl, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who was not involved with the new study.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Atmospheric shifts tied to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation that lasted from 1999 to 2013 boosted winds at high southern latitudes around Antarctica during this time — a shift that could have reduced the extent of sea ice around Antarctica by pushing it northward. “You have this mechanism where the winds expand the ice out as far as the wind will blow it,” Meehl said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From 2014 to 2016, the <a href=""http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse_for_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/Atmosphere-and-climate/interdecadal-pacific-oscillations.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation shifted again</a>, which may have had the opposite effect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But scientists agreed that more research is needed to better understand the waxing and waning of sea ice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We’ve now got 40 years of data, so we can look more holistically at the interactions between the tropics and the polar regions, the ice and atmosphere,” said Julie Arblaster, an atmospheric scientist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who was not involved with the new study.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers are also keen to understand the impact of rising global temperatures on sea ice. Meehl said climate change has probably amplified natural shifts in sea ice levels but said more data and better climate models will be needed before scientists can fully understand the possible connection.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t have really long records in this region, which makes it difficult,” Arblaster said, adding that four decades actually represented a small window of time. “But the question of how climate change is interacting with natural variability is very much a question that we need to grapple with. So far our understand is that there have been bouts of natural variability that leads to what we’ve seen, but the longer it goes on and the longer sea ice stays at record lows, the question of climate change has to come into this.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Denise Chow is a reporter and editor at NBC News MACH.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Plus, working some of the biggest muscles in the body (the glutes and legs) helps to burn more calories, speed up your metabolism and burn fat. By strengthening your glutes with our monthly plan, you’ll not only feel tighter and more toned, but also more stable with improved balance throughout your whole body.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There are three major muscles in your glutes — the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus — that work together to rotate, abduct and extend the hip. Fun fact: They’re also the largest and strongest muscles in the body.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When we build and tone the muscles of the butt (plus add in cardio), we’re not only building sleek muscle, but also burning fat and calories, and both of these things work as a one-two punch to building a more toned backside.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">To help you tone the glutes from every angle, we’ve broken down our monthly routine into three exercise banks: standing exercises, modified plank exercises and floor exercises. Each of these three positions provides options for working the muscles in various planes of motion to effectively work the entire glute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the glutes and legs are large muscles, it’s recommended to perform these exercises every other day (rather than doing the standing glute exercises today and then the lying down exercises tomorrow.) In between, take a day off from working your lower body and do something else like cardio from our <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/30-day-walk-run-interval-training-plan-no-gym-required-ncna1010136"" target=""_blank"">walking plan</a> or abdominals from our <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/31-day-abdominal-workout-plan-summer-ncna1000226"" target=""_blank"">abs plan</a>.

Bend the back knee towards the ground as you bend the front knee tracking over the ankle. From here, press down through the front foot’s heel and pull the back knee up and forward towards your chest. Work the standing leg glute even more with an added squeeze at the top as the opposite knee comes up and through. Step the knee back and lower the foot back down, and repeat 10 times. Switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing upright, step your left leg out to the side and bend the left knee into a halfway side lunge. Press off through the left heel and bring the leg and knee back to center. Lift the knee up towards your chest as you squeeze your right glute and press down through the right heel. Repeat 10 times on this side and then switch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing upright, balance on the right foot. Extend the left leg behind you, and lean forward as you lift the left leg up behind you until it is parallel to the floor. Keep the leg straight and squeeze the left glute at the top. Then lower the leg back down towards the ground and bring your torso up to center. Repeat 10 times, then switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Step to the right and bend the right knee. From this side lunge, lift the left leg up and pulse it up as high as your hip, then tap it back down to the ground. Repeat this 10 times, and then switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees and sit your glutes back as if you’re sitting into a chair. Pull your naval in towards your spine and make sure your knees aren’t going forward past your toes. Then press down through the heels to stand back up while squeezing your glutes. Repeat this 10 times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">With your naval pulling in on your hands and knees, extend the right leg behind you. Lift the leg up as high as your hips, then tap it to the right. Lift it back up and bring it back to center. Lift and tap 10 times, then switch legs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">On your hands and knees, lift your right knee off the ground and pull your right heel towards your right glute creating a 90-degree angle. Push your right foot up towards the ceiling to engage the back of the leg and glute, and then release it back down to the starting position. Repeat 10 times, then switch legs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From hands and knees, lift the right knee off of the ground. Open the right knee to the right (as if you’re a doggy lifting your leg up to urinate!). Then bring it back towards center. Repeat this 10 times, then switch to the left leg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Perform the exercise above, except instead of coming back to center, press the leg straight on a diagonal. Then bring it back to the fire hydrant position, and back to center. Repeat 10 times on the right, and then switch to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lying on your side, with your legs stacked on top of each other, lift your right leg up towards the ceiling, and then lower it back down. Slowly do this so that you feel the outer hip and glute engaging. Lift and lower 10 times, then repeat on the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">From the above position, lift the top so that your legs are not touching (about a foot above the bottom leg) and draw circles with your leg. Draw ten circles to the front, than reverse and draw ten towards the back. Switch sides.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lying on your side with your top leg elevated, bend your right knee in towards your chest, then extend if out towards the front as if you’re pushing down on a bike pedal, press the leg back straight, and then bend the knee back in towards the chest.

For Huawei, the two are not mutually exclusive.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">President Donald Trump announced Saturday that the Chinese telecom giant, which became one of the major pivot points of the trade negotiations between the United States and China, would be free to buy some products from U.S. tech companies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The announcement was a change of course for the U.S., which in late May <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-ban-chinese-telecom-giant-huawei-could-cut-rural-n1010311"" target=""_blank"">added Huawei to a list </a>of companies deemed a threat to national security, effectively preventing it from doing business with American companies without government approval.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump tweeted that Huawei will be allowed to buy products that do not have an impact on U.S. national security, though he did not reveal exactly where that line might be. The next day, White House economic adviser <a href=""https://www.apnews.com/0768695320954175b1c7a30bbe753c80?cid=eml_dbm_20190701&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=BYERS%20MARKET%202019.07.01&amp;utm_term=Byers%20Market"" target=""_blank"">Larry Kudlow said on ""Fox News Sunday""</a> and CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that the announcement was not an indication that the U.S. was relieving pressure on Huawei, adding that sales would be allowed for ""general merchandise.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Huawei's emergence as a global tech power — most notably one that is key to the much-hyped creation of the next-generation 5G wireless internet networks — has opened the door to broader questions about how much the U.S. can trust China even as the two countries' tech industries grow further intertwined. China's willingness to <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/06/25/chinese-government-suspected-of-major-hack-on-10-global-phone-companies-reports/"" target=""_blank"">engage in cyberattacks</a>, steal intellectual property and exert control over Chinese companies have made Huawei the focus of an existential question: how much should a Chinese company be at the center of important U.S. tech infrastructure?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But it wasn't until Trump launched a trade war with China that Huawei also became a leverage point for Trump, alternately increasing and relieving pressure on the company in order to get larger concessions from China. That has been cause for alarm among politicians and security experts who have recommended a hard line toward the company.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Senators from both parties responded to Trump's move with either words of caution or outright dissension.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""If President Trump has agreed to reverse recent sanctions against <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Huawei?src=hash"">#Huawei</a> he has made a catastrophic mistake,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted Saturday, adding that he would pursue legislation to put restrictions back in place.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I would like to see the details, but we need to remember that Huawei represents a threat to our national security,"" Sen.

The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group made up of many tech companies that make crucial tech hardware including the computer chips necessary for modern computing, applauded the move.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The progress made today by President Trump and President Xi [Jinping] in Osaka, Japan, is good news for the semiconductor industry, the overall tech sector, and the world’s two largest economies,"" John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in an emailed statement.

But some high-powered <a href=""https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donor-shunned-gillibrand-over-franken-backs-kamala-harris_n_5c5864ebe4b09293b206cfe1"" target=""_blank"">donors</a> and party heavyweights, whose opinion tends to play an outsize role at this stage of the primary, have not moved past Franken's 2017 resignation. Gillibrand herself, at times, has seemingly been at pains to do so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After Gillibrand became the first senator to publicly call for Franken to step down, setting off a wave of over two dozen other Democratic senators to also call for his resignation, many elite donors who had once supported her hesitated. Some said they <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/26/al-franken-kirsten-gillibrand-2020-1014697"" target=""_blank"">viewed Gillibrand’s actions as opportunistic and self-serving</a>, especially as the presidential election neared.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For months, the common explanation about why the high-profile senator from New York long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party has failed to break through in the presidential primary has centered around this dynamic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Many political insiders have viewed Gillibrand’s low fundraising and polling numbers — she hovers at <a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html"" target=""_blank"">a half percent in polling averages</a> — as evidence of a backlash. Democratic voters and donors, the thinking goes, were upset after Gillibrand became the first senator to publicly pressure <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/al-franken-satirist-turned-senator-resign-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations-n825576"" target=""_blank"">Franken to resign</a> after multiple women accused him of inappropriate behavior.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gillibrand’s campaign itself used Franken as a scapegoat to explain why she was raising significantly less as a presidential candidate than she did in her Senate re-election race last year. In a <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-fundraising.html"" target=""_blank"">memo obtained by The New York Times</a>, her campaign reportedly said that there was “no question” that Gillibrand’s first-quarter fundraising was negatively affect by those “who continue to punish Kirsten for standing up for her values and for women.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Still, in conversations with voters in early primary states, many say they aren’t thinking of Franken when it comes to making a decision on who to support in the primary.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What was interesting about Gillibrand is she immediately wanted to talk about Al Franken and how she responded to that. For me, as much as that is important, it wasn’t what I was super interested in hearing about,” said Emily Van Kirk of Iowa, recalling attending an event with Gillibrand at the beginning of the year. In the early days of her campaign, Gillibrand <a href=""https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/02/225028/kirsten-gillibrand-al-franken-sexual-harassment-2020-presidential-race"" target=""_blank"">frequently addressed Franken's resignation</a> in her stump speech.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I am a long way away from picking my candidate, and I will certainly be considering a handful of them, including Gillibrand. That’s why I’m here — so I can get more than just the soundbite,” George Sykes, a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, said at a coffee shop meet-and-greet with Gillibrand earlier this month, adding that he doesn't have an opinion about the Franken resignation. ""I didn’t particularly pay attention to it.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gillibrand says she has backed away from her initial strategy of explaining her thought process on Franken, recognizing that most voters aren’t interested in hearing about him. His name hardly comes up anymore, she said recently.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“No, not really, to be honest,” Gillibrand said in a phone interview with NBC News just ahead of the first Democratic debate last week, when asked if she hears from voters about Franken. “It seems to be something that some elite Democrats, elite Democratic donors, care about. But no, when I am on the campaign trail people ask me about how to get access to health care, they ask me about how they can get better public schools or free college, or how we can get better job training.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Franken could help make sense of Gillibrand's low fundraising numbers from big-dollar donors who once supported her, it still does not fully capture why she has failed to garner more grassroots support and continues to lag behind candidates such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/elizabeth-warren-campaign-donors-1182736"" target=""_blank"">sworn off big donors</a> all together.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The diagnosis for Gillibrand’s campaign headaches is more than just an Al Franken hangover. But many Democratic strategists and party leaders say they're left puzzled.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I just really don’t know. I am kind of at a loss for words right now,” said Adrienne Elrod, a Democratic strategist, as she grappled to explain Gillibrand’s struggling candidacy. “I think her campaign is a little confused, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some party leaders say Gillibrand’s problems started back home in New York. As other Democratic presidential candidates locked down home state support, Gillibrand <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/07/gillibrand-new-york-delegation-2020-1211778"" target=""_blank"">struggled to get endorsements</a> from the New York delegation. Some even <a href=""https://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-pol-kirsten-gillibrand-carolyn-maloney-sherrod-brown-joe-biden-beto-orouke-20190206-story.html"" target=""_blank"">publicly questioned</a> the viability of her candidacy.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think that there was some lack of institutional support early on that contributed to a narrative that her run might be more quixotic than others,” said Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist and the former executive director of the New York Democratic Party, adding that this dynamic “contributed to a low enthusiasm with her at the start.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Others say that Gillibrand’s decision to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-president-feminist.html"" target=""_blank"">brand herself as the feminist candidate</a> in the race has fallen flat, especially in a Democratic primary where voters expect all candidates to speak to issues such as women’s reproductive health care and paid family leave.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“She had a very mom-centric launch, which isn't as effective when you are in a race against other moms that are talking about more than just that,” Rebecca Katz, a New York-based Democratic strategist, said in a phone interview with NBC News.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">On the campaign trail, voters echo this sentiment.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Women’s issues are very important to me,” said Cass Olsen, a New Hampshire retiree, after attending a meet-and-greet with Gillibrand. “But they can be — and they are being — addressed by men and other women as well. So I don’t know how it plays out with her. I am still unsure.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And Gillibrand’s stump speech, which is centered around the importance of female representation in politics, has left some progressives with a sour taste in their mouths. Gillibrand, they say, has not always practiced what she preaches.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“She has really advanced the feminist causes throughout the country … but it’s troubling to see that she hasn’t gotten off the sidelines more for women in New York,” said Katz, pointing out that Gillibrand endorsed Gov. Andrew Cuomo and then-Rep. Joe Crowley over their female Democratic challengers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Many voters and party leaders say that what's holding Gillibrand back is lack of exposure. She's had good moments — from launching her campaign outside of Trump Tower to being one of the first candidates to visit Georgia in the wake of the state's near-total abortion ban — but none have managed to stick with the public, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-harris-busing-integration-became-flashpoint-debate-stage-n1024216"" target=""_blank"">the way Kamala Harris grabbed the spotlight</a> when she shared the stage with Gillibrand at last week's Democratic debate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I don’t know how people get the name recognition,” said Karen Zurheide, 63, at a women's health care roundtable with Gillibrand. “A lot of people have gotten a breakout moment and she just has not had that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean McElwee, co-founder of Data for Progress, a progressive think tank, agreed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It’s a really big field and so there are a lot of people not making a dent in the polls,” he said. “It can feel like a vicious cycle: You’re not covered so you don’t move up in the polls, and you don’t move up in the polls so you aren’t covered.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lauren Egan reports for NBC News, based in Washington.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

323,Remembering why Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza,58,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/remembering-why-black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-podcast-transcript-ncna1013901,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,7,44,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>“Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me.

He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent.

U.S. leaders still must confront the unpleasant reality that Pyongyang is unlikely to abandon its <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/29/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-timeline---fast-facts/index.html"" target=""_blank"">modest nuclear capability</a>. Such a deterrent is North Korea’s ace in the hole to prevent the United States from contemplating forcible regime change.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">U.S. leaders must deal with the situation as it is, not as they might wish it would be.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Instead, U.S. leaders must deal with the situation as it is, not as they might wish it would be. North Korea is not going to return to nuclear virginity, whatever the mixture of pressure and incentives it faces. And America’s risk exposure in remaining on the front lines militarily in Northeast Asia has become excessive. Washington requires a new policy that reflects both of those insights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump must move beyond summits and their diplomatic atmospherics regarding North Korea and begin to develop a normal relationship with Pyongyang. That includes a peace treaty formally ending the Korean War, establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries and lifting all sanctions on products that do not have a direct military application.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is needed because effective diplomacy must focus on achievable objectives. Continuing to demand that Pyongyang capitulate and accept total denuclearization is pointless. A settlement that limits North Korea’s nuclear and missile capabilities is attainable, and it would substantially reduce the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula — something that would benefit the United States and global community.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After reducing its own tensions with Pyongyang, the U.S. should hand the baton of regional leadership back to where it belongs: in the region. Washington must inform North Korea’s neighbors that they now need to assume primary responsibility for containing that country.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The long-standing U.S. security shield protecting its allies in Northeast Asia was relatively low risk until the past few years, since the DPRK had no ability to strike the American homeland. That situation is now changing. U.S. intelligence agencies and independent experts believe that Pyongyang might be able to hit sites on America’s West Coast already, and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/22/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-weapons.html"">it won’t be long</a> before long-range North Korean missiles could reach targets throughout the United States. The balance between benefits and risks for Washington to continue shielding Japan and South Korea is shifting dramatically in an undesirable direction.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It is both odd and unnecessary for the United States, located thousands of miles away, to be in charge of policy toward Pyongyang. East Asian countries that have greater interests at stake should have that task. Those countries, especially Japan and South Korea, are serious military powers that could become even more formidable by boosting their defense spending. South Korea has an economy <a href=""https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2170456/could-hong-kongs-one-country-two-systems-work-korea"">40 to 50 times larger</a> than North Korea’s, and Japan is the world’s No. 3 economic power.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">They clearly can afford to build whatever military forces they deem necessary for their security. The provision in Japan’s constitution supposedly renouncing war would not be a barrier to more effective action, either. Even previous interpretations of that clause allow for a robust self-defense.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although Tokyo and Seoul do not possess nuclear weapons, their sizable, sophisticated conventional arsenals would likely deter North Korea. Given China’s huge economic and political stake in preserving peace in East Asia, Beijing also has a powerful incentive to restrain its sometimes volatile client. The notion that a more limited, low-key U.S. role in Northeast Asia would lead automatically to a successful North Korean orgy of aggression reflects stale thinking and unwarranted panic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Alternatively, the current approach only inflames tensions and encourages North Korea to take a more combative posture, given Pyongyang’s suspicions about American’s planned course of action. Kim Jong Un and his colleagues concluded long ago that Washington will renege on any concessions and eventually try to overthrow their regime. Such suspicions are not unfounded.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korean leaders see how the United States has treated non-nuclear adversaries such as Serbia, Iraq and Syria. They especially absorbed the lesson of what the United States did to Libya <a href=""https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/libya-forgotten-reason-north-korea-desperately-wants-nuclear-weapons"">once Muammar Qaddafi agreed to terminate his nuclear program</a>. They have no desire to leave themselves vulnerable to a similar diplomatic double-cross and forcible regime-change. A nuclear arsenal, even a small one, with a credible delivery system is North Korea’s insurance policy. Kim is not likely to relinquish it, whatever hints to the contrary he may offer during negotiations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump administration actions elsewhere in the world have done nothing to allay Pyongyang’s wariness. In May 2018, Washington abruptly withdrew from the multilateral agreement to contain Iran’s nuclear program. Worse, following the spike in U.S-Iranian tensions in late June, Trump warned Tehran that if war broke out, it would mean Iran’s “<a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/23/trump-obliteration-iran-nuclear-weapons-pursuit-1376744"">obliteration</a>.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such a dire threat against a non-nuclear power does not create an incentive for Pyongyang to abandon its own deterrent. Instead, Trump’s behavior undermines his own policy of trying to rein in North Korea.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow in security studies at the Cato Institute.

325,Trump's family separation policy never really ended. This is why.,60,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-family-separation-policy-never-really-ended-why-ncna1025376,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,7,44,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">President Donald Trump signed an<a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/affording-congress-opportunity-address-family-separation/""> executive order</a> last June ostensibly ending zero tolerance and family separations at the border and promising to reunite almost<a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php""> 3,000 children</a> with their parents. Yet relying largely on a technical exception, at least <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">700 more families have been separated</a> since then, and <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/migrant-children-detention-camps-donald-trump-1445313"">at least five children have died</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In many cases, the separations since then have continued under the guise of fitting into a narrow exception to the order — that the parent <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">poses a danger to the child, or has a serious criminal record or gang affiliation</a>. (The exception <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48776045"">can also be invoked if</a> the parent is sick, or when an aunt, uncle or sibling is accompanying the child.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The government is trying to drive a truck through what was supposed to be a very narrow exception,” <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">notes Lee Gelernt</a> of the American Civil Liberties Union, who believes that the number of separated families <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">will be more than 1,000</a> by the end of this summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Advocates, however, argue that many children are being separated from their parents for minor crimes or questionable, unverified accusations of gang affiliation, neither of which would be allowed to occur to American parents under U.S. law. And so despite the end of the zero tolerance policy, children have continued to be separated from parents only charged with the so-called crime of entering the country illegally, according <a href=""https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Trump-administration-still-separating-hundreds-of-14029494.php"">to the government’s own data</a> released to the Houston Chronicle.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Legally speaking, the zero tolerance and family separation policies are distinct from each other. Family separation refers to the policy of automatically breaking up family units because children cannot be detained in adult detention centers, while “zero tolerance” is an approach to border crossings in which all undocumented immigrants who enter our country through the border with Mexico are automatically referred for criminal prosecution and sent to pretrial jail. <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2018/6/11/17443198/children-immigrant-families-separated-parents""> Child separation</a>, though, is a direct result of zero tolerance, and cannot be ended without truly ending zero tolerance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The children separated from their parents — both in the last year and those yet to be reunited with their parents from before the “end” of family separation — have been placed in unspeakable environments, characterized by a complete loss of human dignity. They reportedly <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/opinions/children-migrant-centers-at-border-long-austin-hillery/index.html"">lack basic hygiene products</a> like toothbrushes and soap in many cases, and are often <a href=""https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43jpjp/flu-lice-and-open-toilets-what-attorneys-saw-at-migrant-child-processing-centers"">covered in lice</a>. Lights are sometimes left on all night (<a href=""https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/doctor-compares-conditions-for-children-at-immigrant-holding-centers-to-torture-facilities"">a known form of torture</a>) and the temperature is regularly <a href=""https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/national/doctor-compares-conditions-for-children-at-immigrant-holding-centers-to-torture-facilities"">kept so cold </a>that individuals refer to these facilities as “<a href=""https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43jpjp/flu-lice-and-open-toilets-what-attorneys-saw-at-migrant-child-processing-centers"">hieleras</a>,” meaning “ice boxes.” According to a report written by <a href=""https://ktla.com/2019/06/21/everyone-is-sick-kids-held-at-border-patrol-station-in-texas-describe-disturbing-conditions/"">lawyers who visited one facility</a>, “A 2-year-old boy wants to be held all the time,” and so a few girls as young as 10 are trying to take care of him. The report also <a href=""https://ktla.com/2019/06/21/everyone-is-sick-kids-held-at-border-patrol-station-in-texas-describe-disturbing-conditions/"">stated</a> that the child had wet his pants, but had no diapers and was wearing a mucus-smeared shirt. The Clint facility, where some children are held, was built for 106 people, but <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/border-patrol-argues-child-treatment-at-clint-migrant-facility-not-as-described-gives-access-to-texas-station/2019/06/26/69f1b754-9879-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.51a42113a670"">was holding seven times as many children</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And there is still <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html"">no system</a> in place to reunite parents with their children.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If any parent treated their child the way these children are being treated under the guise of “protection,” they would likely have their child removed from them and face serious jail time. Nevertheless, an attorney for the Trump administration <a href=""https://www.kqed.org/news/11755713/doj-lawyer-sanitary-conditions-for-detained-migrant-children-doesnt-necessarily-mean-providing-toothbrush-and-soap"">recently tried to argue</a> that the way the government is treating these children was adequate to meet the legal requirement for “safe and sanitary” conditions.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The administration claims that separation acts as a form of<a href=""https://www.npr.org/2018/05/11/610116389/transcript-white-house-chief-of-staff-john-kellys-interview-with-npr""> deterrence</a>, thus reducing illegal border crossings. Yet there is little evidence this policy is having the desired effect: Border arrests, widely seen as a proxy for overall crossings, <a href=""https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/05/border-arrests-increase-may-1509572"">are at a recent high</a> despite the president’s draconian policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Part of the reason is that most of the families caught up in this administration’s dragnet are fleeing violence or catastrophic natural disasters in their home countries. While en route to America, immigrants faced even more dangers in the form of robbery, being sold into sex or labor trafficking, and even death. They take these risks because of what this country — as the “shining city on the hill” — offers. If they are willing to face these horrors, it seems unlikely that family separation, if they’ve heard of it in advance, serves as a meaningful deterrent.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moreover, even assuming family separation is having some deterrent effect, as a nation, we have long held that children deserve to be protected. In fact, our entire legal system recognizes this moral truth: We ensure that children are not exploited in the workforce through child labor laws; we protect children from predators with a network of sex crime legislation; and we have set different levels of criminal culpability for children based on their youth. Yet when it comes to immigration, these considerations fall apart.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Because of the public outcry over the continued mistreatment, some of the separated children were recently <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/border-migrant-children-detention-soap.html"">moved to a tent facility</a>. However, 100 <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/john-sanders-cbp.html"">were moved back</a> to the original facility amid chaos and confusion — reportedly because this original facility (where children were observed in such deplorable conditions) is better equipped to take care of them than the tents. This mistreatment cannot continue.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Nelson Mandela <a href=""https://www.nelsonmandelachildrensfund.com/news/nelson-mandela-quotes-about-children"">said</a>, “There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.” Our society’s soul is in grave danger. We are housing thousands of young people — who have committed no crime except traveling with their parents — in unconscionable conditions. What was intolerable a year ago has continued. This time around, we must ensure that we are the ones with zero tolerance — toward any further separations, any more suffering and yet any other death.</p>, <p>Arthur Rizer is a former Department of Justice immigration attorney and served as a law enforcement officer for a decade. Nila Bala is a former public defender from Baltimore City.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

The Constitution is excellent — Democrats and Republicans agree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Well, perhaps not quite everyone. <a href=""https://www.law.miami.edu/faculty/mary-anne-franks"">Legal scholar</a> Mary Anne Franks’ new book “<a href=""https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=29075"">The Cult of the Constitution</a>” dissents from this nearly universal enthusiasm. Franks isn't anti-Constitution. But she argues that uncritical reverence for the Constitution leads, not to liberty, but to injustice.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Franks isn't anti-Constitution. But she argues that uncritical reverence for the Constitution leads, not to liberty, but to injustice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""When I say that reverence is a problem, I don't mean in the sense of respect for foundational principles that we're trying to aspire to,"" Franks said. ""What I'm concerned about is reverence that leads us to create an idea of the Constitution based on our intuitions of what we think should be there, rather than what is.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Franks compares constitutional fundamentalism to Biblical fundamentalism. Both, she argues, insist that a text is both infallible and instantly comprehensible while pushing highly contentious interpretations as an excuse to harm others without remorse. ""The combination of reverence and ignorance is at the heart of all fundamentalism,"" Franks writes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The clearest example of constitutional fundamentalism is the extreme rhetoric that has grown up around the Second Amendment. Second Amendment fundamentalists, led by the National Rifle Association, argue that the Constitution must always allow individuals to bear arms, though the text of the amendment is about the right to a well-regulated militia.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Proponents further argue that the supposed right of individuals to carry assault rifles is the one true right that protects all others. People must have guns to defend themselves from government overreach.In this context, any attempt to regulate guns can be presented as an apocalyptic descent into tyranny. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, for example, hinted that it wouldn't be surprising if <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/09/trump-gun-owners-clinton-judges-second-amendment"" target=""_blank"">gun rights proponents assassinated</a> Hillary Clinton if she is elected president to prevent her infringing on their Second Amendment rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gun fundamentalists, Franks says, tell themselves, ""I carry a gun because it's my constitutional right, and I feel better when I have it and the fact that it makes you uncomfortable and that it <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2015/10/1/18000500/gun-homicide-place"">objectively makes you less safe</a> is something I just don't care about.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This essentially selfish logic is also a hallmark of First Amendment fundamentalism. Unlike Second Amendment fundamentalism, which is mostly a phenomenon of the right, <a href=""https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment"" target=""_blank"">the First Amendment</a> is embraced and revered across the political spectrum.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Unlike Second Amendment fundamentalism, which is mostly a phenomenon of the right, the First Amendment is embraced and revered across the political spectrum.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nonetheless, Franks says, First Amendment fundamentalism and Second Amendment fundamentalism create similar problems. First Amendment absolutists see it as an absolute right that must always be protected. So, the American Civil Liberties Union defended the right of neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 not just to march, but also to march on <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/14/543462419/charlottesville-violence-highlights-cities-struggle-to-balance-rights-and-safety"">whatever route they wanted, despite the town's safety concerns</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ACLU won. But the result wasn't actually free speech for all. Instead, violence broke out and a white supremacist <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/james-alex-fields-found-guilty-killing-heather-heyer-during-violent-n945186"">murdered a counterprotester</a> named Heather Heyer. Giving neo-Nazis the right to organize and march ended one woman's ability to speak forever.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another example of how First Amendment fundamentalism can go awry is in the realm of campaign finance reform. In the <a href=""https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205"" target=""_blank"">2010 Supreme Court case Citizens United</a>, the court decided that corporate donations have to be treated as free speech by individuals. This gives the wealthy a huge tool with which to influence elections in their interest. Free speech, though, for the court, trumps concerns about concentration of power, inequality or the integrity of democracy.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Franks argues that we can look to the Constitution itself to puncture constitutional fundamentalism. In particular, she points to the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that government shall not ""deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" The 14th Amendment, Franks told me, ""means that whatever you think is true about the law or about the status of our rights, it has to be true for everyone.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The First and Second Amendments focus specifically on individual rights. But the 14th for basic legal equality in all areas. First and Second Amendment fundamentalists claim that all other considerations must bow before the right to speech or guns. But the 14th Amendment says that you must consider not just to principles, but consequences. If your right to speech or guns means that, for example, black people are not safe in the streets of your city, that's not acceptable.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The 14th Amendment was, of course, drafted specifically after the Civil War to protect the rights of black people. The Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Franks points out, was a meeting of wealthy white men, many of whom were slave owners. They never intended to extend equal rights to everyone; John Adams, as just one example, <a href=""https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/676"">outright mocked his wife</a> when she suggested the convention should include protections for women. The First and Second Amendments were not originally intended for everyone. The Constitution that Abraham Lincoln said should never be interfered with supported slavery. It's only with the 14th Amendment that the Constitution began to protect marginalized people.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Giving greater weight to the 14th Amendment doesn't resolve all constitutional questions, of course. For example, Franks suggests much more aggressive action against websites like Backpage that are accused of facilitating sex trafficking. Sites such as Backpage claim they have a free speech right to publish advertisements for adult services; Franks says that if these ads lead to criminal or harmful activity, the sites should be liable.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But critics of more regulation point out that forcing these websites offline harms sex workers whose <a href=""https://thinkprogress.org/craigslist-erotic-services-platform-3eab46092717/"">homicide rates drop precipitously</a> when they are able to advertise and screen clients online. Franks advocates for limiting free speech rights in this case in order to protect sex trafficking victims. But doing so puts <a href=""https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/after-the-closure-of-backpage-increasingly-vulnerable-sex-workers-are-demanding-their-rights"">sex workers at risk</a>. Free speech fundamentalism harms marginalized people in some cases. But free speech rights are vital for their protection in others.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, weighing harms and benefits can be difficult. Free speech fundamentalism offers to make things simpler; you just pick one principle and stick by it, ignoring all other concerns. But the 14th Amendment, not to mention common sense and decency, argue that approach is inadequate. Contra Lincoln, the Constitution doesn't magically safeguard our liberties, though it provides some principles that can be helpful in preserving them. We can use the Constitution to create a better country. But constitutional fundamentalism will create a worse one.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and cultural critic based in Chicago.

But while June has become a month-long celebration for many, it’s apparent that we currently have two different prides occurring.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While rainbows are replacing corporation logos across the nation, Black folks like myself are attending rallies for the death of our trans sisters — most recently <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/activists-demand-justice-for-layleen-polanco-a-black-t-1835379347"">Layleen Polanco Xtranveganza</a>, who was found dead in her jail cell in Rikers Island, and <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trans-women-killed-fairmount-heights"">Zoe Spears</a>, who was shot to death on June 15. Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates. AfricanAmericans<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-african-american-community-progress-our-work-far-over"" target=""_blank""> make up more than 40 percent</a> of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite African Americans comprising only 12 percent of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, when HIV stopped being known as a primarily white gay epidemic, it began to feel more and more like an afterthought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist"">“safe spaces.”</a> In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/20/15821858/gay-pride-flag-philadelphia-fight-explained"">black and brown stripe</a> to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia's gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through <a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"">mandatory anti-discrimination</a> training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other<a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"" target=""_blank""> alleged incidents</a> involving racial discrimination.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I experienced many of these <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"">same policies</a> in the Washington D.C. area when I used to live there. Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color. We watch violence occurring at alarming rates in the Black queer community while <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/07/rainbow-capitalism-is-harmful.html"">rainbow capitalism</a> continues to dominate an “inclusion” conversation that never seems to <em>include</em> us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Black queer people are still fighting for survival, white queer people were fighting for marriage equality. This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall.

He was part of a litigation team that helped file a class-action lawsuit during the Obama administration against the Tucson, Arizona, Customs and Border Protection sector over conditions in its border holding facility. The lawsuit that detailed poor conditions still is in the courts.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Reichlin-Melnick said conditions at the border have been bad for a long time, but today, because of the overcrowding, they've become worse than they were before. The Border Patrol holding facilities are notoriously known as ""hieleras,"" Spanish for ice box or freezer. But Reichlin-Melnick pointed out that in a recent report, a government investigator said a Border Patrol facility was so overcrowded that the temperature in a cell was 80 degrees.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that if he were grading the conditions under the two administrations on a scale of 1 to 10, he would put them at 8 to 9 under Obama.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said migrant women told her they were instructed to drink from the toilet. Rep. Joaquín Castro, D-Texas, reported that water was not running in one of the cells seen by members of Congress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Castro and Ocasio-Cortez got pushback on social media with arguments that the conditions existed under Obama as well. But Castro and others found no running water in some cells.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ojeda said the conditions that existed and have worsened flourish because there is and has been little third-party oversight over CBP, a part of the DHS, in this administration and the others before it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said “there’s no question things have gotten worse” as Trump has pushed deterrence as part of his immigration and asylum policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CBP could better manage the population, deciding to release migrants rather than holding them for lengthy periods, Ojeda said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“CBP has the same authority as (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to release people from custody, but it chooses not to do so because they believe they need consequences,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ojeda said she overhead one woman in a video posted by Castro say she has been held for 50 days in the facility.

""So he is going home.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The jury of five Marines and two sailors — one of whom is a SEAL — had to decide if the boy was stabbed to death, or died from wounds sustained during an airstrike with Gallagher's being falsely accused by disgruntled subordinates. The jury began deliberations Monday in the court-martial at Naval Base San Diego.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Seven SEALs have testified during the trial over the past two weeks hat Gallagher abruptly stabbed the teen prisoner on May 3, 2017, just after he and other medics treated the boy.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Two of them said they witnessed Gallagher, a 19-year-veteran, stab the teen. But one of them, Special Operator Corey Scott, who is also a medic, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/courtroom-shocker-witness-testifies-he-killed-islamic-state-prisoner-not-n1020006"" target=""_blank"">said he was the person who killed the boy when he plugged his breathing tube with his thumb in an act of mercy</a>. The admission stunned the courtroom.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Most of the SEALs, including Scott, were granted immunity to protect them from being prosecuted for what they said on the stand.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">An Iraqi general testified that Gallagher did not stab the boy, and Marine Staff Sgt. Giorgio Kirylo said that he didn't see any stab wounds on the young ISIS fighter when he moved the corpse to take a ""cool guy trophy"" photo with it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">On Monday in closing arguments for the prosecution, Navy Cmdr. Jeff Pietrzyk told the jury that while the detained Islamic fighter was not a sympathetic figure, he was under the control of the U.S. military, which meant he was no longer a lawful target.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Pietrzyk also said that text messages sent by Gallagher prove his guilt. One message said: ""I've got a cool story for you when I get back. I've got my knife skills on."" Another text stated: ""Good story behind this. Got him with my hunting knife.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Pietrzyk then showed a photo of Gallagher holding up the dead prisoner's head by the hair. ""The government's evidence in this case is Chief Gallagher's words, Chief Gallagher's pictures, Chief Gallagher's SEALs,"" Pietrzyk said, according to The Associated Press.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gallagher's lawyers said the text was just an example of dark combat humor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Parlatore said Monday that Scott's surprise testimony about blocking the airway tube happened because prosecutors never asked the right questions because they were so fixated on prosecuting Gallagher.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that there was no body, no forensics, no science and no case against Gallagher. He said much of what was communicated in texts was just bravado.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This is case is not about murder, it's about mutiny,"" Parlatore said, telling jurors that the SEALs who testified against Gallagher lied because they didn't like his demanding leadership.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SEAL sniper Dalton Tolbert testified that he does not remember who started a group chat called ""The Sewing Circle,"" but the purpose of it was to connect with others who were disturbed by what they saw while deployed with Gallagher, and decide how to handle it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I shot more warning shots to save civilians from Eddie than I ever did at ISIS.

It’s a practice that, under different circumstances, Trump himself would likely blast as “fake news.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump campaign officials declined repeated requests for comment on Tuesday. Political experts say that, while it’s not unusual for stock footage to find its way into ads, a presidential campaign should have been more careful.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As a producer, you want to control — you want people to look a certain way and you want them to sound a certain way,” said Jay Newell, a former cable TV executive who teaches advertising at Iowa State University. “The fact that the footage is from outside the U.S. makes it that much more embarrassing.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There are plenty examples of such gaffes. In the last presidential primaries, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio ran an ad titled “Morning in America” with shots from Canada. A super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush put ads on TV with video reportedly from the English countryside and workers from Southeast Asia.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump himself has used video from abroad before. His 2016 TV ad vowing to build a wall to keep out immigrants from Mexico showed people streaming across the border — but the shots of refugees were taken in Morocco.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The existence of the stock footage in this series of Trump ads, reported last week by Judd Legum for his website <a href=""https://popular.info/"">Popular Information</a> , underscores an increasingly aggressive, targeted approach by the Trump campaign to reach out to voters on Facebook.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which was behind the testimonial videos, is by far the biggest spender on political Facebook advertising, shelling out more than $2.7 million on 27,735 ads in the last 90 days alone, according to the social network’s running <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/report/"">database</a> of campaign ad spending. That’s in addition to the more than $1 million spent on more than 14,500 ads in the same period by Donald J. Trump for President Inc.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump’s campaign gets to such totals by running the same ads numerous times, all at slightly different audiences.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US&amp;page_ids%5b0%5d=153080620724&amp;q=poll"">“Thomas from Washington,”</a> featuring the bearded young man behind a coffee shop counter, appeared aimed at evangelicals, with the voice-over quote saying the president and his family are “in our prayers for strength and wisdom from God almighty.” ″TJ from Texas” seemed focused on Hispanic men. And “Tracey in Florida” was aimed specifically at a demographic in which Trump is historically weak — young women.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All are models for Turkish, Brazilian and French companies, respectively, that supply hundreds of photos and video to the popular site iStock run by Getty Images, which caters to publications, filmmakers and advertisers looking for professional, inexpensive imagery.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to the site, licenses for the video clips used in the Trump ads can be had for as little as $170.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The <a href=""https://www.istockphoto.com/video/young-woman-smiling-and-walking-at-the-beach-gm498563362-80138239"">blonde on the beach</a> appears to be particularly prolific. Her photos and videos from the French company Tuto Photos in Roubaix, France, show her twirling in a wedding gown, walking spaniels in a meadow, getting her teeth checked at the dentist and working in a warehouse.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the star of iStock’s <a href=""https://www.istockphoto.com/video/bearded-and-tattooed-hipster-coffee-shop-owner-posing-gm646907988-117863677"">“Bearded and tattooed hipster coffee shop owner posing”</a> — also known as Trump’s “Thomas from Washington” — is a fixture on the videos and photos contributed by the company GM Stock out of Izmir, Turkey. His unmistakable beard and tats can be seen on the image site strolling with a woman on the beach, sitting by a campfire and pumping iron in the gym.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So what do these models think of being held up as model Trump supporters?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That’s not clear because none of the companies they’ve posed for would give a detailed comment to The Associated Press. A spokeswoman for Getty Images would not identify the models, citing privacy concerns.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Fred Davis, a campaign consultant who’s produced ads for George W.

353,North Dakota is trying to turn abortion doctors into 'government mouthpieces',21,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-medical-association-sues-after-north-dakota-passes-abortion-reversal-n1025861,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,18,31,us-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The American Medical Association has sued the state of North Dakota to block a new law that they say forces doctors to “act as the government’s mouthpiece” and lie to women seeking abortions.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The Compelled Reversal Mandate forces physicians to tell their patients that medication abortions may be reversible, a claim wholly unsupported by the best, most reliable scientific evidence, contravening their ethical and legal obligations as medical providers,” the AMA stated in the 23-page complaint filed last week in U.S. District Court in Bismarck.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">House Bill 1336, which was passed by the state’s Republican-dominated legislature, also violates physicians’ First Amendment rights by requiring them to tell patients that abortion terminates “the life of a whole, separate, unique, living human being.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The Compelled Personhood Mandate forces Physicians to act as the government’s mouthpiece to speak a message that is unrelated to the medical details, risks and benefits of the procedure,” the complaint states.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The AMA said that when this law goes into effect on Aug. 1. doctors will be forced — under the threat of criminal penalty — to deliver a “controversial and ideological message about fetal personhood that is unmoored from medical science.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The patient-physician relationship is the cornerstone of health care, and depends upon honest, open conversations about all of a patient’s health care options,"" AMA President Patrice Harris said in a statement to NBC News. ""North Dakota’s law undermines this relationship by requiring physicians to mislead and misinform their patients with messages that contradict reality and science. The AMA will always defend science and open conversations about all health care options available to patients.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, which is the only abortion clinic in North Dakota, echoed Harris.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“North Dakota’s laws are forcing us to say things that violate our medical ethics and are simply false and not backed up by science,” said Kromenaker.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The North Dakota Attorney General’s office is reviewing the complaint, public information office Liz Brocker said in an email to NBC News.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The prime mover behind the new law, Kromenaker said, was Rep. Daniel Johnston, a Republican from Kathryn, North Dakota. He is a married father of eight and Army vet, according to <a href=""https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/65-2017/members/house/representative-daniel-johnston"" target=""_blank"">his official biography</a>. He is not a doctor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Johnston did not return an email and call from NBC News seeking comment.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Women seeking abortions in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy generally have two options: a surgical procedure or a medication-based abortion. It’s the latter procedure that HB 1336 targets.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">To terminate a pregnancy using medication, women take <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/medical-abortion/about/pac-20394687"" target=""_blank"">mifepristone and then misoprosto</a>l 24 hours apart.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Mifepristone blocks progesterone, which is a hormone that helps sustain a pregnancy. Misoprostol makes the uterus contract and expel the embryo through the vagina.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Under the new North Dakota law, the suit states, doctors would be required to tell women 24 hours before an abortion that “it may be possible to reverse the effects of an abortion-inducing drug if she changes her mind.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is no credible evidence that medication abortion administered via the combined mifepristone/misoprostol regime can be reversed,” the suit states.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It notes that several witnesses testified before lawmakers about an “experimental practice proposed by a physician in San Diego, who believes he can ‘reverse’ the effects of mifepristone prior to the administration of misoprostol.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That, Kromenaker said, was a reference to <a href=""https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/george-delgado/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. George Delgado</a>. He has claimed in published studies that women who had taken mifepristone — and then changed their minds about having abortions — were able to carry their pregnancies to term after receiving progesterone injections.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Delgado is a founding member of <a href=""https://www.heartbeatinternational.org/our-work/apr"" target=""_blank"">Abortion Pill Rescue, </a>which has <a href=""https://www.abortionpillreversal.com/about/our-team"" target=""_blank"">championed </a>his claims.

""Unfounded legislative mandates represent dangerous political interference and compromise patient care and safety.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Other critics have accused Delgado of inflating his success rate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""A systematic review we coauthored in 2015 found no evidence that pregnancy continuation was more likely after treatment with progesterone as compare with expectant management among women who have taken mifepristone,"" Dr. Daniel Grossman, a gynecologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and University of Alabama sociologist Kari White wrote in the <a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1805927"" target=""_blank"">New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meanwhile, gynecologist Mitchell Creinin has launched a study funded by the Society of Family Planning to see whether so-called abortion pill reversal actually works, <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/03/22/688783130/controversial-abortion-reversal-regimen-is-put-to-the-test"" target=""_blank"">National Public Radio </a>reported in March.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">NBC News reached out to Delgado via the Abortion Pill Rescue.

355,FBI investigates 'glitter bombing' of Straight Pride Parade organizers,23,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/fbi-investigates-glitter-bombing-straight-pride-parade-organizers-n1025851,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,18,31,nbc-out,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The FBI has confirmed that an investigation has been launched after three members of Super Happy Fun America, the organization behind Boston’s upcoming Straight Pride Parade, were sent glitter-filled envelopes in the mail this week.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The envelope immediately struck me as different. There was no return address, and it was taped around the edges, as if they didn’t want anything to fall out,” Samson Racioppi, one of the organizers, told NBC News. “I pinched the bottom and felt this granular substance.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The granular substance he felt was glitter, according to Lt. Robert Roy of the Salisbury Police Department. Roy also said the envelopes included Bible verses with “Happy Pride” signed in rainbow colors. <a href=""https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/State-Police-Bomb-Squad-Responding-to-3-Separate-Locations-512071511.html"">One of the verses,</a> Psalms 86:15, states, ""But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Glitter bombing” — covering someone in colorful glitter — has historically been used as an act of protest against those who oppose LGBTQ rights. Former House Speaker <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84ppVL8IYec"">Newt Gingrich </a>was famously glitter bombed in 2011 by a protestor who yelled: “Feel the rainbow, Newt! Stop the hate! Stop anti-gay politics.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, the organizers of the Straight Pride Parade, which is scheduled for Aug. 31, maintain that they are “not anti-gay,” just simply “pro-straight.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After receiving the “suspicious” envelope, Racioppi said he immediately alerted other members of Super Happy Fun America. That’s when he discovered that John Hugo and Mark Sahady, the president and vice president of the organization, respectively, had each received similar mailings. Hugo, a Republican who unsuccessfully ran for Massachusetts' 5th Congressional District in 2018, urged Racioppi to call police.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“With all of the controversy surrounding my activism, I’ve had to make numerous police reports,” Racioppi said. “They know me at this point.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After Racioppi alerted the authorities, bomb squads were sent to the Massachusetts towns of Woburn, Salisbury and Malden. Hugo, who called the mailings an “act of domestic terrorism,” said he had also alerted conservative firebrand Milo Yiannopoulos, the grand marshal of the upcoming Straight Pride Parade, though it does not appear Yiannopoulos was sent a glitter-filled mailing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the investigation is ongoing, FBI spokeswoman Kristen Setera told NBC News, “There is no threat to public safety.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Hugo, however, maintains he still doesn’t know what the contents of the envelope are. “Even if it’s just baby powder,” he added, “I want to see this person prosecuted.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Straight Pride Parade was first announced in early June, at the beginning of LGBTQ Pride month, to great controversy. Actor Brad Pitt threatened legal action after Super Happy Fun America used his picture and advertised him as the parade’s mascot without his permission.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Many have deemed the event homophobic, viewing it as a step backward in Massachusetts, which in 2004 became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has criticized the event, though he stated that the city cannot deny permits based on personal beliefs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Whatever outside groups may try to do, he said, ""our values won't change.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I invite each and every person to stand with us, and show that love will always prevail,” Walsh wrote on Twitter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some of the parade organizers have been linked to <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/straight-pride-parade-boston-far-right-mark-sahady-john-hugo-chris-bartley-a8950836.html"">far-right and white nationalist groups</a>. Sahady has a history of organizing and participating in events hosted by Resist Marxism, a conservative activist group dedicated to ""American nationalism"" and defending ""the Constitution from violent extremists and the regressive left,” along with the New Hampshire American Guard and the Massachusetts Patriot Front, organizations that have been labeled white supremacist groups by the <a href=""https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounders/patriot-front"" target=""_blank"">Anti-Defamation League.</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet the Straight Pride organizers claim they are “inclusive of all, including LGBTQ people,” asserting that they have a “<a href=""http://www.superhappyfunamerica.com/our-team/"">gay ambassador </a>who challenges heterophobia” on their team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We want to take back the public square.

That led to nerve cells sometimes ending up in the wrong place and layers that were disorganized.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While this mutation isn’t found in all people with autism, studying its effects “tells you where in development things might have gone wrong and could have led to brain malformations that could trigger autism,” Anton said. “Patients with mutations in Memo1 tend to have autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disabilities and some have epilepsy.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The new study shows how the mutation of a gene that has been linked to autism can lead to localized defects in the brain, said Dr. Nenad Sestan, a brain development specialist and a professor of neuroscience at the Yale University School of Medicine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“These radial glia are the stem cells of the brain,” Sestan, who was not involved in the new study, said. “They create all the neurons in the cortex and guide them to their final destination.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Genetic studies have focused on hundreds of genes that could be involved in the development of autism, said Alex Kolodkin, an expert in neural development and the Charles J. Homcy and Simeon G. Margolis professor of neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. “And a significant fraction end up as being involved,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The issue, he said, is now figuring out how to link the genes known to be associated with autism to the defects in brain wiring.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The research also “suggests that some of the disruptions that may contribute to autism could be happening earlier than we thought — in the first three months of fetal development,” Sestan said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Linda Carroll is a regular health contributor to NBC News and Reuters Health.

Chris Stewart said at a news conference Monday that the youths, who range in age from 15 to 20, were at The Shoppes at Bel Air late last month to buy clothes for the Fourth of July holiday when they were approached by a mall security K-9 officer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Stewart said the officer, who is employed by the security company Allied Universal, got out of his car with his hand on his gun and immediately went ""into attack mode.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The officer shoved ""the boys against the wall"" and handcuffed them as officers with the Mobile Police Department arrived to provide backup, Stewart said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Allied Universal said in a statement that its security officer and an officer with the Mobile Police Department were responding to a report of ""a fight in progress at the mall's entrance.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We assisted the Mobile police officer in helping to detain an individual who was uncooperative and physically resisted police orders,"" a spokesperson for the company said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Stewart said the group was playing around and chasing each other ""like every other teenager"" does.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">According to Stewart, when Cameron Robinson, 16, accused officers of racial profiling, the mall security officer grabbed him by the neck and slammed him on his head.

363,Who got the biggest tax refunds this year? Higher earners.,31,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/who-got-biggest-tax-refunds-year-higher-earners-n1025646,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,18,31,business,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, lawmakers promised that Americans would get a tax break. Most of them did, with some big caveats: The benefits of the legislation weren’t conferred equally, and some upper-middle-class filers expecting refunds got a rude awakening instead.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">New data from the Internal Revenue Service shows that families earning between $100,000 and $250,000 were less likely to receive a refund this year by five percentage points; those who did get a refund, on average, got smaller refunds than they had the previous year. (Filers in income brackets below $100,000 received refunds at about the same rate.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For slightly wealthier Americans, it was another story: The number of filers with household income between $250,000 and $500,000 who got refunds rose by five percentage points, and those refunds were bigger, too.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tax experts say this highlights some of the quirks — and shortcomings — of the new tax code and the manner in which it was rolled out.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s not surprising because you had a tax bill that was passed in haste, signed at the end of December and effective January 1. Most people didn’t know what the heck was going on,” said Mark Mazur, director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “The refund results reflect some of that confusion,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Changes to the IRS withholding tables that kicked in early in 2018 went largely unnoticed by many taxpayers. Since much of the tax cut was spread out across workers’ paychecks over the course of 2018, many people never noticed it. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll conducted around tax time found that only 17 percent of Americans thought they had gotten a tax break. In reality, it’s closer to 80 percent.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The standard deduction for married couples filing jointly roughly doubled to $24,000 for 2018, but the TCJA also eliminated personal exemptions and pared back or eliminated many itemized deductions.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“In the past, a lot of those folks were able to benefit by being able to deduct all their state income taxes on top of all their real estate taxes,” said Craig Richards, director of tax services at wealth management firm Fiduciary Trust Company International. “Those are the folks who probably aren’t benefiting any longer.” The IRS data shows that the number of returns with itemized deductions plummeted from nearly 40 million last year to fewer than 14 million this year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The data could be skewed because some wealthier Americans haven’t filed their taxes yet. “Higher-income people did seem to have greater volatility to their tax burden and their refunds,” said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lawmakers’ push to get the TCJA passed in 2017 meant that the IRS faced tight deadlines for hammering out the details of how the new tax rules would be applied, and some aspects — particularly those relating to partnerships and certain types of business income and expenses — weren’t finalized in time for tax day.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Steber noted that the number of extensions filed this year had risen. “We’ve been trying to figure out why there are so many more extenders,” he said. When those returns trickle in, it could very well change the statistical averages.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""> One likely factor: Confusion around how the new tax code would be applied. “Quite a few of those people still have some uncertainty in the tax law or are waiting for some of these unknowns to be settled,” he said. “The higher-income taxpayers or the more complex taxpayer may have decided to wait,” rather than file an amended return.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The kind of income earned also makes a difference. Households in the $100,000 to $250,000 income bracket probably earn most, if not all, of their money via wages and salaries, but income streams get more varied as the amount increases, and that changes how it’s viewed by the IRS.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“You go further up the income distribution, people have more and more business income, and they tend to file quarterly tax payments,” Mazur said. “The pass-through deduction benefited people with business income, who were generally higher-income people,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Regardless of income bracket, tax experts urge Americans not to focus too much on their refund, which isn’t necessarily indicative of their overall tax burden.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The tax refund is a vastly different element than tax burden — a lot of people mingle the two,” Steber said. “Don’t be fooled by the metric of the tax refund. It provides some indication, but it’s not the underlying data you need to know to manage your taxes.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Martha C.

I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

Trump heralded the meeting as “wonderful” and an “honor.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But this made-for-TV event will only be remembered as historic if it leads to an agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to fully and permanently give up his rogue nuclear weapons arsenal and ballistic missiles. Otherwise, the meeting is nothing more than a photo opportunity and media spectacle.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And one has to ask, what is really different this time that should make us confident that Trump will succeed when all of his predecessors — going back to President George H.W. Bush — could not? Ultimately, the likelihood that a deal will happen rests solely on an intangible that Trump has brought to the decades-old problem.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">One has to ask, what is really different this time that should make us more confident that will allow Trump to succeed when all of his predecessors — going back to President George H.W. Bush — could not?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite saying otherwise, Trump does not deserve credit for de-escalating war with North Korea. This gross re-writing of history conflicts entirely with the events of 2017, when Trump nearly stumbled into a nuclear war with Kim. He also does not gain kudos for boasting about the spontaneity of his meeting with Kim at the DMZ on Sunday. A week before Trump’s trip to Korea, U.S. officials scheduled to appear at our event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a number of other venues around Washington suddenly became no-shows because they said it was a ""sensitive"" time in North Korea, leading many of us to think something was afoot in the Trump-Kim bromance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump does deserve credit for using the DMZ rendezvous to reset relations after the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-summit.html"">failed summit in Vietnam</a> four months ago, and for showing persistence in his diplomatic outreach despite recent <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2019-05-16/why-north-korea-testing-missiles-again"">North Korean ballistic missile tests</a>. And he finally will allow the working-level experts, who shared the stage at the news conference, to hammer out the details of a deal that might allow for Kim’s visit to the White House, an invitation Trump has already extended.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the DMZ on Sunday, Trump suggested a willingness to loosen sanctions per Kim’s request at the failed Hanoi summit in February. But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25384533/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/bush-us-lift-key-north-korea-sanctions/"" target=""_blank"">George W. Bush lifted some sanctions over a decade ago</a> and that did not lead to denuclearization. After the first summit in Singapore in 2018, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/asia/south-korea-trump-military-drills.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump suspended military exercises</a> between the U.S. and South Korea as a confidence-building measure for Kim, but President Bill Clinton did the same for two years — from 1994 to 1996 — without a denuclearization outcome. Achieving a mutually agreed upon definition of “denuclearization” between Washington and Pyongyang would certainly move the talks forward, but Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43 all achieved this with the North Koreans without a successful result.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, the one unique element of the negotiation this time is Trump’s personal campaign to befriend and gain the trust of the young leader. Whether it’s the oversize “love letters,” or Trump giving props to Kim for showing up at the DMZ, it’s extraordinary how the leader of the free world has embraced (literally) the world’s worst dictator. Is this enough to really change the tide of history on the Korean Peninsula?</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Like a CEO trying to close a deal, Trump reached across the table to shake Kim’s hands and looked directly and deeply into his eyes. But Kim did not reciprocate in kind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The answer became clearer as the two men sat next to each other, taking questions from the press. Trump talked about how the leaders’ relationship can achieve great things. Like a CEO trying to close a deal, Trump reached across the table to shake Kim’s hands and looked directly and deeply into his eyes. But Kim did not reciprocate in kind, glancing at Trump, but then averting his gaze, looking away, smiling and nodding to the cameras.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Can an insecure dictator like Kim trust anyone? Indeed, does he even understand the concept of trust when he executes his uncles and murders his siblings? Even then it may be possible, but not likely, with a pathological twister of the truth like Donald Trump. As his career in real estate has shown, Trump is about the most untrustworthy partner one can imagine. Moreover, the start of the presidential campaign in the U.S. reduces the level of interest on both sides to make a deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Trump, an agreement (which will almost certainly be imperfect) will be a target for all of his critics. For Kim, locking in a deal with a potentially outgoing president offers little promise. Given all of these factors, despite the heightened expectations, a bromance between the dictator and the president may make only for good theater.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Victor Cha was deputy head of US delegation for the 2007 denuclearization agreement with North Korea.

392,Taylor Swift catalog battle reveals dark truth about music industry,60,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-catalogue-battle-about-more-just-music-ncna1025541,2019-07-02,2019,7,2,18,31,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Like many pop stars, Taylor Swift performs empowerment. Her songs — from her triumphant 2012 breakup anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64"">We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</a>"" to 2014's brushoff to the haters ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM"">Shake It Off</a>"" to 2017's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA"">Look What You Made Me Do</a>"" — often portray her overcoming obstacles and self-actualizing. She's in control of her own image, her own narrative, her own sexuality and her own art. That's part of why pop stars are so inspiring and so appealing to so many — they seem to be free.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This week, though, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/justin-bieber-criticizes-taylor-swift-crossing-line-scooter-braun-post-n1025151"" target=""_blank"">Swift has been talking less</a> about freedom and more about exploitation. She wrote an <a href=""https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/185958366550/for-years-i-asked-pleaded-for-a-chance-to-own-my"" target=""_blank"">impassioned post on Tumblr</a>, denouncing the music executives Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun after Borchetta's Big Machine Records label — which<a href=""https://www.spin.com/2019/07/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-beef-explained/"" target=""_blank""> released all Swift's album's through 2017's ""Reputation"" </a>— decided to sell Big Machine, including Swift's back catalog, to Braun.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">That's part of why pop stars are so inspiring and so appealing to so many — they seem to be free.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift's accusations, and the counter claims, are <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swifts-masters-scooter-brauns-bullying-inside-the-big-machine-ithaca-holdings-deal-1203256640/"">numerous and complicated</a>. But basically the pop star is angry because she created her music and her albums, and she believes she should be the one who owns them. Instead, a man — who Swift thinks doesn’t have her best interests at heart — owns her work.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The idea that Swift should own the product of her work is an argument that makes powerful intuitive sense. And yet, it's contrary to the working experience of virtually everyone under capitalism. Swift's disagreement with Borchetta highlights the way in which work can be an alienating experience. It also helps to explain why in most cases, for most people, that alienation isn't seen as unjust, even when it should be.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In her Tumblr post, <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/taylor-swift-slams-scooter-brauns-acquisition-of-big-machine-as-my-worst-case-scenario-1203256624/"" target=""_blank"">Swift says</a> that Borchetta is selling the ""music I wrote on my bedroom floor and video I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then arenas, then stadiums."" Pop star Halsey <a href=""https://twitter.com/halsey/status/1145435250295635968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1145435250295635968&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Fbiz%2Fnews%2Ftaylor-swift-slams-scooter-brauns-acquisition-of-big-machine-as-my-worst-case-scenario-1203256624%2F"">put the case</a> even more succinctly in a tweet where she said that Swift ""deserves to own the painstaking labor of her heart.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift and Halsey are both describing, in pop terms, the Marxist idea of alienated labor. Karl Marx believed that under capitalism, workers lose control of their labor, which is wrested from them and turned into products and objects that benefit others. ""The object which labor produces — labor’s product — confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer,"" <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm"" target=""_blank"">Marx explains</a>. Swift created albums — ""Fearless,"" ""Red,"" ""1989,"" etc. — and those albums are her labor. That labor is packaged and commodified so others can enjoy it — but also exploit it. Braun can even sell it without her consent. Her labor should be hers, but under capitalism it becomes someone else's. That's alienation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift's plight is so visible, and so visceral, because we think of work in the arts as uniquely fulfilling, according to <a href=""https://www.fims.uwo.ca/people/profiles/matt_stahl.html"">Matt Stahl</a>, author of ""Unfree Masters: Popular Music and the Politics of Work."" Poets, painters, movie directors and pop stars are idolized in part because they perform unalienated labor. They express their genius, and their ideas authentically, for their own satisfaction and their own profit.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Those albums are her labor. That labor is packaged and commodified so others can enjoy it — but also exploit it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Pop stars like Taylor Swift are narrating their story on behalf of all the people who learn from it and grow with it and identify with it,"" Stahl explains. And that means those stars ""have, if not within their grasp then within their imaginings, the possibility of overturning the relationship of exploitation.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The catch here is that most people not only don't own their labor but aren't in a cultural position to even imagine owning it. Swift can say, ""I should own my albums,"" and it makes instant sense. But if an assembly line worker said, ""I should own my cars,"" or a Walmart employee said, ""I should own my store"" they'd receive substantially less public support, presuming they could even find anyone to listen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In fact, Stahl points out, pop stars themselves exploit the labor of others. Swift talks as if the albums she created are hers and hers alone. But what about the other musicians who played on them? Guitarists, drummers, keyboardists, video directors and mixing engineers all made artistic contributions to Swift's albums and videos. They honed their skills in their own bedrooms on their own time and invested their own money in their own careers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And then their labor goes into the product that is Taylor Swift albums, and their names and contributions are forgotten. Swift ""is an employee who's being exploited for the term of her contract,"" Stahl says. ""And similarly she's an employer who gets to alienate the label of all those people who do the technical, creative and interpretive services that help her do a record or a tour or a video.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The point here isn't that Swift is a hypocrite, or that she shouldn't have control over the product of her labor. Rather, the point is that <em>everyone</em> should have control over the product of their labor. We may notice the injustice in the case of Swift, because we see pop stars and artists as uniquely free. When that freedom is impinged upon, it seems wrong. And it is wrong. But if we want it to be right, we need to free a lot more people than just Taylor Swift.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and cultural critic based in Chicago.

""Be proud of the Flag that you wear.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was reacting to a new viral video in which Rapinoe, asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT/status/1143918087735054336"">months ago</a> whether she would visit the White House if invited by the president, responded casually: “Pfft. I’m not going to the f------ White House.” Rapinoe isn’t alone either — teammates Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger and Becky Sauerbrunn have all shared similar sentiments publicly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Apparently to Trump, this means that Rapinoe and her highly decorated teammates don’t respect their country and aren’t patriotic enough. Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After all, for years Rapinoe and her colleagues have been doing the most patriotic things athletes can do: Not only have they’ve been winning World Cups and Olympic gold medals for the United States, they’ve managed it all while fighting for equality — in sports and society at large.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When Rapinoe first joined the national team in 2006, the U.S. women were <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">already fighting for the rights of female athletes</a>. They were demanding a living wage so they don’t need second jobs, a calendar of regular games to stay sharp and protections so if players get injured (or pregnant) their careers wouldn’t be stuck in limbo — benefits their male counterparts already enjoyed. Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts. Rapinoe and the women of the women’s national team couldn’t be better examples of patriots, whether or not they beat France in Friday’s quarterfinal and continue their campaign to defend their World Cup title.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Caitlin Murray is the author of “<a href=""https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/national-team_9781419734496/"">The National Team: The Inside Story Of The Women Who Changed Soccer</a>,” a narrative history of the U.S. women's national soccer team.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

However, the Brussels-born mother-of-seven's nomination was a surprise after E.U. leaders failed during long and fraught negotiations to agree on any of the front-runners.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both she and Lagarde, 63, still need approval from European lawmakers before they can enter these top jobs. The votes are expected to take place mid-July.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Von der Leyen has criticized Trump, namely his stance on Russia following the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Donald Trump has to say clearly on which side he is: whether he's on the side of the law, peace and democracy or whether he doesn’t care about all that and instead he's looking for a best buddy,"" she said. The ""best buddy"" to whom she referred was Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She has also suggested that Trump's strained relationship with Merkel was due to his lack of familiarity with strong female leaders.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""A woman like Angela Merkel, a globally respected head of government with a long experience, probably did not exist in his worldview until now,"" she told<a href=""https://www.spiegel.de/plus/ursula-von-der-leyen-ueber-donald-trump-und-den-rechtspopulismus-a-00000000-0002-0001-0000-000158616263"" target=""_blank""> Spiegel magazine last year.</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nevertheless, her pick was a surprise, not just because she came ahead of more recognizable names on the continent, but also because she has struggled as a member of her own government. She was dismissed Tuesday by former European Parliament President Martin Schulz as<a href=""https://twitter.com/MartinSchulz/status/1146075889916096513"" target=""_blank""> Germany's ""weakest minister.""</a></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Her tenure at the ministry of defense has been marked by scandals over the awarding of contracts, right-wing extremism in the German armed forces and criticism about gaps in military readiness. That said, she is far from the first Germany defense minister weighed down by scandal, and she has held on to the job for longer than recent predecessors.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Von der Leyen is also a Europhile who has advocated a federalist approach of closer integration within the bloc. In 2011, <a href=""https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2011-08/leyen-politische-union-europa"" target=""_blank"">she even said she wanted</a> a ""United States of Europe along the lines of federal states like Switzerland, Germany or the U.S.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, the German ambassador to Britain, Peter Wittig, told the BBC Wednesday that she was a ""pragmatist"" rather than a federalist. Such a distinction could prove important, as installing an overtly federalist chief could alienate euroskeptics, such as Britain's Brexit Party, who will need to ratify her position.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In London, lawmakers will also be picking apart her views on Brexit, which she described last year as ""a burst bubble of hollow promises."" She has also said that a no-deal Brexit would be the <a href=""https://www.ursula-von-der-leyen.de/files/2019_04_12_Brief_aus_Berlin-Post_fuer_Hannover.pdf"" target=""_blank"">“worst possible start”</a> to the post-Brexit relationship between Britain and the E.U.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Lagarde has led the International Monetary Fund since 2011 and last year was ranked the <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/profile/christine-lagarde/#195005cd2170"" target=""_blank"">third most powerful woman in the world by Forbes</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lawyer rather than economist by training, she was the first woman to lead the Chicago law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie.

""Her speech was slurred, and she stumbled as she walked,"" the ruling said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""While on the sofa, a group of boys sprayed Febreze on Mary's bottom and slapped it with such force that the following day she had hand marks on her buttocks,"" the ruling said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">G.M.C. then penetrated Mary from behind in a home-gym portion of the basement. In the video he sent to seven friends, her torso is exposed, and her head is hanging down. One of the friends said that the video showed Mary's head hitting against the wall repeatedly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Prosecutors said that during the assault, the door to the gym was blocked by a foosball table, and the lights were off.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""[G.M.C.'s] conduct as it relates to the charged offenses was both sophisticated and predatory. He was aware of the off-limits areas in advance of the party,"" prosecutors said, adding that ""filming a cell phone video while committing the assault was a deliberate act of debasement.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Following the alleged assault, other kids at the party checked on Mary and found her on the floor vomiting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was driven home by a friend's mother, and told her mother the next morning that she feared ""sexual things had happened at the party,"" the appeals court ruling said. ""She did not understand how she could have gotten bruise marks on her body or how her clothing had torn.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She then learned that G.M.C. was sending the video of the assault to his friends, and asked him to stop. When he didn't, her family pressed charges.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Prosecutors in New Jersey can seek to send a juvenile case to adult court for serious crimes, including sexual assault, if the accused is 15 or older.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If Judge James Troiano had decided to charge G.M.C. as an adult, as the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office requested, he would have faced counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault, third-degree endangering the welfare of a child and two counts of third-degree invasion of privacy. He would have had to register as a sex offender.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in a July 30, 2018, decision, Troiano denied the prosecutors' request.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ""young man comes from a good family who put him into an excellent school where he was doing extremely well. He is clearly a candidate for not just college but probably for a good college. His scores for college entry were very high,"" the judge said, in which he also noted G.M.C. was an Eagle scout.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Troiano also ""expressed concern that the prosecutor did not indicate ... that she had explained to Mary and her mother the devastating effect"" adult charges would have on G.M.C.'s life, the appeals court ruling said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The judge said he questioned Mary's claimed state of intoxication at the time of the assault.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Some people would argue that, you know ... how could she possibly have gotten as drunk as she says she was?"" the judge asked. ""That's really not important. I think it's an issue here, whether or not this young lady was intoxicated to the point that she didn't understand what was going on.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And he wondered whether G.M.C.'s actions could be classified as a rape, saying he distinguishes between sexual assault and rape.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""In my mind,"" Troiano said, a rape is ""where there were generally two or more generally males involved, either at gunpoint or weapon, clearly manhandling a person into ... an area where ... there was nobody around, sometime in an abandon[ed] house, sometimes in an abandon[ed] shed, shack, and just simply taking advantage of the person as well as beating the person, threatening the person.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Troiano added that G.M.C.'s text calling the encounter a rape was ""to me, just a 16-year-old boy saying stupid crap to his friends.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""[D]o I believe that it shows in any way a calculation or cruelty on his part or sophistication or a predatory nature? No, I do not,"" Troiano said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the appeals court said prosecutors at least proved that ""the delinquent act in question, if committed by an adult in this case, would have been aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault,"" which would allow for the case to go to adult court.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Rather than focusing on whether the prosecutor's consideration of the statutory factors supported the application, the judge decided the case for himself,"" the appeal court decision said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""That the juvenile came from a good family and had good test scores we assume would not"" spare ""the juveniles who do not come from good families and do not have good test scores"" from adult court, the ruling said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Peter McAleer, the director of communications for New Jersey Courts, said Troiano had no comment on the case. He said Troiano retired within the past year, but still serves periodically.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">G.M.C.'s attorney, Mitchell J.

413,Why LinkedIn is the only social network that survives breakups,15,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/why-linkedin-only-social-network-survives-breakups-n1026191,2019-07-03,2019,7,3,11,12,tech-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When Elisabeth Boyd went through a breakup in 2014, she decided to block her ex on social media to spare herself the pain of seeing his posts. She blocked him on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It wasn’t until about one year later that she realized there was one social network she had missed. She logged onto her LinkedIn and saw her ex had just started a new job.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I didn’t realize I hadn’t blocked him on there until I got a notification,” Boyd, 33 and an executive assistant in Los Angeles, told CNBC on Facebook Messenger. “At that point I had already moved on. Of course, it didn’t stop me from snooping a little!”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Boyd’s digital breakup and exception for LinkedIn appears to be a common trend among millennials dating in the age of social media. While many who date say they tend to unfriend, unfollow or outright block their exes on <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB"" title="""">Facebook</a>, Instagram, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR"" title="""">Twitter</a> and <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=SNAP"" title="""">Snapchat</a> after a relationship ends, LinkedIn seems to be one social network that’s breakup-proof.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For many like Boyd, they say simply forget about LinkedIn, which is a professionally focused social network that was acquired by <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=MSFT"" title="""">Microsoft</a> for $27 billion in 2016.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Others say they make a conscious decision to leave their exes on LinkedIn. One major reason is because LinkedIn is more limited in the amount of personal content that one can post. While other social networks provide constant updates or multiple photos and videos of an ex, LinkedIn does not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“With exes it’s hard to watch their life on social media, but LinkedIn is so much less real-time,” said Abby Horner, a 24-year-old communications professional in San Francisco, in a Twitter message. Horner said she, too, was blocked by a long-time ex-boyfriend after a rough breakup on every social network except for LinkedIn. “You really just see very specific milestones.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Keeping an ex connected on LinkedIn can also serve as a way to signal to them that they are no longer part of your personal life, said Kelly Campbell, professor of psychology at California State University, San Bernardino.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“By keeping an ex as a contact on a professional site, you are sending a message that it’s how you now view them, which equates them with other professional/impersonal connections,” said Campbell, whose research focuses on couple relationships and friendships. “You are sending a message about their new status, conveying: ‘You are no longer allowed in my personal space, we will relate to each other using business norms (e.g., impersonal, cold, transactional).’”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although some allow their exes to remain connected on LinkedIn, others say they choose to disconnect, or have been removed by their exes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Maya Nimnicht, a 27-year-old communications professional in New York, said she was connected with an ex for a number of years before he finally severed the link. She had updated her LinkedIn to reflect a promotion, received a notification that he had looked at her profile and then realized they were no longer connected when she went to look at his.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“If you had the type of breakup that compelled you to block them on most forms of social, I don’t think you’re ever going to be their cheerleader and be excited about their professional achievements,” Nimnicht said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another reason breakups may not impact LinkedIn as much as other social networks is that LinkedIn was slower to add a block feature. Although LinkedIn was launched in 2003, before Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat, the company did not add a block feature until 2014, after it received significant criticism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For some like Caden Reed, 27, that feature has proven critical. Reed, who works in city government administration in San Francisco, said he had to use the block feature in 2017 when the ex-boyfriend of a woman he was dating stalked and harassed him on every social network, including LinkedIn.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I blocked him but forgot to do so on LinkedIn,” Reed said in a Twitter message. “Woke up one morning to LinkedIn requests to connect to him and my inbox was filled with crazy messages from him. It was horrible.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For those who choose to remain connected, there can be professional benefits, especially for those who work in the same field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Boyd, for example, said she and her ex work in the music industry, and at one point she reached out to him when she needed a lighting professional for one of her artists’ tours. Her ex was professional and connected her with several people.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As one gets older, you learn to separate the personal aspect of life from business,” she said. “Enough time had passed, and I trusted his opinion and recommendations.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A LinkedIn spokesperson said, “We’re a professionally oriented network focused on helping members be more productive and successful through professionally relevant content and conversations.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Salvador Rodriguez is a CNBC technology reporter covering Facebook and social media.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

He pushed up with his arms, but couldn’t crawl, so he’d stay in exactly the same place where his parents placed him. When Brody turned 1, the family tried a <a href=""https://www.zipzac.com/"" target=""_blank"">ZipZac</a> baby wheelchair, which he took to well, but it still wasn’t a solution since he couldn’t easily reach the ground where his toys were.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was important that Brody be able to crawl and play on the floor, just like other toddlers.

When he’s tired, he can comfortably rest his head on the floor. The large wheels mean he can easily roll through carpet or over a transition in a doorway. The patent is pending.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The device is an excellent idea, said Elizabeth A. Fain, director of occupational therapy at Pfeiffer University in Misenheimer, North Carolina, who was not involved in its design and offered an independent opinion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It promotes increased shoulder strength and stability, plus increased head and trunk control, she noted. It also boosts visual perceptual skills and cognitive skills.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The design of the Frog enables the child to be secure on the device and be more independent for exploring, which is needed for achieving various developmental tasks,” Fain told TODAY.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I hope that they are able to move it forward to the commercial market.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The device has been “life-changing” for Brody, his parents said. He can chase the cat, open drawers, play with his cousins, explore on his own and “be crazy like any toddler should be,” his mom noted.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since he’s started to explore on his own, Brody has become more curious and has started talking more, his dad added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It was so great to see his little mind working on its own. He would go get the toys he wanted to play with and he would come rolling up to us and ask us something… we look over and he’s gone. Where did he go?” he said, laughing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moreland has now produced Frog devices for 20 kids and there’s a growing waiting list of orders. He creates them at home using a computer numerical control (CNC) machine that cuts out the shape from light, rigid plastic based on his design. The Frog works for kids ages 6 months to 3 years. Moreland is working on a larger version for kids up to 6 years old.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Frog costs $300, but the family is <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/help-brody-get-kids-moving"" target=""_blank"">raising money</a> so that they can donate the device for anyone who needs it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“To see your little one do something you never thought was possible is pretty fun,” Moreland said, adding the family has been overwhelmed by the attention. “Brody now rolls around saying, ‘I’m famous’ all the time.’”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">A.

""He was my mentor, my teacher and role model. When he was on he was fabulous. I will miss him.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Iacocca’s was the classic Horatio Alger tale. He was raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and landed a fellowship that helped him go to Princeton. Graduating in 1946, he immediately joined Ford and became a vice president at the age of 30. By 36, he was an executive vice president. He was named Ford president in December 1970, at just 46.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">By then, he had already accomplished a striking legacy that included the creation of the Ford Mustang. Developed at a cost of $75 million, Ford expected it to be a modest success when it debuted in the spring of 1964, selling perhaps 100,000 a year. In its first year, the figure came to 418,000 and today, 55 years later, the Mustang remains the world’s best-selling sports car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But Iacocca had a tendency “to shake the bushes,” and rattle cages, something that didn’t sit well with Ford Chairman and family heir Henry Ford II, recalled Bud Liebler, who worked under the executive for many years, remaining friends with Iacocca until his death.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Better known as “the Deuce,” Ford fired Iacocca in 1978, reportedly telling him, “I just don’t like you.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It didn’t take long to find new work: Iacocca moved across town to Chrysler. But the company was faltering, and as its new president and CEO — and, later, chairman — Iacocca had to come up with a rescue plan, fast. It was a complex package requiring concessions of workers, suppliers, bankers, dealers and both the U.S. and Canadian governments. When asked by a reporter what would happen if anyone balked, Iacocca tersely explained, “Then the pieces of the mosaic fall off the wall.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The plan worked and Iacocca went on to oversee the creation of the K-Cars, which helped Chrysler turn the corner, and the minivans that, for years, were its most profitable products. He also ordered the purchase of American Motors, which included the Jeep brand that is the money machine for what is today Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Iacocca’s later years with Chrysler were testy, especially when he shifted focus to efforts to save the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. As the automaker started facing new financial problems, he was convinced to retire in 1992. But he attempted a comeback three years later, participating in a failed hostile takeover by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two later reconciled, with Iacocca appearing in several commercials for what was then DaimlerChrysler in 2005, including one with rapper Snoop Dogg who translated Iacocca’s catchphrase, “If you can find a better car, buy it” into “If the ride is more fly, then you must buy.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Iacocca authored a number of books, tried his hand at marketing wine, olive oil and spaghetti sauce, and focused much of his latter-year efforts on charity.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Lee had a touch of the common man,” said Liebler. “He could reach out and talk to people like no one else.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Paul A.

Before they played, both teams observed a moment of silence in Skaggs’ memory. The Angels also wore a patch adorned with his No. 45 and the Rangers skipped the traditional walk-up music when a batter goes to home plate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pitcher's death has stunned the baseball community, especially the Angels.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The team all got together a couple times and some of the guys spoke, but I think most importantly in the end we were able to talk about Tyler and laugh about some of the stories and some of the goofy things he did, listen to some of his music, so it was good,” Angels manager Brad Ausmus told reporters while fighting back tears.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Today’s one of the hardest days and I know it gets easier, but it's difficult,” he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It's like a punch in the heart. You just, you really don't, you're so in shock,” Angels owner Arte Moreno said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s just a tough 24 hours,” Angles superstar center fielder Mike Trout said after the game. “We’re getting through it. Tough playing out there today, but like Brad said earlier, Skaggsy wouldn’t have wanted us to take another day off. The energy he brought to the clubhouse, every time you saw him, he was just picking you up. It’s going to be tough these next couple days, the rest of the season, the rest of our lives, to lose a friend. We were close. All these guys in here, I see these guys more than my family.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Foul play and suicide have been ruled out as cause of death and the medical examiner’s office has finished its initial autopsy report, although Skaggs’ family has requested privacy. His record, which could give a reason for his death, has been taken down from the medical examiner’s website. It could take up to three months before an official autopsy report is released.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Skaggs, who was from suburban Los Angeles, was drafted by the Angels in 2009. He was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks and made his major league debut with them in 2012 before being traded back to his hometown Angels prior to the 2014 season.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Angels beat the Rangers on Tuesday night, 9-4.

Firefighters used a ladder truck to get closer to the flames that erupted from the explosion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Westover said other homes in the vicinity were safe, but some homes nearby received significant damage. An emergency medical services agency, Charlotte Medic, told news outlets that two people living in surrounding homes were being evaluated for injuries that weren't considered life-threatening.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Westover said more than 80 firefighters were at the scene and seven were treated for dehydration.

455,Remembering why Black Lives Matter with Alicia Garza,57,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/remembering-why-black-lives-matter-alicia-garza-podcast-transcript-ncna1013901,2019-07-03,2019,7,3,11,12,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>“Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

Trump heralded the meeting as “wonderful” and an “honor.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But this made-for-TV event will only be remembered as historic if it leads to an agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to fully and permanently give up his rogue nuclear weapons arsenal and ballistic missiles. Otherwise, the meeting is nothing more than a photo opportunity and media spectacle.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And one has to ask, what is really different this time that should make us confident that Trump will succeed when all of his predecessors — going back to President George H.W. Bush — could not? Ultimately, the likelihood that a deal will happen rests solely on an intangible that Trump has brought to the decades-old problem.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">One has to ask, what is really different this time that should make us more confident that will allow Trump to succeed when all of his predecessors — going back to President George H.W. Bush — could not?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite saying otherwise, Trump does not deserve credit for de-escalating war with North Korea. This gross re-writing of history conflicts entirely with the events of 2017, when Trump nearly stumbled into a nuclear war with Kim. He also does not gain kudos for boasting about the spontaneity of his meeting with Kim at the DMZ on Sunday. A week before Trump’s trip to Korea, U.S. officials scheduled to appear at our event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a number of other venues around Washington suddenly became no-shows because they said it was a ""sensitive"" time in North Korea, leading many of us to think something was afoot in the Trump-Kim bromance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump does deserve credit for using the DMZ rendezvous to reset relations after the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/world/asia/trump-kim-jong-un-summit.html"">failed summit in Vietnam</a> four months ago, and for showing persistence in his diplomatic outreach despite recent <a href=""https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/north-korea/2019-05-16/why-north-korea-testing-missiles-again"">North Korean ballistic missile tests</a>. And he finally will allow the working-level experts, who shared the stage at the news conference, to hammer out the details of a deal that might allow for Kim’s visit to the White House, an invitation Trump has already extended.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the DMZ on Sunday, Trump suggested a willingness to loosen sanctions per Kim’s request at the failed Hanoi summit in February. But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25384533/ns/world_news-asia_pacific/t/bush-us-lift-key-north-korea-sanctions/"" target=""_blank"">George W. Bush lifted some sanctions over a decade ago</a> and that did not lead to denuclearization. After the first summit in Singapore in 2018, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/world/asia/south-korea-trump-military-drills.html"" target=""_blank"">Trump suspended military exercises</a> between the U.S. and South Korea as a confidence-building measure for Kim, but President Bill Clinton did the same for two years — from 1994 to 1996 — without a denuclearization outcome. Achieving a mutually agreed upon definition of “denuclearization” between Washington and Pyongyang would certainly move the talks forward, but Bush 41, Clinton and Bush 43 all achieved this with the North Koreans without a successful result.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, the one unique element of the negotiation this time is Trump’s personal campaign to befriend and gain the trust of the young leader. Whether it’s the oversize “love letters,” or Trump giving props to Kim for showing up at the DMZ, it’s extraordinary how the leader of the free world has embraced (literally) the world’s worst dictator. Is this enough to really change the tide of history on the Korean Peninsula?</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Like a CEO trying to close a deal, Trump reached across the table to shake Kim’s hands and looked directly and deeply into his eyes. But Kim did not reciprocate in kind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The answer became clearer as the two men sat next to each other, taking questions from the press. Trump talked about how the leaders’ relationship can achieve great things. Like a CEO trying to close a deal, Trump reached across the table to shake Kim’s hands and looked directly and deeply into his eyes. But Kim did not reciprocate in kind, glancing at Trump, but then averting his gaze, looking away, smiling and nodding to the cameras.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Can an insecure dictator like Kim trust anyone? Indeed, does he even understand the concept of trust when he executes his uncles and murders his siblings? Even then it may be possible, but not likely, with a pathological twister of the truth like Donald Trump. As his career in real estate has shown, Trump is about the most untrustworthy partner one can imagine. Moreover, the start of the presidential campaign in the U.S. reduces the level of interest on both sides to make a deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Trump, an agreement (which will almost certainly be imperfect) will be a target for all of his critics. For Kim, locking in a deal with a potentially outgoing president offers little promise. Given all of these factors, despite the heightened expectations, a bromance between the dictator and the president may make only for good theater.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Victor Cha was deputy head of US delegation for the 2007 denuclearization agreement with North Korea.

457,Instagram travel bragging is killing the family vacation,59,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/instagram-travel-bragging-killing-family-vacation-ncna1024841,2019-07-03,2019,7,3,11,12,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Recently, while comparing notes on <a href=""https://themomhour.com/summer-schedule/"">busy summer schedules</a> with an acquaintance, she sighed. “I’m really hoping to get away this summer, but I don’t know if we can pull it off,” she said. Then, wistfully: “I get so jealous <a href=""https://swissfamilytravel.com/blog/2017/9/7/10-simple-tips-to-help-your-family-travel-photos"">seeing everyone’s travel photos</a>. It’s been so long since our family has been on vacation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was puzzled. The previous month I’d seen photos on this same acquaintance’s Instagram feed of a road trip to visit family in a neighboring state, and just days earlier a weekend excursion to tour museums and a zoo a few hours away.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">This focus on “big” experiences (with the big budgets they often require) can add stress, expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Then I realized that road trips and weekend outings were not what she meant by “getting away” on a “vacation.” No, she meant Vacation with a capital V — somewhere exotic or tropical or at least too far to drive to.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But is a passport required to have an enriching experience? Don’t long weekends, road trips and simple getaways to the beach still count as vacation? I’d argue that they do — and that this focus on “big” experiences (with the <a href=""https://www.foxnews.com/travel/summer-vacation-too-expensive-for-most-americans"">big budgets they often require</a>) can add stress, expectations and a sense of dissatisfaction to something that’s supposed to be a relaxing, enjoyable way to decompress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s no doubt that travel trends have changed since I was a kid in the 1980s. While renting a cabin at the lake for a week was considered the height of recreation for most middle-class families back then, a report from the data and analytics company GlobalData states that the <a href=""https://www.globaldata.com/family-travel-increase-25-2022-says-globaldata/"" target=""_blank"">international market for foreign family travel</a> will grow from 300 million trips in 2017 to 376 million in 2022. It finds that the family travel market is “characterized by increasingly sophisticated and disparate traveller demands,” with the industry having to cater to “consumers who are more than ever used to having tailored products and services available to them.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sophisticated, disparate and demanding; not exactly the kind of family vacation I’m used to. I’m looking for what I remember: a little unscripted, a little bit messy, and focused much more on enjoying our time as a unit rather than anything external. Now families expect to take more complex vacations, created with each person’s wants in mind and defined by buzzwords: Adventure travel! Multigenerational travel! Educational travel! Heritage travel! And because of social media, it’s easy to start getting the idea that everyone except us is taking those trips, and that we — and our kids — are somehow deprived if we don’t.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And if all that keeping-up-with-the-vacationing-Joneses wasn’t exhausting enough, it’s made worse by the fact that we don’t necessarily have the means to actually TAKE the trips we covet — unless we put them on credit, of course.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The personal finance website NerdWallet released <a href=""https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/family-summer-travel-spending-report-2018/"">a report on summer travel plans</a> last year. Of the nearly 1,200 parents surveyed, 71 percent of the parents of children under 18 who planned to take a summer vacation anticipated putting at least part of their vacation expenses — about half, or an average of $1,019 — on a credit card. What, I wonder, does the financial strain of planning a trip you can’t really afford do to your expectation level — and how much can you enjoy your vacation once there? When the bill arrives, do most find that the experience was worth the stress after all?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I spent my childhood in Michigan traveling the old-fashioned middle-class way: road trips to see family, scenic drives around the Great Lakes, camping in the woods or staying in rustic cabins and cottages — and, when I was a teenager, one memorable un-air-conditioned 22-hour drive to Disney World.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">My three siblings and I learned plenty on those trips: how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, i.e., how to wedge several humans into the back of a car while also remembering that it’s just good manners to change your socks daily; how to relax and deal with boredom (nothing a rousing game of highway Bingo or a Beatles sing-a-long wouldn’t fix). We learned about cultural differences, too. (Trust me, there are many ways to live in the United States, and traveling through a location of a different size and geography than yours will teach you all about them.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And we were more or less satisfied with our lot. Sure, I saw families flying to more glamorous locales on the movies and sometimes even TV, like the time “The Brady Bunch” went to Hawaii. But it would never have occurred to me to be jealous of them. Much like perfectly straight blonde hair, a housekeeper named Alice and a backyard made of AstroTurf, vacations like those just weren’t something families like mine had. We accepted that fact, and went about the business of relaxing in a way that suited our parents’ ability to pay for the trip and, often, the family car’s ability to handle the drive.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nowadays, it’s harder to tell what’s “normal” for any particular economic class. Social media has a way of equalizing the families who share photos of their lives, raising the bar for everyone and giving us the idea that going into debt in order to provide our kids with a world-class experience is just “what’s done.” The end result is a skewed idea of what kids — and we adults! — deserve and need.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There have always been families with the means to take their kids skiing in the Alps, on safari, to the rain forests of South America. These days, Instagram makes it easy for us to forget that we don’t all have to be those families — and our kids will just be fine. Speaking of kids, they may be a little easier to please than we think. Mine, at least, have always seemed happy to go on a vacation if it’s offered, but they’re not the ones pushing for an adventure experience in the Galapagos.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Sometimes the least sophisticated trip yields the most fun: Nobody’s expecting to “get” anything out of it but a good time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Exotic opportunities aren’t all bad, and the ones my kids have had have enriched their lives. But sometimes the least sophisticated trip yields the most fun: Nobody’s expecting to “get” anything out of it but a good time, and there’s no pressure to achieve a measurable return on investment.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After all, what is the point of a family vacation? It’s to enjoy one another’s company, right? To get away from the typical routine, to share some experiences, maybe work through some tensions and face a challenge or two. It’s about adding another chapter to your family story, one that we can point back to later and say, “Remember that time we … ?”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The beauty is that those chapters can be written just about anywhere — and can be enjoyed more when we focus on spending time together right now, not what we think those photos will say about us when we post them later on Facebook.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Meagan Francis is a writer, mother of five and co-host of <a href=""http://www.themomhour.com"" target=""_blank"">The Mom Hour podcast</a>.

Peter Parker/Spidey (Tom Holland) heads to Europe on a summer school trip, hoping to ask out classmate<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/hbo-s-euphoria-zendaya-s-chance-shine-controversies-aside-ncna1020776"" target=""_blank""> MJ (Zendaya).</a> While he's there he runs into giant, world-destroying monsters and the superhero Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), who says he's from an alternate earth.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Holland is one of the most appealing MCU leads, and his chemistry with Zendaya is so charming you almost wish Spider-Man didn’t have to constantly rush off to do superheroics. Still, those heroics are very entertaining too, as towering monsters made of water or fire or whatever stampede through various European cities, destroying historic skylines with Godzilla-like glee.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Infinity War” and “Endgame” swathed their fight scenes in doom and dread as fans waited for the next beloved character to die. “Far From Home,” though, knows that the battles are all in good fun; it compares them at many points to fantasy spectacle and entertainment. In one scene, the villains walk through a fight before it happens, figuring out how much damage to do here and which moves to make there; it intentionally evokes a crew working on a special effects sequence. When you go to a superhero movie, you want to see awesome stunts, and that's exactly what “Far From Home” is going to give you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Besides the frothy water and fire monsters, though, “Far From Home” grapples with more down to earth antagonists: drones. Billionaire industrialist and inventor Tony Stark/Iron Man left Peter Parker a pair of glasses which control a global intelligence network. This gives Peter the ability to spy on his friend's texts. It also means he can launch thousands of killer drones.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After Peter almost accidentally targets a classmate and romantic rival for murder by drone, he starts to wonder whether he actually deserves such lethal power. Peter is only 16; his main qualification for controlling a satellite defense network is that he dresses up in spandex, punches giant monsters and was the protégé of an arms manufacturer. You can see Nick Fury's point when the hard-bitten spy (played by Samuel L. Jackson) suggests that the kid isn't ready for the job.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">America produces both Marvel blockbusters and a military-industrial juggernaut that rains down death on individuals halfway across the world via robot.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Nor is it just Peter who may not be ready. The movie connects the giant monster battles and the drone strikes in ways that suggest viewer fascination with the first may create an unfortunate investment in the second. After all, America produces both Marvel blockbusters and a military-industrial juggernaut that rains down death on individuals halfway across the world via robot. Should a country which thrills to scenes of gratuitous destruction also have the power to inflict such carnage on people halfway around the world?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Supposedly, we all know that the superheroes like Mysterio blasting away with green energy are a fantasy. They're just a conglomeration of special effects and acting; they're not real. But is our visceral joy in these displays of power completely harmless? Can you cheer as whole cities are destroyed for giggles without their being any consequences? When we tell ourselves stories about our own righteous destructive power over and over and over, that's bound to have some effect on how we feel about actual superweapons.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Of course, it's not even a spoiler to reveal that the movie validates Peter and his righteous control of drones. This is a superhero movie and he's the hero! The whole point is for him to self-actualize and prove himself worthy. He has great power; he takes great responsibility for it. Superheroes go to war with all the power at their disposal. They're supposed to intervene and blow things up, just as the U.S. is supposed to intervene and blow things up. That's the right thing to do. That's how the narrative works. And at least in Hollywood, that narrative is fun.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And “Far From Home” really is fun, all the way through to the Easter eggs and plot reversals in the multiple after-credits sequences. It is a movie that is fully aware of the joys of illusion, of fantasy and of its audience. It gives fans everything they want, including the knowing wink that none of it is real. But it's also smart enough to know that reality and fantasy aren’t always so easy to separate. What you see affects what you believe. The right director with the right script, the right effects and the right team can even have you cheering for drones.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and cultural critic based in Chicago.

459,Taylor Swift catalog battle reveals dark truth about music industry,61,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-catalogue-battle-about-more-just-music-ncna1025541,2019-07-03,2019,7,3,11,12,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Like many pop stars, Taylor Swift performs empowerment. Her songs — from her triumphant 2012 breakup anthem ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA4iX5D9Z64"">We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</a>"" to 2014's brushoff to the haters ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM"">Shake It Off</a>"" to 2017's ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA"">Look What You Made Me Do</a>"" — often portray her overcoming obstacles and self-actualizing. She's in control of her own image, her own narrative, her own sexuality and her own art. That's part of why pop stars are so inspiring and so appealing to so many — they seem to be free.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This week, though, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/justin-bieber-criticizes-taylor-swift-crossing-line-scooter-braun-post-n1025151"" target=""_blank"">Swift has been talking less</a> about freedom and more about exploitation. She wrote an <a href=""https://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/185958366550/for-years-i-asked-pleaded-for-a-chance-to-own-my"" target=""_blank"">impassioned post on Tumblr</a>, denouncing the music executives Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun after Borchetta's Big Machine Records label — which<a href=""https://www.spin.com/2019/07/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-beef-explained/"" target=""_blank""> released all Swift's album's through 2017's ""Reputation"" </a>— decided to sell Big Machine, including Swift's back catalog, to Braun.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">That's part of why pop stars are so inspiring and so appealing to so many — they seem to be free.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift's accusations, and the counter claims, are <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swifts-masters-scooter-brauns-bullying-inside-the-big-machine-ithaca-holdings-deal-1203256640/"">numerous and complicated</a>. But basically the pop star is angry because she created her music and her albums, and she believes she should be the one who owns them. Instead, a man — who Swift thinks doesn’t have her best interests at heart — owns her work.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The idea that Swift should own the product of her work is an argument that makes powerful intuitive sense. And yet, it's contrary to the working experience of virtually everyone under capitalism. Swift's disagreement with Borchetta highlights the way in which work can be an alienating experience. It also helps to explain why in most cases, for most people, that alienation isn't seen as unjust, even when it should be.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In her Tumblr post, <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/biz/news/taylor-swift-slams-scooter-brauns-acquisition-of-big-machine-as-my-worst-case-scenario-1203256624/"" target=""_blank"">Swift says</a> that Borchetta is selling the ""music I wrote on my bedroom floor and video I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then arenas, then stadiums."" Pop star Halsey <a href=""https://twitter.com/halsey/status/1145435250295635968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1145435250295635968&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Fbiz%2Fnews%2Ftaylor-swift-slams-scooter-brauns-acquisition-of-big-machine-as-my-worst-case-scenario-1203256624%2F"">put the case</a> even more succinctly in a tweet where she said that Swift ""deserves to own the painstaking labor of her heart.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift and Halsey are both describing, in pop terms, the Marxist idea of alienated labor. Karl Marx believed that under capitalism, workers lose control of their labor, which is wrested from them and turned into products and objects that benefit others. ""The object which labor produces — labor’s product — confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer,"" <a href=""https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm"" target=""_blank"">Marx explains</a>. Swift created albums — ""Fearless,"" ""Red,"" ""1989,"" etc. — and those albums are her labor. That labor is packaged and commodified so others can enjoy it — but also exploit it. Braun can even sell it without her consent. Her labor should be hers, but under capitalism it becomes someone else's. That's alienation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Swift's plight is so visible, and so visceral, because we think of work in the arts as uniquely fulfilling, according to <a href=""https://www.fims.uwo.ca/people/profiles/matt_stahl.html"">Matt Stahl</a>, author of ""Unfree Masters: Popular Music and the Politics of Work."" Poets, painters, movie directors and pop stars are idolized in part because they perform unalienated labor. They express their genius, and their ideas authentically, for their own satisfaction and their own profit.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Those albums are her labor. That labor is packaged and commodified so others can enjoy it — but also exploit it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Pop stars like Taylor Swift are narrating their story on behalf of all the people who learn from it and grow with it and identify with it,"" Stahl explains. And that means those stars ""have, if not within their grasp then within their imaginings, the possibility of overturning the relationship of exploitation.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The catch here is that most people not only don't own their labor but aren't in a cultural position to even imagine owning it. Swift can say, ""I should own my albums,"" and it makes instant sense. But if an assembly line worker said, ""I should own my cars,"" or a Walmart employee said, ""I should own my store"" they'd receive substantially less public support, presuming they could even find anyone to listen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In fact, Stahl points out, pop stars themselves exploit the labor of others. Swift talks as if the albums she created are hers and hers alone. But what about the other musicians who played on them? Guitarists, drummers, keyboardists, video directors and mixing engineers all made artistic contributions to Swift's albums and videos. They honed their skills in their own bedrooms on their own time and invested their own money in their own careers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And then their labor goes into the product that is Taylor Swift albums, and their names and contributions are forgotten. Swift ""is an employee who's being exploited for the term of her contract,"" Stahl says. ""And similarly she's an employer who gets to alienate the label of all those people who do the technical, creative and interpretive services that help her do a record or a tour or a video.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The point here isn't that Swift is a hypocrite, or that she shouldn't have control over the product of her labor. Rather, the point is that <em>everyone</em> should have control over the product of their labor. We may notice the injustice in the case of Swift, because we see pop stars and artists as uniquely free. When that freedom is impinged upon, it seems wrong. And it is wrong. But if we want it to be right, we need to free a lot more people than just Taylor Swift.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Noah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and cultural critic based in Chicago.
