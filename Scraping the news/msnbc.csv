2,Trump becomes first sitting U.S. president to step into North Korea,3,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-kim-jong-un-meet-dmz-n1025041,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,donald-trump,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SEOUL, South Korea — Taking an unprecedented step onto North Korean soil, President Donald Trump announced Sunday that Washington and Pyongyang will relaunch stalled nuclear talks. The statement came during an <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank"">extraordinary last-minute meeting with Kim Jong Un</a>, the North Korean leader.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Side-by-side with Kim in the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to cross the 1953 armistice line separating North and South Korea, then joined Kim for a roughly 50-minute meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was their third since Trump took office, but none have yet yielded a nuclear deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Stepping across that line was a great honor,"" Trump said, later adding that it was ""something incredible.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump deemed the meeting a victory, announcing that nuclear talks would resume ""within weeks"" and that the two countries were designating teams of officials to take the lead.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He even invited Kim, who rarely leaves the country, to visit him at the White House.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet for all the fanfare, there were no signs that the U.S. and the North had made any concrete <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-iran-policy-deepening-mistrust-north-korea-experts-say-n1021901"" target=""_blank"">progress on denuclearization</a>, the issue that has led to North Korea's estrangement from the world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And veteran nuclear negotiators and North Korea experts immediately questioned whether Trump, by staging a high-profile photo-op absent nuclear concessions, was bestowing legitimacy on Kim and undermining global pressure to force the North to accept a denuclearization deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We can only call it historic if it leads to something,"" said Victor Cha, a former Asia director at the White House and an NBC News contributor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The meeting capped an unpredictable three days of diplomacy in which Trump, while in nearby Japan for the G-20 summit of world leaders,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank""> issued an invitation to Kim on Twitter to meet him in the DMZ</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea reacted positively, calling the proposal ""interesting,"" but did not confirm that Kim would accept until the last minute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Even as Trump traveled by helicopter to the DMZ accompanied by a massive security contingent, U.S. officials had told NBC News they were unsure whether Kim would really show up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And when he did, his handshake with Trump and their ensuing talks unfolded in chaotic fashion under overcast skies. Journalists jostled to capture the historic encounter and even White House officials accompanying the president seemed unsure what would happen next.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This means that we can feel at ease,"" Kim said of the meeting through a translator. ""I believe that this will have a positive force on all of our discussions in the future.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a nod to the unforeseen nature of their rendezvous in the DMZ, Kim told Trump that he ""never expected” to see the president “at this place.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed mid-afternoon in the DMZ and rushed to a vista overlooking North Korea. Sean Morrow, commander of the U.N. Security Battalion, briefed Trump about the security situation, gesturing toward North Korean territory.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Minutes later, Trump and Kim were side by side posing for photos and taking a step together over the line into North Korea. They then spoke briefly to reporters inside a nearby room before holding talks that Trump had predicted would last just a few minutes but went on for close to an hour.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both leaders predicted it would lead to better things to become between their two countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Of striking a nuclear deal, Trump said: ""We're not looking for speed, we're looking to get it right.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was already the first U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader while in office, having met with Kim twice before. This marks the first meeting in the no-man’s-land between North and South since the end of the Korean War.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-begins-one-one-kim-jong-un-tempering-expectations-n977466"" target=""_blank"">Trump’s last summit with Kim — in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February — collapsed abruptly</a>, with a planned signing ceremony scrapped and Trump explaining to reporters that “sometimes you have to walk.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the center of that failure, U.S. officials have said, was Kim’s insistence that all nuclear sanctions be lifted in exchange for only some concessions sought by the U.S. from Pyongyang related to its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But a senior Trump administration official told NBC News ahead of the meeting Sunday that the administration was hoping that even a handshake might jump-start negotiations at a lower level led by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those talks could then focus on making more substantive progress on the nuclear issues.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Trump said after the meeting that Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be handling the relaunched nuclear talks between the countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And while Trump said that sanctions on the North would remain in place for now, he seemed to leave open the possibility that some could be removed during the talks, a shift from the longstanding U.S. position that all sanctions remain in place until a denuclearization deal is struck.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""At some point during the negotiation, things can happen,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">National security hawks and many of Trump’s critics have warned that such meetings plays into Kim's hands, boosting him domestically and providing room for Pyongyang to continue to stall while it moves ahead with its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads and the ability to mount them on missiles, but has yet to prove it can deliver those nuclear-tipped missiles successfully to distances as remote as the U.S. mainland.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet Trump projected no sense of urgency on Sunday as he argued there was plenty of time to reach a deal with North Korea, echoing an argument he'd made about resolving the Iran nuclear issue the day before.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’m never in a rush,” Trump said. “If you’re in a rush, you get yourself in trouble.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both Trump and Kim offered invitations to the other to visit their capitals, with Trump saying, ""I’ll invite him to the White House right now.” Kim said it would be a “great honor” if Trump visited Pyongyang.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Neither of those are likely to occur in the short term given the immense logistical and security challenges of arranging such a visit between countries that do not have diplomatic relations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet as he talked up his own diplomatic achievements, Trump took significant liberties with history.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said inaccurately that former President Barack Obama had wanted to meet with Kim but been rejected. He also claimed that tensions with the North had dissipated as soon as he took office, when in fact Trump engaged in a war of words with the North — including his threat to unleash “fire and fury” — that caused significant alarm across Asia and beyond.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ve had peace for two and a half years,"" Trump said Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president also glossed over reports that <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-carrying-out-purge-after-n1012251"" target=""_blank"">Kim had ordered some of his negotiators executed</a> following the failed Hanoi summit. Asked whether they were still alive, Trump said ""I think they are,"" adding that the main person the U.S. was familiar with was still living.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I would hope the rest are too,"" Trump said. ""I would really hope the rest are too. ""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier, standing with Moon at the Blue House, South Korea’s equivalent of the White House, Trump said that he and Kim “understand each other, I do believe.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that both he and Kim wanted to hold the meeting “from the beginning.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“He understands me, and I believe I maybe understand him,” Trump said. “Sometimes that can lead to very good things.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moon, a liberal in South Korea’s political world who has pushed hard for more engagement with the North, had said ahead of the Trump-Kim meeting that he planned to let the two leaders meet privately, saying that ""as for an inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen a later time.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea, after all, had publicly admonished South Korea for trying to mediate between it and the U.S.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in the end, Moon did join the U.S. and North Korean leaders for part of their meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has played an unusual role in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy, wrote on Twitter that he was wishing ""my friends"" Trump and Kim ""a very good meeting.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Much love to you both and keep up the wonderful progress!""

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>, <p>Don't miss out.

As Putin smiled broadly, Trump briefly raised his finger toward Putin before turning away and repeating: ""Don’t meddle in the election.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over the din in the meeting room, it was unclear whether Trump had initially said, ""Don't meddle in the election, please,"" or ""Don't meddle in the election, president.""

In her meeting with Putin at the G-20, May also confronted the Russian president on Moscow's actions in Ukraine, LGBT rights and what she called ""irrefutable evidence"" that Russia used a chemical weapon on British soil.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Trump's meeting with Putin got underway, he told reporters they would be discussing trade, disarmament and “a little protectionism, perhaps.” The White House later said they had discussed Iran, Syria and Ukraine and had agreed “that improved relations between the United States and Russia was in each countries’ mutual interest and the interest of the world.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Putin, for his part, said the two leaders had much to discuss in Osaka, noting that they had not seen each other since the Helsinki summit. Still, he said through a translator that their teams had been working together in the interim and said their session in Osaka would be “a great opportunity to follow up on that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two sat side to side in front of Russian and American flags, flanked by their delegation. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump’s senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Accompanying Putin were Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other Russian officials.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A White House description of the meeting later said Trump had told Putin that “a 21st century model of arms control” must include China.

The flowering evergreens that can tower to 85 feet comprise 80 percent of the state’s canopy, covering 1 million acres, and its nectar sustains birds and insects found nowhere else on Earth.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now, public agencies and private citizens are trying to avoid biological and economic catastrophe by proclaiming war against a deadly fungal disease coined “rapid ʻōhiʻa death,” or ROD, that is swiftly destroying the trees. What’s more, invasive species like the miconia tree, native to North and South America and called the “green cancer” of Hawaii’s forests, are choking out the ʻōhiʻa.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The disappearance of these trees would have a major impact on Hawaii,” said Clyde Imada, a botanical research specialist at the <a href=""http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/waipio/index.html"">Bishop Museum</a> of natural and cultural history in Honolulu. “Recreationally, outdoor forest experiences in natural areas will be significantly altered.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Birds, insects and plants will be direly affected,"" he continued. ""The ‘ōhi‘a forest experience can’t be re-created with substitute species.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More than 2 million ʻōhiʻa trees have been killed by ROD, according to the U.S. Forest Service, and about <a href=""https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/rod/THE-DISEASE"">135,000 acres</a> show symptoms of the disease that was first identified on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, in 2014. Two years later, the state <a href=""https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/blog/main/nr-ohiaquarantine/"">imposed a quarantine</a> to prevent ROD from spreading to other islands. It didn’t work. The <a href=""https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/12/22/fungus-behind-rapid-ohia-death-is-spreading-kauai/"">most aggressive form of the fungus was found on Kauai</a> late last year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Manakō Tanaka, a Hawaiian culture expert at the Oahu Visitors Bureau, said the ʻōhiʻalehua tree and its blossoms have always been ""the first to sprout up after lava flows that wipe forests out.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And so it’s become synonymous with the bravest of warriors who were the strongest and first into battle.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tree is also associated with Laka, the goddess of hula, its flower used in leis for the traditional Hawaiian dance. <a href=""https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/03/31/hawaii-news/ohia-lehua-blight-takes-toll-on-hula-competition/"">In 2016, for the first time in more than 50 years, </a>many hula schools were forced to forgo their adornments because of diminishing ʻōhiʻa stock.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It would be heartbreaking to only be able to show pictures of the tree and its flowers to future generations,” Tanaka said. “Losing the ʻōhiʻa lehua would be like losing a reference encyclopedia into the past.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Experts believe the fungus may have been carried to the islands by unwitting tourists, perhaps on their shoes or hiking boots. It can also be transmitted by dirty tools, woodland animals or the wind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is speculation visitors are responsible for bringing this disease to Hawaii Island,” said Sam Gon, senior scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. “Either because they were uninformed or uncaring about the need to sanitize their gear. ROD could have a devastating effect on our environment and economy, and we need to reform tourism practices among visitors.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The federal government has attempted to stop the fungus and tackle invasive species by imposing a quarantine on Hawaii Island and carrying out extensive tests to learn how the fungus spreads, but it has yet to find a solution. Hawaiian organizations, communities and scientists are now stepping in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gunstock Ranch, a horse riding stable and tourist destination on Oahu, is replanting native trees, although not the ʻōhi‘a yet. After conducting a survey on 80 acres of its land in 2016, and finding just two native species, owner Greg Smith established a Hawaiian <a href=""https://gunstockranch.com/hawaiian-legacy-forest/"">“legacy forest,”</a> where visitors can plant trees and monitor their growth online.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Our hope is that as our guests plant and dedicate a tree they will form a new connection to the land and Hawaii and leave knowing that they made a difference,” Smith said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some tourism companies are sending staff members to workshops to learn how to protect native species through improved biological sanitation practices. Joshua Nipp, founder of <a href=""https://www.offthebeatenpath.com/"">Off the Beaten Path</a> travel company, hopes to establish a bio-sanitation certification program for tour operators.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A coalition of state agencies called the <a href=""https://www.cgaps.org/why-should-we-care/"">Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species</a> is pushing for stronger regulations and tracking of biological products entering Hawaii.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tanaka said tourists can play an important role in staving off ROD, particularly on islands like Oahu, which has not yet been infected with the fungus. He said they should always make sure their shoes are clean and free of debris and seeds, and he urged visitors to stay away from areas marked off-limits to protect delicate ecosystems.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is a proverb in Hawaiian, ‘I aliʻi ka ‘āina, i kauā ke kanaka.’ It means, ‘The land is chief, and men are its stewards,’” Tanaka said. “Sometimes, though, I fear that we may be moving to a world where people think it is the other way around.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
14,"As Facebook cracks down on hate speech, it's also re-evaluating another policy: Nipples",15,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-cracks-down-hate-speech-it-s-also-re-evaluating-n1024746,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,tech-news,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The first time Savannah Spirit remembers Facebook censoring her work takes her back to 2011.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was curating a show of erotic art in New York and posted a promotional image to Facebook. The social network promptly took it down, and she was prevented from posting anything else for 10 days.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In the coming years, Spirit, like many other artists, would move to Instagram, where her edgier art — usually with some form of nudity — would often run afoul of the company’s policies and be removed. Complaints and protests from artists and arts organizations in real life and on social media, including at least <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity"">one that went viral</a>, made little progress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I started to decide that it just comes with the territory,” Spirit said of Facebook’s bans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But arts organizations kept at it. In early June, 125 people protested in the nude outside the New York City headquarters of Facebook and Instagram, covering themselves with stickers of photographed male nipples in protest of the long-argued double standard that only female nipples are against the company’s policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The artists’ action speaks to just how important the platforms, especially Instagram, have become to the arts now that Tumblr — once a haven for artists — <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tumblr-ban-all-adult-content-n943226"">does not allow any adult content</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Instagram has been so important for artists, especially those who don’t necessarily have a regular venue for their work,” said Svetlana Mintcheva, director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), an alliance of more than 50 nonprofits. “But they develop huge audiences on Instagram, and photographic artists more so than others.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pressure campaign worked. Facebook said it would organize a group of artists, educators and activists to talk about its policies. It’s a move that is mirrored in the social network’s broader re-evaluation of its content policies as well as its move to find people outside its corporate borders to help rewrite its rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s a start, but the arts community is not declaring victory just yet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t just want to talk,” Svetlana said. “We’d like to see some action, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruchika Budhraja, a spokesperson for Facebook, said the company was committed to meeting with artists, the NCAC and other stakeholders. “It’s important for us to hear directly from different communities who use Facebook and Instagram,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook’s challenges over where to draw the line with nudity in some ways pre-date the now-prominent debate over its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, underscoring how the company’s rules have shifted drastically, often in one direction and then the other, during its meteoric rise.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Facebook banned pornography early on, its efforts to restrict nudity extended to <a href=""https://www.mic.com/articles/90795/how-women-got-facebook-to-tackle-their-nipple-problem"">pictures of breastfeeding</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/facebook-nude-painting-gustave-courbet"">famous French painting</a> of a nude woman and even <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/these-nipples-got-the-new-yorker-banned-from-facebook-5942284"">a New Yorker cartoon</a>. Though the stakes were lower than years later when the company needed to confront issues like fake news and coordinated foreign manipulation campaigns, many activists took the issue no less seriously.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tenacity of the artist community, even years ago, points to just how central both Facebook and Instagram have become to the daily lives of billions of people as well as to the cultures they participate in. And since Facebook would often delete entire accounts along with their work, artists could spend years building up followings only to see them disappear.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It takes years to build up a base of followers, so this is no small deal for artists working with the body,” said Spencer Tunick, an artist <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2008/01/why-doesn-t-spencer-tunick-get-any-respect.html"">known for his use of nudity</a> — particularly groups of naked people — who helped organize the protest in June. “It’s a major issue as we see it now.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tunick credited artist Micol Hebron with being the first person to <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1088838/women-are-putting-male-nipples-over-their-own-to-call-out-censorship-hypocrisy/"">digitize the male nipple</a> in 2014 and encourage the public to use it to fight censorship on social media. He stressed that he understands why Facebook needs to draw lines, but that there are ways for the company to embrace experimental art while protecting younger users.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook has shown some flexibility. Gabriella Mas Bell, a lawyer with the law firm Polsinelli who has <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol54/iss1/24/"">written about Facebook’s censorship</a> of artistic nudity, said that she would have to constantly update her work because the company’s terms of service frequently changed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I was having to go back and change the language in my article, so you could tell that they were really trying to address it,” Bell said. “So I’m not actually that surprised they’re trying to find a better solution as they’re cracking down on things like hate speech and the abusive language.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For now, however, artists still have to be careful. Spirit said she recently had four pictures deleted from Instagram and knows other artists who were recently banned from the platform for 24 hours for posting some of Tunick’s images.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said she’s hopeful that Facebook could finally make changes. All it took was a few dozen nude people outside one of their offices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We got their attention,” she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology news at NBC News Digital.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

One of the biggest problems with the program — as Sanders noted — was that African-American children were being bused at great lengths to attend white schools. The recent school integration debate focuses more heavily on the battle between public and charter schools and on efforts to desegregate communities as a whole.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The busing issue — which Biden figured prominently in as a senator in the 1970s — came to the forefront after Harris pushed him Thursday to address his position. In that exchange, Harris said Biden worked with segregationist senators ""to oppose busing,"" adding that a local busing program allowed her to attend an integrated school and obtain a good education.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden pushed back, saying she mischaracterized his position ""across the board"" and highlighted his broad support of civil rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I did not oppose busing in America,"" Biden said.

The forum's executive director, Chuck Wexler, said an important takeaway was that police departments and other law enforcement agencies must do a better job of capturing and analyzing police suicide data because ""the research is really uneven.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We advocated that agencies should conduct psychological autopsies on suicides and learn what were the circumstances that resulted in these tragedies,"" Wexler said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We don't even know how many people have attempted suicide,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The danger is amplified for officers who are battling depression and mental health issues because they have easier access to weapons, Wexler said. For some officers, he added, the idea of coming forward about their mental health — then having their firearms confiscated for safety — can only make them less likely to speak up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There's no question that what makes police officers at-risk is because they have an occupational need to have a firearm, and in many of these cases, firearms are the way officers take their lives,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a combustible mixture when you have someone who's dealing with some significant personal issues and the availability of a firearm.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean Powers, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD who retired in 2005, said the fear for some officers is not only that their guns could be taken away, but they would be placed on desk assignment or left monitoring surveillance cameras instead of being out on the beat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""You lose your identity,"" he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, 56, became a volunteer with POPPA, the peer-assistance program, with the desire to help his fellow officers, many struggling with trauma from 9/11. Not long after joining POPPA, he said, he got a call from an officer who was threatening to shoot himself in a quiet parking lot outside of a church on Staten Island. In that case, the officer was helped before he could do any physical harm.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the NYPD and the city of New York provides <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/human-resources-info/employee-assistance-unit.page"" target=""_blank"">internal resources to officers</a>, POPPA offers anonymous counseling services outside of the department. And having a fellow officer to turn to can be advantageous over someone unfamiliar with law enforcement policies, Powers said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Sometimes we get cops who really need to vent, and so you understand the lingo and the jargon. You might not have worked at the same exact precinct or done the same exact job, but you know what they're talking about,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, who also has a sister in the NYPD who volunteers with POPPA, knows he has made a difference when he gets Christmas cards from officers thanking him because they decided not to take their own lives and instead spent another holiday with their families.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">After the recent spate of suicides within the NYPD, Powers said, he has reached out to people he knows on the force and asked them to look out for one another.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""It's frustrating seeing this happen in your own backyard,"" he added, ""and you think, 'Why didn't he call?'""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>Editor's note: If you are looking for help, please call the <a href=""https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"" target=""_blank"">National Suicide Prevention hotline</a> at 1-800-273-8255.

So, stock your fridge and freezer and get ready for some serious kitchen inspiration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This dish is easy to throw together on a weeknight with everything I always have in my kitchen: boneless, skinless chicken breasts, fennel, onion and canned tomatoes,” says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur <a href=""https://giadzy.com/"" target=""_blank"">Giada De Laurentiis</a>. It’s a lighter — not to mention speedier — take on an Italian classic. “The breadcrumbs are still there for crunch, but by sprinkling them on top, the prep is even easier and cleaner,” explains De Laurentiis.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For another weeknight-friendly chicken dish, De Laurentiis looks to Tuscany. “These chicken breasts are simple yet delicious.” Plus, most of the supporting ingredients are ones you likely have on hand and the recipe takes just 30 minutes from start to finish. Serving the chicken breasts over spinach “adds balance and makes them a complete meal,” notes De Laurentiis. And if you have fresh spinach, feel free to use it in place of the frozen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This quick, deconstructed salad, from Marge Perry and David Bonom’s cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Dinners-Complete-One-Pan-Meals/dp/0062856065/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hero+dinners&amp;qid=1554233181&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">Hero Dinners: Complete One-Pan Meals That Save the Day</a>"" puts a new spin on a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. “Roasting boneless, skinless breasts to temperature results in juicy, tender chicken — and couldn’t be simpler!” insists Perry. “The key is using an instant-read thermometer and cooking the chicken until it is safe but not overcooked and dry: 160°F.” It’s also essential to let the chicken rest. “If you were to slice the chicken right away, the juices would pour out onto the cutting board, which would result in drier, less tender chicken,” explains Perry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Seasoning chicken breasts with a marinade gives them “a whole new life,” says Nik Sharma, the blogger behind <a href=""http://www.abrowntable.com/"" target=""_blank"">A Brown Table</a> and author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Season-Big-Flavors-Beautiful-Food/dp/1452163995/"" target=""_blank"">Season: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food</a>"". Sharma combines buttermilk, lime juice, serrano chiles, scallions, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, cayenne, coriander, cardamom and cumin and recommends marinating for at least four hours and up to eight. His recipe is “a playful take on fried chicken with a big boost of flavors and a great way to introduce curry leaves to folks that are new to it.” If you’re nervous about frying, don’t be. It’s a lot easier to fry small chunks of chicken than whole, bone-in pieces and Sharma has two handy tips: Cut the chicken into equal size pieces so it cooks evenly and watch the temperature of the oil. Otherwise, there’s nothing to it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This speedy supper, from <a href=""https://andrewzimmern.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Zimmern</a>, the James Beard Award-winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""<a href=""https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/bizarre-foods"" target=""_blank"">Bizarre Foods</a>"", pairs grilled chicken with Panzanella, a traditional Italian bread salad. Zimmern seasons boneless, skinless chicken breasts with garlic, parsley and chives and then gently pounds them, so they can be quickly charred over high heat and will “look beautiful on the plate.” Pounding also makes them tender enough for “fork only” eating. Zimmern’s Panzanella features tomato, basil, fennel, and grapefruit, but he encourages you to improvise with what looks good at the farmers’ market.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I love the unique flavors of this dish and that it’s so easy to pull together,” says Cassy Joy Garcia, the blogger behind <a href=""https://fedandfit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fed + Fit</a> and author of the cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628603437"" target=""_blank"">Cook Once, Eat All Week: 26 Weeks of Gluten-Free, Affordable Meal Prep to Preserve Your Time &amp; Sanity</a>"". Boneless, skinless breasts are generously seasoned with a blend of ginger, cumin, garlic, paprika and turmeric then seared in a hot pan. Next, rice is cooked in the same pan, so it picks up all that great Moroccan-inspired flair. Green olives, lemon wedges and chopped fresh cilantro add a little color and brightness to the final dish.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Chicken is really easy to work with,” insists Garcia, who pairs boneless breasts with homemade roasted garlic pesto and prosciutto. “The pesto and prosciutto offer wonderful flavor, bringing chicken from standard to really exciting,” says Garcia. Plus, “it’s an easy protein to prepare in advance, so you can enjoy it for several meals throughout the week.” Garcia recommends pairing the chicken with simple roasted potatoes and a green salad for a complete feast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Boneless, skinless chicken breasts get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless, but that's because most people overcook and under season the protein, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind <a href=""https://domesticate-me.com/"" target=""_blank"">Domesticate Me</a> and author of the upcoming ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dude-Diet-Dinnertime-Weeknight-Fancypants/dp/0062854704/"" target=""_blank"">The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners</a>"". But, if you season the meat well — even just with salt and pepper —and stick to the suggested cooking time, this lean protein can’t be beat. Sliced or diced breast meat is particularly good in stir-fries, because it cooks quickly and absorbs flavor so well, explains Wolf. To guarantee the chicken stays juicy, Wolf cooks it on its own then adds it back to the pan after the other ingredients are ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For her couldn’t-be-simpler Indian Chicken Tikka Bites, Urvashi Pitre, the blogger behind <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Two Sleevers </a>and the author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Fat-Bombs-Sweets-Treats/dp/0358074304"" target=""_blank"">Keto Fat Bombs, Sweet &amp; Treats: Over 100 Recipes and Ideas for Low-Carb Breads, Cakes, Cookies and More</a>"", uses a marinade of yogurt, garlic, ginger and spices to tenderize and flavor the meat. “You can cook the chicken quickly, but still have a tender little mouthful of spicy goodness,” says Pitre. Her other trick is to cook the chicken in ghee, which is clarified butter. It has a higher smoke point than regular butter, so you can use high heat to sear the chicken.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads with followers by a landslide — 17.7 million for him, versus 7.7 million for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 4.4 million for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, 3.6 million for former Vice President Joe Biden and 3.4 million for California Sen. Kamala Harris. (Several candidates have multiple Twitter accounts, so Socially Mined combined their accounts in this analysis.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Going by “engagement rate” on Twitter, a measure that looks at “likes” and “retweets” on the platform, the leader is Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, followed by Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Warren and Biden.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And looking at “mentions” on the platform, again it’s Sanders with a big lead, with more than 4.1 million mentions, compared to 3.5 million for Biden, 3.3 million for Warren, 2.7 million for Harris and 996,000 for Buttigieg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That's a set of numbers that shows a Democratic Party in the mood for change and perhaps ready to move to the left philosophically. Bernie Sanders leads in two categories. Joe Biden leads in none. And Elizabeth Warren is ahead of Biden in two of the three.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When you look at “sentiment” among Twitter users in the Socially Mined data, the trend becomes even clearer.

Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, Warren, Booker, Sanders and Harris all had a higher percentage of “positive” tweets than Biden in June.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rivals-defend-kamala-harris-against-online-attacks-they-compare-birtherism-n1025031"" target=""_blank"">before you let Twitter sort</a> out the Democratic field completely, consider the latest polls of the enormous Democratic field. Most show Biden with a solid lead over his nearest competitor, and some of the margins are well into the double-digit range.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden leads the field by 15 points in the latest USA Today/Suffolk poll. He’s up by 19 in the Politico/Morning Consult poll. And in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Biden leads by 15 points over the field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yes, those numbers were gathered before this week’s debate, where Harris, in particular, had a good showing and Biden did not. But the social media data above was gathered mostly before the debates as well, from June 1 to June 28.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, this is close to an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of the time frame. Nonetheless, the poll numbers don't match up particularly well with the figures from the 280-character ""debate"" appearing on people's smartphone and web browsers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll offered more evidence that Democratic primary voters are more politically moderate than Twitter might suggest. That survey took a deeper look at those who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primary and it did not find an electorate that was running to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That is a split right down the middle between liberal and moderate/conservative voters, 48 percent for each group.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The NBC News/WSJ poll also doesn't seem to reveal the desire for a drastic remaking of the country. Only 16 percent of those surveyed said Democracy in America needs a complete overhaul. Another 41 percent called for major changes and 32 percent said minor changes would suffice. Meanwhile, 10 percent said it was working pretty well as is.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those are numbers that call for change, hardly a surprise for the party that is out of power in Washington and eager to change the occupant of the White House, but not revolution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It's still early, of course. Things can change quickly, particularly as the debates continue and when the votes begin to be cast. But so far there are two Democratic primary races going on in the public eye: A battle that is primarily taking place on the left in the social media world, and a more moderate view in the larger, offline world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the primary fight continues to keep those two visions of the Democratic electorate in mind.

There have also been <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977"">studies</a> linking processed meats to a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes. “The current evidence suggests the higher intake of processed meat, the higher the risk of chronic diseases and mortality,” says <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/frank-hu/"">Frank B. Hu</a>, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Hu notes that while there is no sufficient evidence to suggest a safe amount, eating a small amount of processed meat occasionally (once or twice a month) is unlikely to have an appreciable health impact.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now that we know that the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-better-choice-hot-dog-or-hamburger-ncna864021"" target=""_blank"">occasional hot dog</a> or strip of bacon isn’t cause for concern, what about a more routine processed meat habit? And what about deli turkey? Is that off the hook? How about meats that claim to have no added nitrates? Those can’t be that bad, can they? To answer these pressing questions, we turned to <a href=""mailto:http://pressroom.cancer.org/colleendoyle"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to send email to Colleen Doyle"">Colleen Doyle</a>, MS, RD, Managing Director, Nutrition and Physical Activity at the American Cancer Society.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Processed meat is a meat that has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it through salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, says Doyle. Think: bacon, sausages, hot dogs, canned meat and other cured meats like salami. And that includes deli meat — whether red (like roast beef or ham) or white (like turkey or chicken).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Unfortunately, we just don’t know. “Many studies don’t differentiate between red and white meat consumption in the subjects, so there are still unanswered questions,” Doyle explains.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When it comes to processed meats, consumers are often concerned with added, synthetic nitrates, which are used to preserve the meats and keep them fresher, longer. If you’re concerned about additives, these more natural-sounding meats might seem appealing. But there’s a catch. Doyle explains that these natural meats (including chicken and turkey) are still processed, and they’re still made with nitrates. “They use natural sources of preservatives,” she says. “Many companies are using celery powder, celery juice or celery salt, which are high in nitrates. They can still label their product ‘nitrate-free’, because those are natural and not synthetic, but they are nitrates nonetheless.” In other words, once you ingest deli turkey or chicken or ham made with celery powder or another natural preservative, you’re still consuming nitrates — it’s just in a different form. “Unfortunately, we just don’t know yet whether these have the same impact as synthetic sources of nitrates.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’ve got a lot of bacon-loving friends who ask me this all the time!” says Doyle. Unfortunately, this is another big question mark. “It isn’t known whether there is a safe level of consumption for processed meat — or for unprocessed red meat,” she says. (Unprocessed red meat, like hamburger and steak, has also been linked to health problems.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle understands the popularity of these snacks as they’re approved for many trendy eating patterns (like <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/best-weight-loss-advice-borrow-popular-diets-ncna926246"">paleo</a> and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keto-diet-it-right-you-ncna847256"">keto</a>), and they’re a portable option for people on the go. However, make no mistake. “They’re still processed meats (and tend to be high sodium), so I’d still advise people limit them,” she says. According to Hu, regular consumption of these foods is not considered a healthy dietary choice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle says that while she hasn’t seen studies specifically calling out smoked salmon, it definitely meets the definition of processed. “And, it’s pretty high in sodium. Bottom line for this and all processed meats: It would be smart to eat fish, poultry and beans over red (unprocessed) meat, and for individuals who do consume processed meat products, to do so sparingly, if at all.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If your mind is spinning with this info and your regular lunch routine or <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/healthy-travel-snacks-ncna1021666"" target=""_blank"">on-the-go snack</a> now feels a little less healthy, here are some ideas for replacing processed meats with whole foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Want more tips like these?

24,Scientists are searching for a mirror universe. It could be sitting right in front of you.,25,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/scientists-are-searching-mirror-universe-it-could-be-sitting-right-ncna1023206,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,science,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee, physicist Leah Broussard is trying to open a portal to a parallel universe.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She calls it an “oscillation” that would lead her to “mirror matter,” but the idea is fundamentally the same. In a series of experiments she plans to run at Oak Ridge this summer, Broussard will <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00767"" target=""_blank"">send a beam of subatomic particles down a 50-foot tunnel</a>, past a ring of powerful magnets and into an impenetrable wall. If the setup is just right — and if the universe cooperates — some of those particles will transform into mirror-image versions of themselves, allowing them to tunnel right through the wall. And if that happens, Broussard will have uncovered the first evidence of a mirror world right alongside our own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s pretty wacky,” Broussard says of her mind-bending exploration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The mirror world, assuming it exists, would have its own laws of mirror-physics and its own mirror-history. You wouldn’t find a mirror version of yourself there (and no evil Mister Spock with a goatee — sorry ""Star Trek"" fans). But current theory allows that you might find mirror atoms and mirror rocks, maybe even mirror planets and stars. Collectively, they could form an entire shadow world, just as real as our own but almost completely cut off from us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard says her initial search for the mirror world won’t be especially difficult. “This is a pretty straightforward experiment that we cobbled together with parts we found lying around, using equipment and resources we already had available at Oak Ridge,” she says. But if she unequivocally detects even a single mirror particle, it would prove that the visible universe is only half of what is out there — and that the known laws of physics are only half of a much broader set of rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“If you discover something new like that, the game totally changes,” Broussard says.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As with many grand scientific quests, the hunt for mirror matter <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/"" target=""_blank"">grew out of a small, seemingly esoteric mystery</a>. Starting in the 1990s, physicists developed high-precision experiments to study how neutrons — particles found in the nuclei of atoms — break down into protons, a process related to radioactivity. But those experiments took a strange turn.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers found that neutrons created in particle beams, similar to the one Broussard will use, last 14 minutes and 48 seconds, on average, before “decaying” into protons. But neutrons stored in a laboratory bottle seem to break down a bit faster, in 14 minutes and 38 seconds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ten seconds might not sound like much, but the actual difference should be zero: All neutrons are exactly the same, and their behavior should depend not one bit on where or how they are examined.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I take discrepancy very seriously,” says Benjamin Grinstein, a particle-physics expert at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just between two experiments. It is a collection of many experiments done independently by several groups. The newest experiments, conceived in part to resolve the disagreement, <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627"" target=""_blank"">have “only made it worse,”</a> he adds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Grinstein has explored the possibility that some neutrons are unexpectedly breaking down into particles other than protons but has found nothing so far. Mirror matter offers a more elegant, if somewhat bizarre, explanation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A decade ago, Anatoli Serebrov of Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia introduced the idea that ordinary neutrons sometimes cross over into the mirror world and transform into mirror neutrons. At that point, we could no longer detect them — it would be as if some of the neutrons simply vanished. “That would make the neutron lifetime look wrong,” Broussard explains, because some of the neutrons would have been disappearing from the test equipment while the researchers were studying them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Connect the dots, and you reach a far-out conclusion: The neutron experiments might look screwy because physicists unwittingly opened a portal to the mirror world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard’s goal is to find out if that portal really exists and, if so, to open it in a methodical way. That’s where her neutron beam and impenetrable wall come in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Oak Ridge has an 85-megawatt <a href=""https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir"">nuclear reactor</a> that can shoot out billions of neutrons on demand, so getting enough raw material to work with isn’t an issue. The hard part is figuring out how to make some of the neutrons cross over into the mirror world, and then prove to her skeptical colleagues (and to her skeptical self) that it really happened.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Running the experiment will take about one day. Collecting the data and weeding out every possible source of error might then take a few weeks more. Broussard is looking for any telltale neutrons that managed to get past the barrier by turning into mirror neutrons, then turning back. “It all comes down to: Are we able to shine neutrons through a wall?” she says. “We should see no neutrons” according to conventional physics theory. If some of them show up anyway, that would suggest that conventional physics is wrong, and the mirror world is real.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meanwhile, Klaus Kirch is working on a complementary experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Zurich. His plan is to capture slow-moving neutrons, hit them with a magnetic field and then count to see if all the particles are still there. “If some neutrons oscillated into mirror-neutrons, they would disappear from our apparatus,” he says. Kirch's team has already run the experiment and hopes to have their results analyzed later in the summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite their conceptual simplicity, both Broussard’s and Kirch’s experiments are extremely delicate undertakings, dependent on assessing the strange behavior of a few subatomic particles within a crowd of billions. Other researchers have proposed that there might be more blatant signs of a mirror world. We might be seeing it everywhere in the sky.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the 1970s, astronomers have deduced that the universe is packed full of “<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-dark-matter-ncna871991"">dark matter</a>,” a substance that cannot be observed directly but whose powerful gravitational pull helps keep galaxies from flying apart. The latest analyses indicate that dark matter outweighs visible matter by a factor of five. Yet dozens of intensive searches by astronomers around the world have failed to identify what dark matter is made of.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Zurab Berezhiani, a physicist at the University of L’Aquila in Italy who has conducted his own <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6189-y"">mirror neutron searches</a>, offers an intriguing explanation: Dark matter has been hard to find because it is hidden away in the mirror world. In this view, dark matter and mirror matter are one and the same. If so, the mirror world is not just ubiquitous, it is far more massive than our own. At a recent physics conference, Berezhiani <a href=""http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/17-69W/"">expanded on the idea</a>, outlining a possible parallel reality full of mirror stars, mirror galaxies and mirror black holes. Maybe even dark life?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Dark people is probably a bit farfetched,” says Broussard, who confesses that these ideas push her right to the edge of her comfort zone. “But dark matter is very likely as rich as our own matter. This kind of thing needs to be explored.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If she can open a passage to the mirror world at Oak Ridge, that will be one heck of a start.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

30,"For companies, LGBTQ-inclusive ads weren't always risk-free",31,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/companies-lgbtq-inclusive-ads-weren-t-always-risk-free-n1024971,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,15,38,nbc-out,"[<p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the U.S. — and many other parts of the world — celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall uprising, rainbow flags and LGBTQ-inclusive ad campaigns appear to be omnipresent, especially in big cities. The ubiquity of these Pride campaigns make it easy to forget that this was not always the case. While many point to corporate America’s embrace of LGBTQ inclusivity as a major sign of progress, others believe corporations are coopting the movement.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Advertisements geared toward gay and lesbian consumers began to appear in earnest in the 1970s, inspired in part by the energy of the Stonewall uprising, which is widely considered the spark that fueled the modern LGBTQ movement.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So-called “sin” products, like alcohol and tobacco, were the first marketed to gays. These companies had little or nothing to lose from a potential boycott by the religious right, according to Katherine Sender, a communications professor at Cornell University and author of “Business, Not Politics: The Making of the Gay Market.”</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f8"">""Now, getting a gay boycott is a much worse thing than getting a boycott from the religious right.""</p>, <p class=""founders-mono f3 lh-title mv0 ttu""><cite class=""fs-normal black"">Professor Katherine Sender</cite><span class=""gray-80""></span></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Absolut vodka was the first brand to build itself with an eye toward the gay market, featuring full-page ads in gay outlets, such as The Advocate. Other alcohol brands like Boodles Gin ran ads in gay publications, but most ad revenue came from local gay bars and businesses.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, with the exception of Absolut, much of the advertising aimed explicitly at gays came to a halt in the 1980s because of the HIV/AIDS crisis and the stigma surrounding the disease.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Things changed in the 1990s. Marketing surveys, namely the 1988 Simmons Market and the 1990 Overlooked Opinions survey, presented an image of gays and lesbians as an affluent, untapped market. Marketers estimated the total annual income of the gay community at over $500 billion. The surveys, however, were not representative and helped to start what researchers have since described as the “myth of gay affluence.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In 1994, Ikea launched the first television ad to feature a gay couple. In the commercial, the two men tease each other about their taste in furniture.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I remember it extremely well, because it was radical,” said Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, a firm specializing in LGBTQ marketing. The couple “behaved in every sense like a married couple, and it was radical because it was normal and natural,” he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Not everyone loved the ad. In fact, the backlash was swift and strong. The American Family Association staged a boycott, and an Ikea store in New York received a bomb threat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That same year, AT&amp;T launched a direct-marketing mail campaign, making them the first US phone company to openly target lesbian and gay customers (MCI ran an earlier campaign, but used suggestive statements and imagery rather than a direct appeal).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“They got a big pushback from the religious right,” Sender said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Companies remained more focused on gay men, though a notable exception was Subaru. In the late ‘90s, Subaru undertook a very successful lesbian-focused marketing campaign after research revealed its sturdy, practical cars appealed to this demographic. “It’s not a choice, it’s the way we’re built,” a 2000 print ad boasted.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This new interest in the “pink dollar” coincided with a massive increase in gay and lesbian visibility in the media. Ellen came out on TV in 1997, which Sender called “a massive deal.” Shows like “The L Word,” “Queer as Folk” and “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” ushered images and information about gays and lesbians into homes across the country.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite the increased visibility and a number of successful ad campaigns, even into the early 2000s mainstream companies still risked a backlash for gay and lesbian inclusivity, according to Sender. Many companies were still afraid to be labeled as selling a “gay product.” Representation of transgender people was almost always negative, relying on transphobic tropes of deceit or mistaken identity, according to Sender’s research.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rich Ferraro, chief communications officer at GLAAD, a national LGBTQ media advocacy organization, has been consulting on LGBTQ images in advertising since 2008. He sees a very different media landscape today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The backlash that once occurred if a brand had LGBTQ marketing campaigns is no longer,” Ferraro wrote in an email. “For instance, fringe organizations like Family Research Council, National Organization for Marriage and One Million Moms would start petitions (which never really reached large numbers), but now they do not.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sender agreed, saying, “Now, getting a gay boycott is a much worse thing than getting a boycott from the religious right.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More and more companies are engaging in LGBTQ-inclusive advertising, Ferraro said. “Categories have exploded — spirits and travel were typically leaders in LGBTQ-inclusive campaigns, but now it’s retail, cars, banking and financial services, food and beverages, youth-oriented brands,” he explained.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Witeck said “there is probably no more efficient way to say we are a contemporary brand” than to make your ad campaigns LGBTQ-inclusive.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For legacy brands, like Coca Cola, they must always be refreshed and made relevant, Witeck added. “LGBTQ marketing is an effective way to say, ‘We get it. We look and talk and act like we are in the 21st century.’”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">However, Sender said that LGBTQ consumers are not only looking for inclusion in campaigns, but are holding companies accountable in their employment and production practices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Now, people are asking more questions, particularly around transgender polices and health care,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What constitutes the responsibility of the advertising companies is expanding in ways that are really quite powerful,” Sender added, noting that consumers are asking questions like, “Are they buying products or services or in countries that have extremely bad policies and legal enforcement around LGBTQ people?”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Because of their resources, companies are also in a position to exert powerful political influence if they want to. Witeck mentioned the <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/27/bathroom-bill-to-cost-north-carolina-376-billion.html"">corporate boycotts</a> of North Carolina after the passage of HB2 (the so-called “bathroom bill) that helped to precipitate its repeal and major companies’ <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/blog/56-major-companies-respond-to-effort-to-erase-transgender-people-from-legal"">outspoken support</a> for transgender equality.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While historically there has been much less representation of transgender and gender-nonconforming individuals, this year examples of such campaigns abound:<a href=""https://www.express.com/blog/features/raquel-willis-love-unites""> Raquel Willis for Express</a> on a Times Square billboard,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/dad-shows-transgender-son-how-shave-viral-gillette-ad-n1010891""> Gillette’s commercial</a> featuring a young trans man and his dad, and<a href=""https://www.uber.com/blog/north-america/pride-2019/""> Uber running a campaign</a> featuring trans, genderqueer and bisexual pride flags.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Traditionally, one or two campaigns are inclusive of transgender people, now it is a norm,” Ferraro said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Kristin Comeforo, associate professor of communications at Hartford College, worries that advertisers often take a “check-the-box approach” to the inclusion of gender and racial diversity, rather than a genuine engagement with intersectional experiences.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She also worries that corporate sponsorship can silence the voices of LGBTQ people who face intersectional marginalization.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sender agreed, noting that “the 50th anniversary of Stonewall is such a big deal everyone wants a piece of that.” As a result, she added, Pride marches have become “a party for everybody.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“What gets left behind are the very real struggles of LGBTQ people in this country — trans people in particular and people of color facing multiple layers of discrimination,” she added. “This ‘party’ suggests that being gay is just an excuse to have a lovely time, but there is still a long way to go.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">FOLLOW <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out"">NBC OUT</a> ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCOUT"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCOUT/?fref=ts"">FACEBOOK</a> &amp; <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/nbcout/"">INSTAGRAM</a></p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

But while June has become a month-long celebration for many, it’s apparent that we currently have two different prides occurring.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While rainbows are replacing corporation logos across the nation, Black folks like myself are attending rallies for the death of our trans sisters — most recently <a href=""https://www.theroot.com/activists-demand-justice-for-layleen-polanco-a-black-t-1835379347"">Layleen Polanco Xtranveganza</a>, who was found dead in her jail cell in Rikers Island, and <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/trans-women-killed-fairmount-heights"">Zoe Spears</a>, who was shot to death on June 15. Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates.

Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color.

This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Of course you haven’t; I never would either. Except that I have so many times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is another one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Take <a href=""https://www.rawstory.com/2017/10/sci-fi-writer-baffles-abortion-foes-with-simple-question-would-you-save-1000-embryos-or-one-child-in-fire/"" target=""_blank"">this thought experiment by Patrick Tomlinson</a>: “You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled, ‘1000 Viable Human Embryos.’ The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die - saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no C. ‘C’ means you all die.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is a hypothetical ultimately meant to test whether one truly believes that life begins at conception and a human embryo has the same value as the life of a child standing before you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Historically in philosophical inquiries of this kind where, say, the choice is between pulling a lever on a speeding train that would kill one man to avoid a collision that would kill five, <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that 90 percent of people choose to save more people at the expense of one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, I used to think that I was landing a rhetorical deathblow when discussing Tomlinson's scenario and it becomes undeniable that no one can really say in earnest that 1,000 embryos are equal to the life of an actual child when danger looms. And I must admit, I am usually waiting for the victorious moment where I say something like, “Seems like you’re struggling. Do you really believe these embryos are actual kids? If you really did believe that, it wouldn't be that hard of a choice for one kid to burn and you are clearly just a woman-hating-liar-fraud with twisty snakes for brains and cleverly hidden horns. Hahahahaha! I gotcha!""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don’t actually say that, but, in my head, I smile beatifically while ascending onto imaginary stage at a strip mall where to be awarded a medal by the ghosts of famous feminists; I can’t wait for ""pro-lifers” to squirm and repent under the irrefutable mirror I feel I am holding up to their dogmatic moral confusion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s gross to admit, but that’s what I’m doing. I have long since ceased to listen, in any meaningful way, to the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what I realized writing this is that I’ve been telling the story wrong the whole time. The way I have been telling it, there is a grown woman behind the clinic door crying for help, instead of the five-year-old child. I smugly misremembered that’s how the story went and I never checked again. The original thought experiment using the child is much more effective in uncovering where our allegiances lie in terms of where life begins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in this culture war, it was just as easy to imagine it as a choice between a live woman or the embryos. That's how it feels, and that’s how I heard it. Telling it that way forces whomever I am sparring against to admit that their stance on the issue is not complicated at all. They must value the tangible life of an individual adult woman over the ambiguously defined potential in the box. If they don’t, they have a clear disdain for women — even, and especially, if they are one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I have been pitting women against each other with my strident lecturing. I have chosen to believe that it isn't difficult to reconcile this hypothetical choice with their actual religious beliefs or their lived experiences, that they should just know it’s only wrong to leave the woman to the fire. (And it might be, but that’s not the point.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In my quest to protect the autonomy and freedom of women, I have become the ultimate conversation stopper. There is nothing to which I don’t have a counterargument, no silence I can’t fill with more statistics. In my head at these moments, I'm wearing a Katherine Hepburn lawyer-type outfit with <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a20874652/sophie-ratner-1973-necklace-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">a 1973 necklace</a> on to represent Roe v. Wade — trust me, it screams ""very confident."" But these are not the actions of a confident woman.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, truthfully, my rhetoric is the reaction of a throaty wild animal sensing the fire. I can feel the room getting smaller and filling with smoke. I am the woman trapped in the fire. I’m sure that the people that burst in the door will choose the theoretical in the refrigerated box over the real woman pleading and coughing in front of them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">How can I become a better listener if I am this afraid? Can we afford to put down our weapons for a moment in this stand off? Do we do it on the count of three? How can I trust you? Or how can you trust me when I have hijacked the conversation and made you my hostage?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Aspen Baker, founder of the women empowering nonprofit group <a href=""https://exhaleprovoice.org"" target=""_blank"">Exhale</a> created a platform/philosophy called “Pro- Voice” that seeks to bridge this battleground. It has only two tenets: That people should listen and share stories. <a href=""http://www.aspenbaker.com/what-is-pro-voice"" target=""_blank"">Her website says</a>, ""Pro-voice focuses on the all-to-often ignored or exploited personal experiences with abortion."" In a 2015 TED Talk, <a href=""https://blog.ted.com/be-pro-voice-aspen-baker-flips-the-conversation-on-abortion-at-tedwomen-2015/"" target=""_blank"">she expanded on that idea</a>: ""The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic grateful for hers... Personal abortion stories don't fit neatly into one camp or the other.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another organization I love called “<a href=""https://www.aisfor.org/"" target=""_blank"">A is For</a>,"" and it seeks to fund access for all reproductive care and to end the obstructions preventing it. But, they also seek to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by sharing stories. Recently, as more anti-abortion bills were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, Utah, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, A is For gathered and shared the stories of women living in those states, no matter what side of the issue they favored.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sharing stories, and the empathy of real listening might be the only thing that has ever touched a heart or changed a mind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If gentle listening, if really telling and hearing stories could disarm the bomb that begins ticking on this battleground every time the opposing sides meet, why do I still have a secret gun, a detonator in my pocket and a knife in my boot? Because another gross thing to admit is that I’m not ready to do what I espouse. I’d rather show you the other versions of this article that are, in fact, ticking and armed with explosions of my rightness. Just me feeling very right over and over! (And I'm wearing the Katherine Hepburn lawyer- type outfit, duh.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the true story that we need to hear is that <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states"" target=""_blank"">one in four American women will have an abortion by age 45</a> and we need to listen to them — as well as the women who chose differently. Barbara Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer and badass Appalachian woman after my heart <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/now/printable/transcript_kingsolver_print.html"" target=""_blank"">once said</a>, “Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It is the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, even though I am scared and prideful, I am offering to lay down my weapons so that I can listen to the stories — all of them, not just the ones that fit my perspective. Will you join me?

""Be proud of the Flag that you wear.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was reacting to a new viral video in which Rapinoe, asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT/status/1143918087735054336"">months ago</a> whether she would visit the White House if invited by the president, responded casually: “Pfft. I’m not going to the f------ White House.” Rapinoe isn’t alone either — teammates Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger and Becky Sauerbrunn have all shared similar sentiments publicly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Apparently to Trump, this means that Rapinoe and her highly decorated teammates don’t respect their country and aren’t patriotic enough.

They were demanding a living wage so they don’t need second jobs, a calendar of regular games to stay sharp and protections so if players get injured (or pregnant) their careers wouldn’t be stuck in limbo — benefits their male counterparts already enjoyed. Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts.

The statement came during an <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank"">extraordinary last-minute meeting with Kim Jong Un</a>, the North Korean leader.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Side-by-side with Kim in the heavily-fortified demilitarized zone, Trump became the first sitting U.S. president to cross the 1953 armistice line separating North and South Korea, then joined Kim for a roughly 50-minute meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was their third since Trump took office, but none have yet yielded a nuclear deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Stepping across that line was a great honor,"" Trump said, later adding that it was ""something incredible.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump deemed the meeting a victory, announcing that nuclear talks would resume ""within weeks"" and that the two countries were designating teams of officials to take the lead.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He even invited Kim, who rarely leaves the country, to visit him at the White House.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet for all the fanfare, there were no signs that the U.S. and the North had made any concrete <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-s-iran-policy-deepening-mistrust-north-korea-experts-say-n1021901"" target=""_blank"">progress on denuclearization</a>, the issue that has led to North Korea's estrangement from the world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And veteran nuclear negotiators and North Korea experts immediately questioned whether Trump, by staging a high-profile photo-op absent nuclear concessions, was bestowing legitimacy on Kim and undermining global pressure to force the North to accept a denuclearization deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We can only call it historic if it leads to something,"" said Victor Cha, a former Asia director at the White House and an NBC News contributor.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The meeting capped an unpredictable three days of diplomacy in which Trump, while in nearby Japan for the G-20 summit of world leaders,<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-tweets-invitation-kim-jong-un-meet-demilitarized-zone-n1024861"" target=""_blank""> issued an invitation to Kim on Twitter to meet him in the DMZ</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea reacted positively, calling the proposal ""interesting,"" but did not confirm that Kim would accept until the last minute.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Even as Trump traveled by helicopter to the DMZ accompanied by a massive security contingent, U.S. officials had told NBC News they were unsure whether Kim would really show up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And when he did, his handshake with Trump and their ensuing talks unfolded in chaotic fashion under overcast skies. Journalists jostled to capture the historic encounter and even White House officials accompanying the president seemed unsure what would happen next.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""This means that we can feel at ease,"" Kim said of the meeting through a translator. ""I believe that this will have a positive force on all of our discussions in the future.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a nod to the unforeseen nature of their rendezvous in the DMZ, Kim told Trump that he ""never expected” to see the president “at this place.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in landed mid-afternoon in the DMZ and rushed to a vista overlooking North Korea. Sean Morrow, commander of the U.N. Security Battalion, briefed Trump about the security situation, gesturing toward North Korean territory.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Minutes later, Trump and Kim were side by side posing for photos and taking a step together over the line into North Korea. They then spoke briefly to reporters inside a nearby room before holding talks that Trump had predicted would last just a few minutes but went on for close to an hour.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both leaders predicted it would lead to better things to become between their two countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Of striking a nuclear deal, Trump said: ""We're not looking for speed, we're looking to get it right.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was already the first U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader while in office, having met with Kim twice before. This marks the first meeting in the no-man’s-land between North and South since the end of the Korean War.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-begins-one-one-kim-jong-un-tempering-expectations-n977466"" target=""_blank"">Trump’s last summit with Kim — in Hanoi, Vietnam, in February — collapsed abruptly</a>, with a planned signing ceremony scrapped and Trump explaining to reporters that “sometimes you have to walk.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At the center of that failure, U.S. officials have said, was Kim’s insistence that all nuclear sanctions be lifted in exchange for only some concessions sought by the U.S. from Pyongyang related to its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But a senior Trump administration official told NBC News ahead of the meeting Sunday that the administration was hoping that even a handshake might jump-start negotiations at a lower level led by Stephen Biegun, the U.S. special representative for North Korea.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those talks could then focus on making more substantive progress on the nuclear issues.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Trump said after the meeting that Biegun and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be handling the relaunched nuclear talks between the countries.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And while Trump said that sanctions on the North would remain in place for now, he seemed to leave open the possibility that some could be removed during the talks, a shift from the longstanding U.S. position that all sanctions remain in place until a denuclearization deal is struck.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""At some point during the negotiation, things can happen,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">National security hawks and many of Trump’s critics have warned that such meetings plays into Kim's hands, boosting him domestically and providing room for Pyongyang to continue to stall while it moves ahead with its nuclear program.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea is believed to have dozens of nuclear warheads and the ability to mount them on missiles, but has yet to prove it can deliver those nuclear-tipped missiles successfully to distances as remote as the U.S. mainland.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet Trump projected no sense of urgency on Sunday as he argued there was plenty of time to reach a deal with North Korea, echoing an argument he'd made about resolving the Iran nuclear issue the day before.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’m never in a rush,” Trump said. “If you’re in a rush, you get yourself in trouble.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Both Trump and Kim offered invitations to the other to visit their capitals, with Trump saying, ""I’ll invite him to the White House right now.” Kim said it would be a “great honor” if Trump visited Pyongyang.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Neither of those are likely to occur in the short term given the immense logistical and security challenges of arranging such a visit between countries that do not have diplomatic relations.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yet as he talked up his own diplomatic achievements, Trump took significant liberties with history.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said inaccurately that former President Barack Obama had wanted to meet with Kim but been rejected. He also claimed that tensions with the North had dissipated as soon as he took office, when in fact Trump engaged in a war of words with the North — including his threat to unleash “fire and fury” — that caused significant alarm across Asia and beyond.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ve had peace for two and a half years,"" Trump said Sunday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The president also glossed over reports that <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/north-korea-s-kim-jong-un-carrying-out-purge-after-n1012251"" target=""_blank"">Kim had ordered some of his negotiators executed</a> following the failed Hanoi summit. Asked whether they were still alive, Trump said ""I think they are,"" adding that the main person the U.S. was familiar with was still living.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I would hope the rest are too,"" Trump said. ""I would really hope the rest are too. ""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier, standing with Moon at the Blue House, South Korea’s equivalent of the White House, Trump said that he and Kim “understand each other, I do believe.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">He said that both he and Kim wanted to hold the meeting “from the beginning.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“He understands me, and I believe I maybe understand him,” Trump said. “Sometimes that can lead to very good things.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Moon, a liberal in South Korea’s political world who has pushed hard for more engagement with the North, had said ahead of the Trump-Kim meeting that he planned to let the two leaders meet privately, saying that ""as for an inter-Korean dialogue, this will happen a later time.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">North Korea, after all, had publicly admonished South Korea for trying to mediate between it and the U.S.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in the end, Moon did join the U.S. and North Korean leaders for part of their meeting.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has played an unusual role in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy, wrote on Twitter that he was wishing ""my friends"" Trump and Kim ""a very good meeting.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""Much love to you both and keep up the wonderful progress!""

Today, justices <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-agrees-hear-daca-case-win-trump-administration-n1020481"" rel=""nofollow"">agreed to do exactly that</a>.</p>, <p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide the fate of DACA, the federal program that has allowed 700,000 young people – known as “Dreamers” – to avoid deportation.</p>, <p>The court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p>, <p>The calendar is politically significant: if the justices hear oral arguments in the case in the fall or winter, we’ll likely see a ruling around this time next year. Or put another way, the Supreme Court will likely issue its ruling on protections for Dreamers just as the major-party presidential nominating conventions are poised to get underway.</p>, <p>For those who need a refresher, it’s worth considering the chain of events that brought us to this point. Barack Obama announced DACA protections for Dreamers shortly after the 2014 midterms, and the program worked exactly as intended – right up until Donald Trump was elected.</p>, <p>As regular readers may <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">recall</a>, Candidate Trump vowed to pursue mass deportations, without exceptions. In a not-so-subtle shot at Dreamers, the Republican <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-recommits-mass-deportation-fiery-immigration-speech-n641016"" rel=""nofollow"">vowed</a>, “[U]nlike this administration, no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement.” This followed related comments in which he <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/trump-s-daca-move-could-end-dividing-both-parties-n798696"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a> Dreamers “have to go.”</p>, <p>As president, however, Trump seemed to realize how radical a posture this was. A few months into his term, the Republican said Dreamers should “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/trump-administration-cant-keep-its-story-straight-dreamers"">rest easy</a>” about his immigration policies. Trump told the Associated Press at the time that he’s “not after the Dreamers, we are after the criminals.”</p>, <p>In September 2017, the administration changed course again, “<a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/sessions-trump-admin-has-rescinded-protections-dreamers"">rescinding</a>” the program and its protections for the young immigrants.</p>, <p>For Trump, their fate became a bargaining chip, with the president telling congressional Democrats that the only way to save the Dreamers was to agree to finance a giant border wall. The gambit failed spectacularly for two reasons. First, when Dems grudgingly agreed to pay the ransom, the president <a href=""/rachel-maddow-show/the-immigration-deal-trump-shouldve-taken-didnt"">balked</a> and demanded even more concessions.</p>, <p><a id=""break"" name=""break""></a></p>, <p>And second, several federal courts ended up blocking Trump’s attempt, ruling that the administration couldn’t scrap the DACA protections, and in the process, taking the president’s political hostages away.</p>, <p>For now, Dreamers are safe, but the White House is far from satisfied with the status quo – which is why Team Trump appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>, <p>With a five-member conservative majority, including two justices the president handpicked for the nation’s highest bench, Trump probably likes his chances.</p>, <p>Don't miss out.

Then he called it a ""great honor"" to be with Putin, praising their ""very, very good relationship"" and predicting ""a lot of very positive things"" would result.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As reporters shouted questions and cameras clicked, Trump cocked his head when asked by NBC News whether he would tell Putin not to interfere in the vote next year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""The answer to the question is, of course I will. 'Don’t meddle in the election,'"" Trump said. As Putin smiled broadly, Trump briefly raised his finger toward Putin before turning away and repeating: ""Don’t meddle in the election.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Over the din in the meeting room, it was unclear whether Trump had initially said, ""Don't meddle in the election, please,"" or ""Don't meddle in the election, president."" Journalists in the room and watching video of the exchange heard him say ""please,"" but a White House transcript later maintained that Trump had said ""president.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Either way, Trump’s casual comments to Putin were unlikely to satisfy his critics, who have lambasted him for <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-putin-discussed-mueller-report-agreed-no-collusion-white-house-n1001706"" target=""_blank"">repeatedly casting doubt</a> on whether Russia interfered in 2016 despite the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/information-warfare-how-russians-interfered-2016-election-n848746"" target=""_blank"">firm assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies </a>and former<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/video/what-s-next-in-the-mueller-probe-1446044739569"" target=""_blank""> special counsel Robert Mueller</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump continues to dismiss the Mueller probe as a ""witch hunt,"" and Putin says he agrees.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/878d2344-98f0-11e9-9573-ee5cbb98ed36"" target=""_blank"">Financial Times interview</a> just ahead of the G-20, Putin brushed off ""mythical"" Russian interference and argued that Trump really won the election because he ""looked into his opponents’ attitude to him and saw changes in American society, and he took advantage of it.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">With the Mueller investigation complete, Trump and Putin are entering a new period in which the years-long probe no longer hangs over them, <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/u-s-intel-agencies-russia-china-plotting-interfere-2020-election-n963896"" target=""_blank"">although Congress continues to investigate</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Offering an outstretched hand to Trump, the Russian leader invited him next May to attend Moscow's massive annual World War II victory parade, which most global leaders have traditionally shunned. The Kremlin told Russian media that Trump has ""reacted positively to the invitation,"" although a White House official would say only that while Trump supports commemorating Allied troops who died in the war, ""he has not confirmed participation.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In recent weeks, Trump has renewed concerns about his seriousness in confronting Russia’s efforts to interfere in U.S. democracy by <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/i-think-i-d-take-it-trump-says-he-d-n1017031"" target=""_blank"">saying he would listen to damaging information</a> offered from foreign governments about one of his political opponents.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Amid the ensuing uproar, Trump shifted position and argued that he would also tell the FBI.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump's playful approach to broaching the election issue with Putin stood in sharp contrast to outgoing British Prime Minister Theresa May, who chided Putin for ""hostile interventions in other countries, disinformation and cyberattacks, which undermine Russia’s standing in the world,"" a Downing Street spokesman said. In her meeting with Putin at the G-20, May also confronted the Russian president on Moscow's actions in Ukraine, LGBT rights and what she called ""irrefutable evidence"" that Russia used a chemical weapon on British soil.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As Trump's meeting with Putin got underway, he told reporters they would be discussing trade, disarmament and “a little protectionism, perhaps.” The White House later said they had discussed Iran, Syria and Ukraine and had agreed “that improved relations between the United States and Russia was in each countries’ mutual interest and the interest of the world.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Putin, for his part, said the two leaders had much to discuss in Osaka, noting that they had not seen each other since the Helsinki summit. Still, he said through a translator that their teams had been working together in the interim and said their session in Osaka would be “a great opportunity to follow up on that.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The two sat side to side in front of Russian and American flags, flanked by their delegation. Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, along with daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and Trump’s senior adviser, Jared Kushner. Accompanying Putin were Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and other Russian officials.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A White House description of the meeting later said Trump had told Putin that “a 21st century model of arms control” must include China. It was a reference to the New START nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, set to expire in 2021, and the Trump administration’s desire that any renewal of the agreement also include China, which is not currently bound by the treaty.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meeting later in the day with the Brazilian leader, Trump told reporters he and Putin had discussed ""a lot of things"" — including Venezuela, where Russia is supporting embattled President Nicolás Maduro while the United States has recognized the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We’ll have to see what happens with Venezuela,"" Trump said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Josh Lederman is a national political reporter for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Kristen Welker is a White House correspondent for NBC News.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Hans Nichols is NBC News' Pentagon correspondent. </p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Even though she was on her family’s health insurance at the time, she said she had to pay <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/u-s-insulin-costs-patient-nearly-doubled-2012-2016-study-n961296"" target=""_blank"">hundreds of dollars every month for her insulin</a>, which was necessary for her survival.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But when the Chicago native moved to Germany, Reich said she was shocked to learn both her insulin and insulin pump were totally covered — no out-of-pocket expenses.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“As a student at a public university in Germany, I automatically qualified for the public health care system,” Reich said. “I was really surprised that everything necessary to take care of my diabetes was covered, 100 percent.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Reich said she couldn’t help feeling like a drain on the country’s system, and expressed those feelings to her German friends.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">They reassured her they simply viewed health care differently.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s about having a safety net, because tomorrow you don’t know what could happen,” Reich told NBC News.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Six years later — still living in Germany — Reich has embraced the idea of a safety net.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I don’t need to worry about crazy stuff coming up month to month. I’d rather be paying a steady fee and knowing I’m safe,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Germany has what's called a universal multi-payer health care system. It encompasses both statutory health insurance for people who earn less than a certain salary, as well as private health insurance for those who earn more and choose to purchase their own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Employers and their employees pay for most of the health care system in Germany through premiums. All workers contribute about 7.5 percent of their salary into a public health insurance pool. Employers match that 7.5 percent contribution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This “all for one and one for all” approach to health care has roots in the Middle Ages, when German craftsmen paid into one fund that was used to help any of its members in case someone became ill or suffered financial hardship.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The ideology lives on in the modern German system. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We are one big community,” said Dr. Henning Baberg, a cardiologist and the medical director of Helios Hospital Berlin-Buch. “The ones who are able to pay more, pay more. And the ones who aren’t able to pay that much, don’t pay that much.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“But they all get the same treatment,” he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg likens the difference between statutory and private health insurance in Germany to the difference between economy and business class on a commercial airline flight.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Same flight, same plane, same safety profile.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the system imposes strict limits on out-of-pocket costs, greatly reducing the number of <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/surprise-medical-bills-lead-liens-homes-crippling-debt-n984371"" target=""_blank"">surprise medical bills</a>. The maximum copay for prescription medications is about $10 or $11.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Helene and Michael Sula, both originally from Dallas, are also expatriates like Reich. Unlike Reich, however, they pay for private health insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Sulas chose to live in Germany for its central European location, and were taking advantage of the country’s proximity to the Austrian Alps when Helene tore her anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, while skiing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“When I fell, I didn’t think it was that bad,” Helene Sula, 32, recalled. “It wasn’t until a man came up to me and said, ‘We’re going to need to turn your leg back the other way’ that I realized something bad had occurred.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The couple said Helene Sula was lucky to find a doctor who could do an MRI quickly once back in Germany; most places they called were booked for weeks — a common disadvantage for elective procedures. They credited their private health insurance not only with getting a swift diagnosis, but also insisting on having the best surgeon available to do the operation necessary to repair her injured knee.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There’s a price difference, of course, but it’s your knee, so we thought we’d spend a little extra cash to get the best doctor available,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The cost for everything related to Helene Sula’s <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cool-new-knee-procedure-eases-arthritis-pain-without-surgery-n771221"" target=""_blank"">knee surgery</a> was about $2,000, compared with $14,000 for the same treatment in America.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite some language barriers, the Sulas said the German health care system was easy to navigate.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s much easier to pay your bills and understand your coverage than in America, where you’re sort of left to figure it out on your own,” Michael Sula said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Health care industry experts in the United States say the German system is a good example of an employer-based model of medical insurance.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“No one pays more than two percent of their family income for out-of-pocket health care costs” in Germany, said Robin Osborn, director of the International Health Policy and Practice Innovations program at The Commonwealth Fund.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And if you’re sick, if you’re chronically ill, it’s one percent. No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But Osborn does not recommend the U.S. copy Germany’s or any other country’s health care system and adopt it here.</p>, <p class=""content___3WSQL f7"">No one goes bankrupt in Germany because of medical care costs.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s important to remember that we do have outstanding health care in the United States. We have pockets of excellence. We have integrated delivery systems that are the envy of the world,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s just that not everyone gets that outstanding health care. It doesn’t exist uniformly across the country,” she added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Baberg, who received medical training at the University of California, San Diego, said one advantage the U.S. health care system has is transparency. Although Germans can go to any hospital they want, it’s more difficult for them to find data on quality outcomes for individual facilities.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But, he added, the U.S. health care system is flawed in a different way: Americans with less money get less health care.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“That’s wrong,” Baberg said. “That’s not humanity.

The flowering evergreens that can tower to 85 feet comprise 80 percent of the state’s canopy, covering 1 million acres, and its nectar sustains birds and insects found nowhere else on Earth.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now, public agencies and private citizens are trying to avoid biological and economic catastrophe by proclaiming war against a deadly fungal disease coined “rapid ʻōhiʻa death,” or ROD, that is swiftly destroying the trees. What’s more, invasive species like the miconia tree, native to North and South America and called the “green cancer” of Hawaii’s forests, are choking out the ʻōhiʻa.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“The disappearance of these trees would have a major impact on Hawaii,” said Clyde Imada, a botanical research specialist at the <a href=""http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/waipio/index.html"">Bishop Museum</a> of natural and cultural history in Honolulu. “Recreationally, outdoor forest experiences in natural areas will be significantly altered.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Birds, insects and plants will be direly affected,"" he continued. ""The ‘ōhi‘a forest experience can’t be re-created with substitute species.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">More than 2 million ʻōhiʻa trees have been killed by ROD, according to the U.S. Forest Service, and about <a href=""https://cms.ctahr.hawaii.edu/rod/THE-DISEASE"">135,000 acres</a> show symptoms of the disease that was first identified on the island of Hawaii, also known as the Big Island, in 2014. Two years later, the state <a href=""https://hdoa.hawaii.gov/blog/main/nr-ohiaquarantine/"">imposed a quarantine</a> to prevent ROD from spreading to other islands. It didn’t work. The <a href=""https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2018/12/22/fungus-behind-rapid-ohia-death-is-spreading-kauai/"">most aggressive form of the fungus was found on Kauai</a> late last year.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Manakō Tanaka, a Hawaiian culture expert at the Oahu Visitors Bureau, said the ʻōhiʻalehua tree and its blossoms have always been ""the first to sprout up after lava flows that wipe forests out.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“And so it’s become synonymous with the bravest of warriors who were the strongest and first into battle.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tree is also associated with Laka, the goddess of hula, its flower used in leis for the traditional Hawaiian dance. <a href=""https://www.staradvertiser.com/2016/03/31/hawaii-news/ohia-lehua-blight-takes-toll-on-hula-competition/"">In 2016, for the first time in more than 50 years, </a>many hula schools were forced to forgo their adornments because of diminishing ʻōhiʻa stock.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It would be heartbreaking to only be able to show pictures of the tree and its flowers to future generations,” Tanaka said. “Losing the ʻōhiʻa lehua would be like losing a reference encyclopedia into the past.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Experts believe the fungus may have been carried to the islands by unwitting tourists, perhaps on their shoes or hiking boots. It can also be transmitted by dirty tools, woodland animals or the wind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is speculation visitors are responsible for bringing this disease to Hawaii Island,” said Sam Gon, senior scientist at The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. “Either because they were uninformed or uncaring about the need to sanitize their gear. ROD could have a devastating effect on our environment and economy, and we need to reform tourism practices among visitors.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The federal government has attempted to stop the fungus and tackle invasive species by imposing a quarantine on Hawaii Island and carrying out extensive tests to learn how the fungus spreads, but it has yet to find a solution. Hawaiian organizations, communities and scientists are now stepping in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Gunstock Ranch, a horse riding stable and tourist destination on Oahu, is replanting native trees, although not the ʻōhi‘a yet. After conducting a survey on 80 acres of its land in 2016, and finding just two native species, owner Greg Smith established a Hawaiian <a href=""https://gunstockranch.com/hawaiian-legacy-forest/"">“legacy forest,”</a> where visitors can plant trees and monitor their growth online.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Our hope is that as our guests plant and dedicate a tree they will form a new connection to the land and Hawaii and leave knowing that they made a difference,” Smith said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some tourism companies are sending staff members to workshops to learn how to protect native species through improved biological sanitation practices. Joshua Nipp, founder of <a href=""https://www.offthebeatenpath.com/"">Off the Beaten Path</a> travel company, hopes to establish a bio-sanitation certification program for tour operators.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A coalition of state agencies called the <a href=""https://www.cgaps.org/why-should-we-care/"">Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species</a> is pushing for stronger regulations and tracking of biological products entering Hawaii.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tanaka said tourists can play an important role in staving off ROD, particularly on islands like Oahu, which has not yet been infected with the fungus. He said they should always make sure their shoes are clean and free of debris and seeds, and he urged visitors to stay away from areas marked off-limits to protect delicate ecosystems.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“There is a proverb in Hawaiian, ‘I aliʻi ka ‘āina, i kauā ke kanaka.’ It means, ‘The land is chief, and men are its stewards,’” Tanaka said. “Sometimes, though, I fear that we may be moving to a world where people think it is the other way around.”</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Lucy Sherriff is a freelance journalist based in Los Angeles.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

Complaints and protests from artists and arts organizations in real life and on social media, including at least <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275114/facebook-community-guidelines-nipples-nudity"">one that went viral</a>, made little progress.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I started to decide that it just comes with the territory,” Spirit said of Facebook’s bans.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But arts organizations kept at it. In early June, 125 people protested in the nude outside the New York City headquarters of Facebook and Instagram, covering themselves with stickers of photographed male nipples in protest of the long-argued double standard that only female nipples are against the company’s policies.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The artists’ action speaks to just how important the platforms, especially Instagram, have become to the arts now that Tumblr — once a haven for artists — <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/tumblr-ban-all-adult-content-n943226"">does not allow any adult content</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Instagram has been so important for artists, especially those who don’t necessarily have a regular venue for their work,” said Svetlana Mintcheva, director of programs at the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), an alliance of more than 50 nonprofits. “But they develop huge audiences on Instagram, and photographic artists more so than others.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The pressure campaign worked. Facebook said it would organize a group of artists, educators and activists to talk about its policies. It’s a move that is mirrored in the social network’s broader re-evaluation of its content policies as well as its move to find people outside its corporate borders to help rewrite its rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s a start, but the arts community is not declaring victory just yet.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We don’t just want to talk,” Svetlana said. “We’d like to see some action, too.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ruchika Budhraja, a spokesperson for Facebook, said the company was committed to meeting with artists, the NCAC and other stakeholders. “It’s important for us to hear directly from different communities who use Facebook and Instagram,” she said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook’s challenges over where to draw the line with nudity in some ways pre-date the now-prominent debate over its role in spreading misinformation and hate speech, underscoring how the company’s rules have shifted drastically, often in one direction and then the other, during its meteoric rise.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Facebook banned pornography early on, its efforts to restrict nudity extended to <a href=""https://www.mic.com/articles/90795/how-women-got-facebook-to-tackle-their-nipple-problem"">pictures of breastfeeding</a>, a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/01/facebook-nude-painting-gustave-courbet"">famous French painting</a> of a nude woman and even <a href=""https://gizmodo.com/these-nipples-got-the-new-yorker-banned-from-facebook-5942284"">a New Yorker cartoon</a>. Though the stakes were lower than years later when the company needed to confront issues like fake news and coordinated foreign manipulation campaigns, many activists took the issue no less seriously.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The tenacity of the artist community, even years ago, points to just how central both Facebook and Instagram have become to the daily lives of billions of people as well as to the cultures they participate in. And since Facebook would often delete entire accounts along with their work, artists could spend years building up followings only to see them disappear.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It takes years to build up a base of followers, so this is no small deal for artists working with the body,” said Spencer Tunick, an artist <a href=""https://slate.com/culture/2008/01/why-doesn-t-spencer-tunick-get-any-respect.html"">known for his use of nudity</a> — particularly groups of naked people — who helped organize the protest in June. “It’s a major issue as we see it now.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Tunick credited artist Micol Hebron with being the first person to <a href=""https://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/1088838/women-are-putting-male-nipples-over-their-own-to-call-out-censorship-hypocrisy/"">digitize the male nipple</a> in 2014 and encourage the public to use it to fight censorship on social media. He stressed that he understands why Facebook needs to draw lines, but that there are ways for the company to embrace experimental art while protecting younger users.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Facebook has shown some flexibility. Gabriella Mas Bell, a lawyer with the law firm Polsinelli who has <a href=""https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol54/iss1/24/"">written about Facebook’s censorship</a> of artistic nudity, said that she would have to constantly update her work because the company’s terms of service frequently changed.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I was having to go back and change the language in my article, so you could tell that they were really trying to address it,” Bell said. “So I’m not actually that surprised they’re trying to find a better solution as they’re cracking down on things like hate speech and the abusive language.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For now, however, artists still have to be careful. Spirit said she recently had four pictures deleted from Instagram and knows other artists who were recently banned from the platform for 24 hours for posting some of Tunick’s images.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But she said she’s hopeful that Facebook could finally make changes. All it took was a few dozen nude people outside one of their offices.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“We got their attention,” she said.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Jason Abbruzzese is the senior editor for technology news at NBC News Digital.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

""We need to make sure kids go to community schools which are integrated, and that means we have to focus on fair housing legislation and enforcement.

One of the biggest problems with the program — as Sanders noted — was that African-American children were being bused at great lengths to attend white schools. The recent school integration debate focuses more heavily on the battle between public and charter schools and on efforts to desegregate communities as a whole.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The busing issue — which Biden figured prominently in as a senator in the 1970s — came to the forefront after Harris pushed him Thursday to address his position. In that exchange, Harris said Biden worked with segregationist senators ""to oppose busing,"" adding that a local busing program allowed her to attend an integrated school and obtain a good education.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden pushed back, saying she mischaracterized his position ""across the board"" and highlighted his broad support of civil rights.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I did not oppose busing in America,"" Biden said. ""What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That’s what I opposed.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">To many, Biden's explanation sounded a lot like the ""states rights"" defense that opponents to civil rights enforcement have cited for decades.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sen.

The forum's executive director, Chuck Wexler, said an important takeaway was that police departments and other law enforcement agencies must do a better job of capturing and analyzing police suicide data because ""the research is really uneven.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We advocated that agencies should conduct psychological autopsies on suicides and learn what were the circumstances that resulted in these tragedies,"" Wexler said Friday.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""We don't even know how many people have attempted suicide,"" he added.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The danger is amplified for officers who are battling depression and mental health issues because they have easier access to weapons, Wexler said. For some officers, he added, the idea of coming forward about their mental health — then having their firearms confiscated for safety — can only make them less likely to speak up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""There's no question that what makes police officers at-risk is because they have an occupational need to have a firearm, and in many of these cases, firearms are the way officers take their lives,"" Wexler said. ""You've got a combustible mixture when you have someone who's dealing with some significant personal issues and the availability of a firearm.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sean Powers, a 12-year veteran of the NYPD who retired in 2005, said the fear for some officers is not only that their guns could be taken away, but they would be placed on desk assignment or left monitoring surveillance cameras instead of being out on the beat.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""You lose your identity,"" he said.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Powers, 56, became a volunteer with POPPA, the peer-assistance program, with the desire to help his fellow officers, many struggling with trauma from 9/11. Not long after joining POPPA, he said, he got a call from an officer who was threatening to shoot himself in a quiet parking lot outside of a church on Staten Island. In that case, the officer was helped before he could do any physical harm.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While the NYPD and the city of New York provides <a href=""https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/careers/human-resources-info/employee-assistance-unit.page"" target=""_blank"">internal resources to officers</a>, POPPA offers anonymous counseling services outside of the department.

This supermarket staple is simple to cook and can be prepped in such a wide variety of ways, that it’s probably always on your weekly shopping list. You just know you’re going to use it and even if you don’t, chicken can easily be frozen for future meals. In fact, do your budget a favor and pick up a value pack of breasts to freeze in individual or family-size portions, so you always have a wallet-friendly dinner at the ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No doubt you have a <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/easy-delicious-chicken-dinners-make-every-night-next-week-ncna900946"" target=""_blank"">few favorite chicken recipes</a> in your back pocket, but considering the ease, affordability and versatility of boneless breasts, why not mix up your repertoire with a few fresh ideas? Here, chefs and food experts, including Giada De Laurentiis, Andrew Zimmern, Urvashi Pitre, Cassy Joy Garcia, Serena Wolf, Nik Sharma, Marge Perry and David Bonom share the chicken dishes they make over and over again. Their recipes show just how much you can do with simple chicken breasts, including <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/pop-culture/10-healthy-recipes-your-memorial-day-barbecue-ncna763546"" target=""_blank"">grilling</a>, roasting and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/diy-chinese-takeout-recipe-sesame-chicken-cauliflower-fried-rice-ncna1005141"" target=""_blank"">stir-frying</a>, plus how well this lean protein takes to different flavors. So, stock your fridge and freezer and get ready for some serious kitchen inspiration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“This dish is easy to throw together on a weeknight with everything I always have in my kitchen: boneless, skinless chicken breasts, fennel, onion and canned tomatoes,” says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur <a href=""https://giadzy.com/"" target=""_blank"">Giada De Laurentiis</a>. It’s a lighter — not to mention speedier — take on an Italian classic. “The breadcrumbs are still there for crunch, but by sprinkling them on top, the prep is even easier and cleaner,” explains De Laurentiis.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For another weeknight-friendly chicken dish, De Laurentiis looks to Tuscany. “These chicken breasts are simple yet delicious.” Plus, most of the supporting ingredients are ones you likely have on hand and the recipe takes just 30 minutes from start to finish. Serving the chicken breasts over spinach “adds balance and makes them a complete meal,” notes De Laurentiis. And if you have fresh spinach, feel free to use it in place of the frozen.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This quick, deconstructed salad, from Marge Perry and David Bonom’s cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Hero-Dinners-Complete-One-Pan-Meals/dp/0062856065/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=hero+dinners&amp;qid=1554233181&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1"" target=""_blank"">Hero Dinners: Complete One-Pan Meals That Save the Day</a>"" puts a new spin on a guaranteed crowd-pleaser. “Roasting boneless, skinless breasts to temperature results in juicy, tender chicken — and couldn’t be simpler!” insists Perry. “The key is using an instant-read thermometer and cooking the chicken until it is safe but not overcooked and dry: 160°F.” It’s also essential to let the chicken rest. “If you were to slice the chicken right away, the juices would pour out onto the cutting board, which would result in drier, less tender chicken,” explains Perry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Seasoning chicken breasts with a marinade gives them “a whole new life,” says Nik Sharma, the blogger behind <a href=""http://www.abrowntable.com/"" target=""_blank"">A Brown Table</a> and author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Season-Big-Flavors-Beautiful-Food/dp/1452163995/"" target=""_blank"">Season: Big Flavors, Beautiful Food</a>"". Sharma combines buttermilk, lime juice, serrano chiles, scallions, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, cayenne, coriander, cardamom and cumin and recommends marinating for at least four hours and up to eight. His recipe is “a playful take on fried chicken with a big boost of flavors and a great way to introduce curry leaves to folks that are new to it.” If you’re nervous about frying, don’t be. It’s a lot easier to fry small chunks of chicken than whole, bone-in pieces and Sharma has two handy tips: Cut the chicken into equal size pieces so it cooks evenly and watch the temperature of the oil. Otherwise, there’s nothing to it.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This speedy supper, from <a href=""https://andrewzimmern.com/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Zimmern</a>, the James Beard Award-winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""<a href=""https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/bizarre-foods"" target=""_blank"">Bizarre Foods</a>"", pairs grilled chicken with Panzanella, a traditional Italian bread salad. Zimmern seasons boneless, skinless chicken breasts with garlic, parsley and chives and then gently pounds them, so they can be quickly charred over high heat and will “look beautiful on the plate.” Pounding also makes them tender enough for “fork only” eating. Zimmern’s Panzanella features tomato, basil, fennel, and grapefruit, but he encourages you to improvise with what looks good at the farmers’ market.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I love the unique flavors of this dish and that it’s so easy to pull together,” says Cassy Joy Garcia, the blogger behind <a href=""https://fedandfit.com/"" target=""_blank"">Fed + Fit</a> and author of the cookbook, ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1628603437"" target=""_blank"">Cook Once, Eat All Week: 26 Weeks of Gluten-Free, Affordable Meal Prep to Preserve Your Time &amp; Sanity</a>"". Boneless, skinless breasts are generously seasoned with a blend of ginger, cumin, garlic, paprika and turmeric then seared in a hot pan. Next, rice is cooked in the same pan, so it picks up all that great Moroccan-inspired flair. Green olives, lemon wedges and chopped fresh cilantro add a little color and brightness to the final dish.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Chicken is really easy to work with,” insists Garcia, who pairs boneless breasts with homemade roasted garlic pesto and prosciutto. “The pesto and prosciutto offer wonderful flavor, bringing chicken from standard to really exciting,” says Garcia. Plus, “it’s an easy protein to prepare in advance, so you can enjoy it for several meals throughout the week.” Garcia recommends pairing the chicken with simple roasted potatoes and a green salad for a complete feast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Boneless, skinless chicken breasts get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless, but that's because most people overcook and under season the protein, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind <a href=""https://domesticate-me.com/"" target=""_blank"">Domesticate Me</a> and author of the upcoming ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Dude-Diet-Dinnertime-Weeknight-Fancypants/dp/0062854704/"" target=""_blank"">The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners</a>"". But, if you season the meat well — even just with salt and pepper —and stick to the suggested cooking time, this lean protein can’t be beat. Sliced or diced breast meat is particularly good in stir-fries, because it cooks quickly and absorbs flavor so well, explains Wolf. To guarantee the chicken stays juicy, Wolf cooks it on its own then adds it back to the pan after the other ingredients are ready.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For her couldn’t-be-simpler Indian Chicken Tikka Bites, Urvashi Pitre, the blogger behind <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Two Sleevers </a>and the author of ""<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Keto-Fat-Bombs-Sweets-Treats/dp/0358074304"" target=""_blank"">Keto Fat Bombs, Sweet &amp; Treats: Over 100 Recipes and Ideas for Low-Carb Breads, Cakes, Cookies and More</a>"", uses a marinade of yogurt, garlic, ginger and spices to tenderize and flavor the meat. “You can cook the chicken quickly, but still have a tender little mouthful of spicy goodness,” says Pitre. Her other trick is to cook the chicken in ghee, which is clarified butter. It has a higher smoke point than regular butter, so you can use high heat to sear the chicken. Ghee can be purchased at many supermarkets, or you can make your own in less than 20 minutes with Pitre’s <a href=""https://twosleevers.com/homemade-ghee/"" target=""_blank"">easy recipe</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/12-french-fry-recipes-won-t-kill-you-ncna771896"">Want more tips like these?

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads with followers by a landslide — 17.7 million for him, versus 7.7 million for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 4.4 million for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, 3.6 million for former Vice President Joe Biden and 3.4 million for California Sen. Kamala Harris. (Several candidates have multiple Twitter accounts, so Socially Mined combined their accounts in this analysis.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Going by “engagement rate” on Twitter, a measure that looks at “likes” and “retweets” on the platform, the leader is Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, followed by Harris, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Warren and Biden.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And looking at “mentions” on the platform, again it’s Sanders with a big lead, with more than 4.1 million mentions, compared to 3.5 million for Biden, 3.3 million for Warren, 2.7 million for Harris and 996,000 for Buttigieg.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That's a set of numbers that shows a Democratic Party in the mood for change and perhaps ready to move to the left philosophically. Bernie Sanders leads in two categories. Joe Biden leads in none. And Elizabeth Warren is ahead of Biden in two of the three.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When you look at “sentiment” among Twitter users in the Socially Mined data, the trend becomes even clearer. Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Buttigieg, Warren, Booker, Sanders and Harris all had a higher percentage of “positive” tweets than Biden in June.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rivals-defend-kamala-harris-against-online-attacks-they-compare-birtherism-n1025031"" target=""_blank"">before you let Twitter sort</a> out the Democratic field completely, consider the latest polls of the enormous Democratic field. Most show Biden with a solid lead over his nearest competitor, and some of the margins are well into the double-digit range.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Biden leads the field by 15 points in the latest USA Today/Suffolk poll. He’s up by 19 in the Politico/Morning Consult poll. And in the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Biden leads by 15 points over the field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Yes, those numbers were gathered before this week’s debate, where Harris, in particular, had a good showing and Biden did not. But the social media data above was gathered mostly before the debates as well, from June 1 to June 28.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In other words, this is close to an apples-to-apples comparison in terms of the time frame. Nonetheless, the poll numbers don't match up particularly well with the figures from the 280-character ""debate"" appearing on people's smartphone and web browsers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll offered more evidence that Democratic primary voters are more politically moderate than Twitter might suggest. That survey took a deeper look at those who said they planned to vote in the Democratic primary and it did not find an electorate that was running to the left.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That is a split right down the middle between liberal and moderate/conservative voters, 48 percent for each group.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The NBC News/WSJ poll also doesn't seem to reveal the desire for a drastic remaking of the country. Only 16 percent of those surveyed said Democracy in America needs a complete overhaul. Another 41 percent called for major changes and 32 percent said minor changes would suffice. Meanwhile, 10 percent said it was working pretty well as is.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Those are numbers that call for change, hardly a surprise for the party that is out of power in Washington and eager to change the occupant of the White House, but not revolution.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It's still early, of course. Things can change quickly, particularly as the debates continue and when the votes begin to be cast. But so far there are two Democratic primary races going on in the public eye: A battle that is primarily taking place on the left in the social media world, and a more moderate view in the larger, offline world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As the primary fight continues to keep those two visions of the Democratic electorate in mind.

There have also been <a href=""https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.109.924977"">studies</a> linking processed meats to a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes. “The current evidence suggests the higher intake of processed meat, the higher the risk of chronic diseases and mortality,” says <a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/faculty/frank-hu/"">Frank B. Hu</a>, MD, PhD, Professor and Chair, Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Hu notes that while there is no sufficient evidence to suggest a safe amount, eating a small amount of processed meat occasionally (once or twice a month) is unlikely to have an appreciable health impact.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now that we know that the <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-better-choice-hot-dog-or-hamburger-ncna864021"" target=""_blank"">occasional hot dog</a> or strip of bacon isn’t cause for concern, what about a more routine processed meat habit? And what about deli turkey? Is that off the hook? How about meats that claim to have no added nitrates? Those can’t be that bad, can they? To answer these pressing questions, we turned to <a href=""mailto:http://pressroom.cancer.org/colleendoyle"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click to send email to Colleen Doyle"">Colleen Doyle</a>, MS, RD, Managing Director, Nutrition and Physical Activity at the American Cancer Society.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Processed meat is a meat that has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it through salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, says Doyle. Think: bacon, sausages, hot dogs, canned meat and other cured meats like salami. And that includes deli meat — whether red (like roast beef or ham) or white (like turkey or chicken).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Unfortunately, we just don’t know. “Many studies don’t differentiate between red and white meat consumption in the subjects, so there are still unanswered questions,” Doyle explains.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">When it comes to processed meats, consumers are often concerned with added, synthetic nitrates, which are used to preserve the meats and keep them fresher, longer. If you’re concerned about additives, these more natural-sounding meats might seem appealing. But there’s a catch. Doyle explains that these natural meats (including chicken and turkey) are still processed, and they’re still made with nitrates. “They use natural sources of preservatives,” she says. “Many companies are using celery powder, celery juice or celery salt, which are high in nitrates. They can still label their product ‘nitrate-free’, because those are natural and not synthetic, but they are nitrates nonetheless.” In other words, once you ingest deli turkey or chicken or ham made with celery powder or another natural preservative, you’re still consuming nitrates — it’s just in a different form. “Unfortunately, we just don’t know yet whether these have the same impact as synthetic sources of nitrates.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I’ve got a lot of bacon-loving friends who ask me this all the time!” says Doyle. Unfortunately, this is another big question mark. “It isn’t known whether there is a safe level of consumption for processed meat — or for unprocessed red meat,” she says. (Unprocessed red meat, like hamburger and steak, has also been linked to health problems.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle understands the popularity of these snacks as they’re approved for many trendy eating patterns (like <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/best-weight-loss-advice-borrow-popular-diets-ncna926246"">paleo</a> and <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""mailto:https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/what-keto-diet-it-right-you-ncna847256"">keto</a>), and they’re a portable option for people on the go. However, make no mistake. “They’re still processed meats (and tend to be high sodium), so I’d still advise people limit them,” she says. According to Hu, regular consumption of these foods is not considered a healthy dietary choice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Doyle says that while she hasn’t seen studies specifically calling out smoked salmon, it definitely meets the definition of processed. “And, it’s pretty high in sodium. Bottom line for this and all processed meats: It would be smart to eat fish, poultry and beans over red (unprocessed) meat, and for individuals who do consume processed meat products, to do so sparingly, if at all.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If your mind is spinning with this info and your regular lunch routine or <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/healthy-travel-snacks-ncna1021666"" target=""_blank"">on-the-go snack</a> now feels a little less healthy, here are some ideas for replacing processed meats with whole foods.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Want more tips like these?

93,Scientists are searching for a mirror universe. It could be sitting right in front of you.,27,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/scientists-are-searching-mirror-universe-it-could-be-sitting-right-ncna1023206,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,17,12,science,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in eastern Tennessee, physicist Leah Broussard is trying to open a portal to a parallel universe.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She calls it an “oscillation” that would lead her to “mirror matter,” but the idea is fundamentally the same. In a series of experiments she plans to run at Oak Ridge this summer, Broussard will <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00767"" target=""_blank"">send a beam of subatomic particles down a 50-foot tunnel</a>, past a ring of powerful magnets and into an impenetrable wall. If the setup is just right — and if the universe cooperates — some of those particles will transform into mirror-image versions of themselves, allowing them to tunnel right through the wall. And if that happens, Broussard will have uncovered the first evidence of a mirror world right alongside our own.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“It’s pretty wacky,” Broussard says of her mind-bending exploration.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The mirror world, assuming it exists, would have its own laws of mirror-physics and its own mirror-history. You wouldn’t find a mirror version of yourself there (and no evil Mister Spock with a goatee — sorry ""Star Trek"" fans). But current theory allows that you might find mirror atoms and mirror rocks, maybe even mirror planets and stars. Collectively, they could form an entire shadow world, just as real as our own but almost completely cut off from us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard says her initial search for the mirror world won’t be especially difficult. “This is a pretty straightforward experiment that we cobbled together with parts we found lying around, using equipment and resources we already had available at Oak Ridge,” she says. But if she unequivocally detects even a single mirror particle, it would prove that the visible universe is only half of what is out there — and that the known laws of physics are only half of a much broader set of rules.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“If you discover something new like that, the game totally changes,” Broussard says.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">As with many grand scientific quests, the hunt for mirror matter <a href=""https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/"" target=""_blank"">grew out of a small, seemingly esoteric mystery</a>. Starting in the 1990s, physicists developed high-precision experiments to study how neutrons — particles found in the nuclei of atoms — break down into protons, a process related to radioactivity. But those experiments took a strange turn.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Researchers found that neutrons created in particle beams, similar to the one Broussard will use, last 14 minutes and 48 seconds, on average, before “decaying” into protons. But neutrons stored in a laboratory bottle seem to break down a bit faster, in 14 minutes and 38 seconds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Ten seconds might not sound like much, but the actual difference should be zero: All neutrons are exactly the same, and their behavior should depend not one bit on where or how they are examined.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I take discrepancy very seriously,” says Benjamin Grinstein, a particle-physics expert at the University of California, San Diego. “It’s not just between two experiments. It is a collection of many experiments done independently by several groups. The newest experiments, conceived in part to resolve the disagreement, <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6389/627"" target=""_blank"">have “only made it worse,”</a> he adds.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Grinstein has explored the possibility that some neutrons are unexpectedly breaking down into particles other than protons but has found nothing so far. Mirror matter offers a more elegant, if somewhat bizarre, explanation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A decade ago, Anatoli Serebrov of Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Russia introduced the idea that ordinary neutrons sometimes cross over into the mirror world and transform into mirror neutrons. At that point, we could no longer detect them — it would be as if some of the neutrons simply vanished. “That would make the neutron lifetime look wrong,” Broussard explains, because some of the neutrons would have been disappearing from the test equipment while the researchers were studying them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Connect the dots, and you reach a far-out conclusion: The neutron experiments might look screwy because physicists unwittingly opened a portal to the mirror world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Broussard’s goal is to find out if that portal really exists and, if so, to open it in a methodical way. That’s where her neutron beam and impenetrable wall come in.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Oak Ridge has an 85-megawatt <a href=""https://neutrons.ornl.gov/hfir"">nuclear reactor</a> that can shoot out billions of neutrons on demand, so getting enough raw material to work with isn’t an issue. The hard part is figuring out how to make some of the neutrons cross over into the mirror world, and then prove to her skeptical colleagues (and to her skeptical self) that it really happened.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Running the experiment will take about one day. Collecting the data and weeding out every possible source of error might then take a few weeks more. Broussard is looking for any telltale neutrons that managed to get past the barrier by turning into mirror neutrons, then turning back. “It all comes down to: Are we able to shine neutrons through a wall?” she says. “We should see no neutrons” according to conventional physics theory. If some of them show up anyway, that would suggest that conventional physics is wrong, and the mirror world is real.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Meanwhile, Klaus Kirch is working on a complementary experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Zurich. His plan is to capture slow-moving neutrons, hit them with a magnetic field and then count to see if all the particles are still there. “If some neutrons oscillated into mirror-neutrons, they would disappear from our apparatus,” he says. Kirch's team has already run the experiment and hopes to have their results analyzed later in the summer.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Despite their conceptual simplicity, both Broussard’s and Kirch’s experiments are extremely delicate undertakings, dependent on assessing the strange behavior of a few subatomic particles within a crowd of billions. Other researchers have proposed that there might be more blatant signs of a mirror world. We might be seeing it everywhere in the sky.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Since the 1970s, astronomers have deduced that the universe is packed full of “<a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-dark-matter-ncna871991"">dark matter</a>,” a substance that cannot be observed directly but whose powerful gravitational pull helps keep galaxies from flying apart. The latest analyses indicate that dark matter outweighs visible matter by a factor of five. Yet dozens of intensive searches by astronomers around the world have failed to identify what dark matter is made of.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Zurab Berezhiani, a physicist at the University of L’Aquila in Italy who has conducted his own <a href=""https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-018-6189-y"">mirror neutron searches</a>, offers an intriguing explanation: Dark matter has been hard to find because it is hidden away in the mirror world. In this view, dark matter and mirror matter are one and the same. If so, the mirror world is not just ubiquitous, it is far more massive than our own. At a recent physics conference, Berezhiani <a href=""http://www.int.washington.edu/PROGRAMS/17-69W/"">expanded on the idea</a>, outlining a possible parallel reality full of mirror stars, mirror galaxies and mirror black holes. Maybe even dark life?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“Dark people is probably a bit farfetched,” says Broussard, who confesses that these ideas push her right to the edge of her comfort zone. “But dark matter is very likely as rich as our own matter. This kind of thing needs to be explored.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If she can open a passage to the mirror world at Oak Ridge, that will be one heck of a start.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">SIGN UP FOR THE <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://link.nbcnews.com/join/5cj/mach-signup"">MACH NEWSLETTER</a> AND FOLLOW NBC NEWS MACH ON <a href=""https://twitter.com/NBCNewsMACH"">TWITTER</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NBCNewsMACH/"">FACEBOOK</a>, AND <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/NBCNewsMach/"">INSTAGRAM</a>.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"

I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.” In July of 2013, Alicia Garza wrote these words in reaction to a jury’s acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. That post turned into a hashtag which became the rallying cry for one of the most recognizable social movements of this generation. </em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled""><em>While it can feel like the nation’s current racial discourse is trending downward, the last four or five years have seen an ostensible, rapid expansion of social justice consciousness with public opinion polling showing racial attitudes moving in the right direction. Black Lives Matter was an enormous part of catalyzing these public opinion changes and reform movements. Alicia Garza is at the center of it all and joins us to shed light on the origins of #BlackLivesMatter and how it’s evolved in the years since.</em></p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: One of the things that we are really trying to get across is that black people are not a monolith. We are LGBT, we are urban and rural, we are liberal and conservative and the candidate and the campaign that is going to energize us the most is going to act like they know something about us and it's going to go beyond fried chicken and hot sauce.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Hello and welcome to ""Why Is This Happening?"" with me, your host Chris Hayes. So there's this term that I started seeing online that people have been writing about the era we're in and it's a tongue-in-cheek term that I think is basically sort of derisive, but kind of in a comical way and it's the “Great Awokening.” You've maybe heard this term, the Great Awokening. And it's a reference to the great awakening, which were at least two different periods of incredible religious fervor that spread through the United States in both the 18th and 19th centuries and you know, really shaped a lot about American spirituality, religion and politics.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It led to the creation of different Christian traditions and new religions and it changed public opinion. It also, you know, provided the seeds for what would become the abolition movement, right? So this real transformation in people's consciousness, the way they thought about their relationship to each other and to God and then that became a social force that ended up in abolition.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The Great Awokening, which is again, a kind of tongue-in-cheek term, is about a sort of social justice consciousness explosion that's happened in this country I would say in the last four or five years, and I think particularly among a certain segment or sector of white people. And that's why I think the kind of Awokening teasingness is embedded in that term, right? That certain kind of person, a white person who is sort of finding a kind of racial consciousness about the nature of white supremacy, the nature of racial hierarchy, the nature of racial exclusion for people of color, the history of the country in that respect.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But I actually, I am kind of a defender of the Great Awokening. I think that one of the crazy paradoxes of our time is that there are two things happening simultaneously, and it's really hard to kind of keep them both in your head. There is a white ethno-nationalist backlash in the country's politics. There is increasingly loud out and proud avowed white supremacists, Nazis, people in the public sphere advocating for blood and soil ethno-nationalism.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There is a president in the White House who is an obvious bigot and racist and says racist and bigoted things and doesn't back down from saying racist and bigoted things and has given permission to other politicians and to other ones of his followers to be outwardly bigoted and racist about black people, about Muslims, about all sorts of different groups.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And at some level, it feels like it's as worse as it's ever been in terms of the country's racial discourse. Well, that's obviously not true. It's as worse as it's been in my lifetime or my adult lifetime in terms of the country's racial discourse and the presence of outwardly white supremacist bigoted ideas about what America should be, that it should be essentially a white man's republic which is lurking all around the Trump administration everywhere you look, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The positions they take, the fact they're trying to rig the census explicitly to help white people get more power. The way they talk about immigrants and not just unauthorized immigrants, but legal immigrants, too. The kind of demographic dilution, the idea that there's this great replacement happening which is this really vile white nationalist idea that behind the curtain, Jews like George Soros are paying people to flood the country with non-white folks so that white people won't make a majority. All this stuff is really dangerous, vile, disgusting and right out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You can turn on Trump TV and you can hear this kind of stuff. So that's one part of our racial discourse. The other part of our racial discourse is that racial attitudes in public opinion data after public opinion data are getting much better. People are more pro-immigrant now than they have been at any time in recent memory, partly, I think, as response in backlash to what Trump and Trumpism means. Appreciations and perceptions of the challenges that African Americans face, particularly because of structural racism and white supremacy by white people is getting much, much better.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Now if you dig into the data, there are huge, huge differences internally like education level and generationally, right? Young white folks with college degrees are much more likely to answer affirmatively that there are structural impediments to black advancement that are the product of white supremacy and structural racism than say a 65-year-old white person with a high school degree.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All that said, the public opinion is moving in the right direction and also, the politics of a lot of the issues on the ground around race are moving in the right direction. You see these victories. You see a city like Philadelphia elect a public defender to be the chief prosecutor, running explicitly on an agenda of completely overhauling the way we conceive of our prosecutors office, Larry Krasner, who we had on the podcast.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You see in Florida almost a two-thirds majority voting to give felons who have completed their sentence the right to vote. You see reform candidates all over the place across the country winning election on ending cash bail. All of this is stuff that the politics of which has always been intensely racially coded and in the years of the '80s and '90s particularly was used as a kind of form to demagogue on race, right? We're going to throw people in jail and lock away the key. And I lived it firsthand in New York City and I wrote a book about that experience called A Colony in A Nation.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And in many, many ways, public opinion and the politics of those issues are better now, much improved. So that’s the paradox of the moment about America's racial politics this moment. We're super polarized. The most vile kinds of thoughts about racial essentialism and racism and white supremacy are more available than they've ever been and in some ways more empowered than they've ever been. And at the same time, public opinion is moving in the right direction and there are all these local victories.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And it's hard to make sense of how this is the case, but I think you can't tell the story of where we are without talking about the movement for black lives and Black Lives Matter. Because Black Lives Matter beginning in 2013, which was the trial of George Zimmerman for killing teenager and Florida native Trayvon Martin. That phrase and the movement that built up around it, about the deaths of black people at the hands of either white assailants or police officers or the State in some way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">That movement was an enormous part of catalyzing the public opinion changes we've seen, an enormous part of catalyzing the reform movements we've seen. And yet the movement itself feels way less present in the everyday of Trump's America than it did five years ago. The amount of cable news stories about a black man dead at the hands of police is much lower. The amount of demonstrations you see in the wake of that, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There was a period of time in which that was so dominant in the news and in consciousness and the dominance of that in the news and the consciousness has gone away, but also, in the wake of it has transformed into really profound and I think amazing changes in American racial attitudes.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I wanted to talk to someone who's been at the center of this trajectory about where we are right now. Her name is Alicia Garza. She is the co-creator of Black Lives Matter Global Network. She is a principal of this really cool organization called Black Futures Lab, which is a kind of think tank that's trying to think about different ways of imagining the future for black people in America. And she's the director of strategy and partnerships of the National Domestic Worker's Alliance. And you have probably read about her or seen her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She is just incredibly compelling and dynamic force. If you ever see her speak, you will remember. You will write down her name. You will remember her. You will remember the way that she talks. She was the person that wrote the phrase Black Lives Matter in this impassioned Facebook post in the wake of the acquittal of George Zimmerman for Trayvon Martin's death. She's an organizer and an activist. And you'll hear in this conversation she's got incredible wisdom and first-hand experience in how you build movements and sustain movements for social justice.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And she also has a feature ... I was talking to Tiffany about this. She has something that I'm finding more and more is a kind of a common thread in a lot of people we interview here on #WITHpod and that I find interesting which is that we like to think of American life as very fluid and mobile, that people can begin at any station, rise very high and we don't have these huge barriers. But the reality of it is it's often not that way. It's often like the deck of the Titanic.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">People are consigned to different parts of an experience. And something that Alicia has is life experience in many different worlds of American life and experience of being a person who was the other, who was different than the world that she was living in, which you'll hear her talking about. And I think that imbues her, and it imbues a lot of the other people that we talked to on the podcast with this kind of perspective. This almost sort of form of moral prophecy that comes from experiencing yourself in relation to others in this very sort of distinct way.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so you can hear her talk about how she found her way through her upbringing, through her life experience to the work that she's done and crucially, where we are right now in this moment. How do you think about the paradox between Donald Trump and the White House, white nationalism and ethno-nationalism on the march globally and the movement for black equality and true, genuine, egalitarian multiracial democracy in the 21st century.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">You've been on my radar screen for years now and I just thought maybe I'd talk a little bit about your upbringing. You're from the Bay Area, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Born and raised.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Born and raised. What was your upbringing like and where did you sort of start to get your political consciousness?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: You know, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, lived in San Rafael, California, represent, and then moved to Tiburon and people always at this point go, ""Oh, Tiburon."" This very swanky place. And yes, I was one of the only black people who lived there for anybody who's asking. I grew up the product ... My mom, she was incredible. She passed away a year ago.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I’m sorry.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's okay. Thank you. She was kind of a jack of all trades and could do everything and anything. But I wouldn't say that my mom or my parents were political at all. I mean in some ways, they lived kind of a political life. They were an interracial couple and so I think you get to avoid politics when you're, you know, challenging them by your very existence.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Totally.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: But I wouldn't say that they were necessarily political.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: They were not activists. They were not ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It was not dinner table fights on the news.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not at all. Not at all. They weren't encouraging me to go to marches and things like that, you know. I'm not a red diaper baby. I actually got politicized at the age of 12. There was a fight happening in my school district about whether or not to offer contraception in school nurses' offices. And my mom, you know, had me as a single mother. And she didn't expect to have me and so she had to figure it out. And from a very, very young age, she talked to me about sex and the real story. She wasn't there's a stork and you know, I didn't get any of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It was sex makes babies, babies are expensive and that's the end of the story. So when it came to being able to provide tools for people to be able to determine what they wanted their life to look like, when and if they wanted to start and have families, it seemed like a no-brainer for me, but it was certainly a big deal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So was the fight about the accessibility or the availability of contraceptives in the school?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yes. Absolutely. And, of course, this was during the Bush era, the first Bush, where you know, there was ""Focus On The Family"" and there was a huge fight happening nationally, actually, about abstinence only education in schools and then comprehensive sex health ed. And I was right in the middle of that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So you became an activist at 12.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Very much so.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: For the availability of contraceptives in your school.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And did that sort of awaken that kind of part of you?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It did. It did. I really enjoyed not only kind of uncovering truth, how I thought about it, but also really thought it was important that people had the information that they needed to make decisions that were right for them and been going ever since.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: So what was it like? You said you were one of the few black people where you were growing up.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Literally one of the few.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And your parents were a mixed-race marriage. How do you think that sort of formed your consciousness, your perception?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, in a lot of ways, it made me really conscious of being different.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I can imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So conscious of being different. And you know, I mean, in the town that I grew up in, you know, which is relatively liberal, right, compared to most places, I remember that my mom would get pulled over in my town and she would have to call my dad to come and pick her up and vouch for her.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Vouch.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Because literally, the police in this very small community didn't believe that this woman who's driving a Mercedes or whatever she was driving at the time actually lived there, that the car was hers. And my parents lived in that community for about 25 years.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And that would happen with you in the car.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Totally. It would happen with me in the car. That would happen without me in the car. You know, it's very common.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You know, a thing I think about a lot. I think about how tall people, I think particularly tall women who get tall very early, they tend to slouch, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's protective, but it always strikes me that there's this incredible thing that's happening which is that your perception of the world and the way that you move through the world and stick out in it is actually having the subconscious effect on your spine, right?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Absolutely.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: And it's I think about that a lot in the context of different kinds of difference, whether that's disability or race. That's doing some work way below whatever is in the prefrontal cortex.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's all the way down through the cells, moving through that world.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: That's right and being very conscious of the fact that you're always being watched and having to kind of get comfortable in that. And I think when I was younger, I was very uncomfortable with it. I really wanted to blend in. But there was no possible way for me to do that, literally no possible way. And so it forced me to get comfortable really early with not only being okay with being different, but being okay in my own skin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Was the move toward activism when you're 12, which is young, do you remember that as part of that kind of processing of that difference or something? Like claiming it in some way, right? If you're the focus of attention, you have agency over that, over the eyeballs, right, if you're putting yourself out there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't remember. I mean what I know is that I loved talking to my peers about sex and desire and intimacy and also, you know.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You're not from a Catholic household.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: No. Definitely not. Definitely not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I love talking to my peers about sex and intimacy. Yeah.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. And I was even having sex at the time.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: That's totally my upbringing.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Which is even funnier. But you know, I mean part of it is I do think that what felt important to me was that women like my mother could have the choice as to whether or not they wanted to have a me. My mom had me at what was relatively a young age. I mean she was in her mid-to-late 20s when she had me and I'm in my late 30s and I cannot imagine.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don't have kids yet and I'm still ... You know, I twitch at the idea. So think about this woman who's, you know, 28 years old and she's trying to figure out what she's going to do. Her whole life is changing in front of her eyes and had my mom been in a state, for example, where abortions were banned or birth control was limited, she would not have the same range of choices that she had with me. And I think that everybody should be able to have the same range of choices. And that's what really drove me.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">A lot of the people that I went to school with, you know, they were from wealthy households. My household wasn't wealthy, but their household was. And people weren't talking openly about things that were happening right in front of their eyes. I wasn't having sex at 12, but a lot of my peers were and were doing it in ways that were not safe and not protected. And it wasn't because people were reckless, it's literally because their families were not having these conversations with them. The only place they could have that conversation was at school and people are debating whether or not that conversation should happen in a place of learning.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I think I was really motivated by filling a gap, but also, really making sure that everybody was as empowered as I felt and as my mother was when she decided after she learned she was pregnant she was going to have me. But she had choices and she could have chosen something else, right? And that's the whole point. So that's what motivated me, and it still motivates me today.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: You've done organizing, right, in sort of more formal or less formal settings, I think.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: After Trayvon Martin's death, tell me what happened. You wrote a post about using the phrase Black Lives Matter.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: I did. I was sitting at a bar with friends. We heard that the verdict was going to be announced that day. We were ...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: This is the Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: The Zimmerman verdict.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It wasn't during the death. It was when the trial happened ... I remember that summer I was on the air at that point.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Yeah. It was during the trial. And I had been watching it religiously. I was really fascinated by it, really fascinated by the way in which Trayvon was reconstructed to be a grown man who was a hulk and scary. I was really fascinated by the way that his friend was treated. I think her name was Rachelle. The way she was ridiculed about her literacy levels and how she talked. And she was really defiant in the courtroom, which I thought was awesome. I was like, ""Get it, girl."" You know what I mean? You don't have to tell anybody anything you don't want to. But she was really vilified for that.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I was fascinated by the way his parents and his mother, especially, was vilified for not paying enough attention to him or not watching him. And I was horrified when I was seeing pictures that they were showing of this child, you know, flashing money, trying to turn him into an archetype that he very much was not.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And so when they announced that the verdict was going to be read later that day, I was on the edge of my seat. Friends and I went and had some drinks and we were talking about what we thought was going to happen. None of us expected that George Zimmerman was going to walk. All of us expected that there would be some consequences that he would have to face. After all, it was 2013. It's not 1965 or 1954, right? We don't kill kids in this country and get away with it, is what we thought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But actually, what we found is that you can, and you can because there are laws in states like Florida, in states like California that allow you to protect your property, especially if you're in a position where you ""feel scared.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: So in California, where I'm from, they call those king of the castle doctrines. In Florida, they're stand your ground laws. And after that verdict was read, I literally felt like I got punched in the gut. And I didn't know Trayvon. And I didn't have a relationship with his family, but I had become so invested in what I was seeing that it did feel personal to me. And I have a brother who's eight years younger than me and he's six foot something and he's black and he lives in Marin County.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what terrified me is that Marin County is not that different from Sanford, Florida.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Right. Exactly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Not where he was living, right? He was living in basically a gated community and he was killed because he was black and living in a gated community where somebody decided that he didn't belong there.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So I went home that night, and I woke up in the middle of the night crying. And I wrote a Facebook post about it. And I wrote about a lot of things. But the thing that came to me first was just that all these people were talking about the verdict and there were all these responses and reactions, but very few of them refused to blame black people for the outcome of the trial. So...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: What do you mean by that?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Well, on the one hand you had, and this might be my algorithms right? I'll take responsibility for that. But on the one hand, I have my social justice homies who are like, why is anybody surprised that this happened? Criminal justice system doesn't deliver justice. So why are you as naive to expect that it would?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: I just want to say, I just want to briefly intervene to say that that is a very common trope on social media and that drives me absolutely bonkers.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Why are we doing this wet blanket thing?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Also like if you're worked up about something, God bless, that's the engine of anything.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: It's actually excellent. It's human.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: Yeah, like get worked up. It's just such...</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">ALICIA GARZA: Right.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">CHRIS HAYES: It's real common though. And it's like, no, I'm not saying that like I'm a naive. I'm saying that I'm-</p>, ...]"

Unfortunately, this is nothing new for the Black queer community; the architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">The architects and elders of the movement have been all but erased. This white gay privilege exists year-round, but it is particularly frustrating during Pride.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">All communities struggle in some way with race, and the LGBTQ community is no different. Racism has always played a role in relationships between white and Black queer people. Just as the movement for LGBTQ rights has been whitewashed, so has Pride month often felt like a white, gay-centered event — far removed from the leaders of the Stonewall riots.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In a <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/04/pride-month-column-1.html"" target=""_blank"">recent article for BET</a>, I discuss how the Stonewall riots should be considered an important part of Black history. Leaders like Marsha P Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie, Miss Major and several other Black transgender and queer people were on the front line for those six nights in the summer of 1969. And yet Roland Emmerlich’s 2015 movie ""<a href=""https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/stonewall-movie"">Stonewall</a>"" shamelessly <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/20/movies/roland-emmerichs-stonewall-finds-controversy.html"" target=""_blank"">downplayed the role Black queer people played</a> in leading the riots — going so far as having a white gay man throw the first brick, instead of Marsha P. Johnson.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Such revisionism is not just a feature of movies, however. White queers often benefit from the work of Black queers, only to distance themselves once their particular needs are met. Look no further than the <a href=""https://www.hrc.org/resources/hrc-issue-brief-hiv-aids-and-the-lgbt-community"">HIV epidemic</a>, which remains a major problem for Black and Brown men who have sex with men. The intersection of race <a href=""https://www.them.us/story/for-black-and-latino-men-aids-is-still-a-crisis"">creates additional barriers</a> like access to healthcare, medication and a proximity to higher infection rates. AfricanAmericans<a href=""https://www.hiv.gov/blog/hiv-african-american-community-progress-our-work-far-over"" target=""_blank""> make up more than 40 percent</a> of all people living with HIV in the United States, despite African Americans comprising only 12 percent of the U.S. population. Unfortunately, when HIV stopped being known as a primarily white gay epidemic, it began to feel more and more like an afterthought.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d7bd9k/gay-bars-can-be-mind-bogglingly-racist"">“safe spaces.”</a> In 2017 during Philly Pride, for example, the attempt was made to add a <a href=""https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/20/15821858/gay-pride-flag-philadelphia-fight-explained"">black and brown stripe</a> to the rainbow flag. This action was met with anger from white gay men who felt the flag represented unity despite skin color — a particularly tone-deaf defense given that Philadelphia's gay bars had recently become a hotbed for racism.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Although white queer people share in our queer oppression, they are still beneficiaries of white supremacy — and are not above wielding that power in our “safe spaces.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It isn’t a coincidence that in that same summer of 2017, 11 owners of queer spaces in Philadelphia went through <a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"">mandatory anti-discrimination</a> training after several incidents at various gay bars — including the discovery of a YouTube video showing bar owner Darryl DePiano using racial slurs in 2016, and other<a href=""https://philly.eater.com/2017/2/1/14474288/philly-gay-bars-anti-racism-icandy-woodys-discrimination"" target=""_blank""> alleged incidents</a> involving racial discrimination.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I experienced many of these <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"">same policies</a> in the Washington D.C. area when I used to live there. Gay bar Number 9 in D.C. used to charge a cover only on Fridays — the night that the crowd was primarily Black. Nellies, a gay sports bar in D.C., also removed certain liquors like Hennessy and hid its glassware on days known to attract Black patrons. The assumption here being that Hennessy is a “Black” drink, and that Black patrons are more violent and thus should only be trusted with plastic cups. Eventually Nellies was also forced to go through anti-discrimination training following complaints from several patrons, <a href=""https://www.out.com/news-opinion/2017/2/15/raise-bar-discrimination-queer-safe-spaces"" target=""_blank"">including the writer Preston Mitchum</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sadly, Pride month has never really been about having pride for Black queer people. We have long been burdened with the work of removing homophobia from Black communal spaces while also taking up the fight against racism in <em>all</em> spaces. We have seen a white gay man named <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/serial-predator-l-writer-has-been-sounding-alarm-ed-buck-n957776"" target=""_blank"">Ed Buck escape accountability</a> for the deaths of two Black gay men found in his home — a jarring reality that shows us just how much power white queers wield over queers of color. We watch violence occurring at alarming rates in the Black queer community while <a href=""https://www.bet.com/style/living/2019/06/07/rainbow-capitalism-is-harmful.html"">rainbow capitalism</a> continues to dominate an “inclusion” conversation that never seems to <em>include</em> us.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Black queer people are still fighting for survival, white queer people were fighting for marriage equality. This is not to say that marriage equality isn’t important, but it is certainly not the only fight. Although we all share the same oppressors, white queer folks must come to terms with the fact that they play a role in the harm experienced by Black and Brown queer folks — a problem they could stop if they acknowledge the privilege they have, this month and every month.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
125,We have to stop yelling at each other about abortion and start listening,59,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/abortion-we-need-stop-yelling-each-other-start-listening-everybody-ncna1024766,2019-06-30,2019,6,30,17,12,opinion,"[<p class=""menu-copyright"">© 2019 NBC NEWS.COM</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Have you ever innocently but loudly misrepresented a story for as long as you can remember and never checked the source material? Of course you haven’t; I never would either. Except that I have so many times.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is another one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Take <a href=""https://www.rawstory.com/2017/10/sci-fi-writer-baffles-abortion-foes-with-simple-question-would-you-save-1000-embryos-or-one-child-in-fire/"" target=""_blank"">this thought experiment by Patrick Tomlinson</a>: “You're in a fertility clinic. Why isn't important. The fire alarm goes off. You run for the exit. As you run down this hallway, you hear a child screaming from behind a door. You throw open the door and find a five-year-old child crying for help. They're in one corner of the room. In the other corner, you spot a frozen container labeled, ‘1000 Viable Human Embryos.’ The smoke is rising. You start to choke. You know you can grab one or the other but not both before you succumb to smoke inhalation and die - saving no one. Do you A) save the child, or B) save the thousand embryos? There is no C. ‘C’ means you all die.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">This is a hypothetical ultimately meant to test whether one truly believes that life begins at conception and a human embryo has the same value as the life of a child standing before you.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Historically in philosophical inquiries of this kind where, say, the choice is between pulling a lever on a speeding train that would kill one man to avoid a collision that would kill five, <a href=""http://healthland.time.com/2011/12/05/would-you-kill-one-person-to-save-five-new-research-on-a-classic-debate/"" target=""_blank"">studies show</a> that 90 percent of people choose to save more people at the expense of one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, I used to think that I was landing a rhetorical deathblow when discussing Tomlinson's scenario and it becomes undeniable that no one can really say in earnest that 1,000 embryos are equal to the life of an actual child when danger looms. And I must admit, I am usually waiting for the victorious moment where I say something like, “Seems like you’re struggling. Do you really believe these embryos are actual kids? If you really did believe that, it wouldn't be that hard of a choice for one kid to burn and you are clearly just a woman-hating-liar-fraud with twisty snakes for brains and cleverly hidden horns. Hahahahaha! I gotcha!""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I don’t actually say that, but, in my head, I smile beatifically while ascending onto imaginary stage at a strip mall where to be awarded a medal by the ghosts of famous feminists; I can’t wait for ""pro-lifers” to squirm and repent under the irrefutable mirror I feel I am holding up to their dogmatic moral confusion.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">It’s gross to admit, but that’s what I’m doing. I have long since ceased to listen, in any meaningful way, to the other side.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">And what I realized writing this is that I’ve been telling the story wrong the whole time. The way I have been telling it, there is a grown woman behind the clinic door crying for help, instead of the five-year-old child. I smugly misremembered that’s how the story went and I never checked again. The original thought experiment using the child is much more effective in uncovering where our allegiances lie in terms of where life begins.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But in this culture war, it was just as easy to imagine it as a choice between a live woman or the embryos. That's how it feels, and that’s how I heard it. Telling it that way forces whomever I am sparring against to admit that their stance on the issue is not complicated at all. They must value the tangible life of an individual adult woman over the ambiguously defined potential in the box. If they don’t, they have a clear disdain for women — even, and especially, if they are one.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">I have been pitting women against each other with my strident lecturing. I have chosen to believe that it isn't difficult to reconcile this hypothetical choice with their actual religious beliefs or their lived experiences, that they should just know it’s only wrong to leave the woman to the fire. (And it might be, but that’s not the point.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">In my quest to protect the autonomy and freedom of women, I have become the ultimate conversation stopper. There is nothing to which I don’t have a counterargument, no silence I can’t fill with more statistics. In my head at these moments, I'm wearing a Katherine Hepburn lawyer-type outfit with <a href=""https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a20874652/sophie-ratner-1973-necklace-roe-v-wade/"" target=""_blank"">a 1973 necklace</a> on to represent Roe v. Wade — trust me, it screams ""very confident."" But these are not the actions of a confident woman.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">No, truthfully, my rhetoric is the reaction of a throaty wild animal sensing the fire. I can feel the room getting smaller and filling with smoke. I am the woman trapped in the fire. I’m sure that the people that burst in the door will choose the theoretical in the refrigerated box over the real woman pleading and coughing in front of them.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">How can I become a better listener if I am this afraid? Can we afford to put down our weapons for a moment in this stand off? Do we do it on the count of three? How can I trust you? Or how can you trust me when I have hijacked the conversation and made you my hostage?</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Aspen Baker, founder of the women empowering nonprofit group <a href=""https://exhaleprovoice.org"" target=""_blank"">Exhale</a> created a platform/philosophy called “Pro- Voice” that seeks to bridge this battleground. It has only two tenets: That people should listen and share stories. <a href=""http://www.aspenbaker.com/what-is-pro-voice"" target=""_blank"">Her website says</a>, ""Pro-voice focuses on the all-to-often ignored or exploited personal experiences with abortion."" In a 2015 TED Talk, <a href=""https://blog.ted.com/be-pro-voice-aspen-baker-flips-the-conversation-on-abortion-at-tedwomen-2015/"" target=""_blank"">she expanded on that idea</a>: ""The feminist who regrets her abortion. The Catholic grateful for hers... Personal abortion stories don't fit neatly into one camp or the other.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Another organization I love called “<a href=""https://www.aisfor.org/"" target=""_blank"">A is For</a>,"" and it seeks to fund access for all reproductive care and to end the obstructions preventing it. But, they also seek to reduce the stigma surrounding abortion by sharing stories. Recently, as more anti-abortion bills were passed in Alabama, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, North Dakota, Utah, Kansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, A is For gathered and shared the stories of women living in those states, no matter what side of the issue they favored.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Sharing stories, and the empathy of real listening might be the only thing that has ever touched a heart or changed a mind.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">If gentle listening, if really telling and hearing stories could disarm the bomb that begins ticking on this battleground every time the opposing sides meet, why do I still have a secret gun, a detonator in my pocket and a knife in my boot? Because another gross thing to admit is that I’m not ready to do what I espouse. I’d rather show you the other versions of this article that are, in fact, ticking and armed with explosions of my rightness. Just me feeling very right over and over! (And I'm wearing the Katherine Hepburn lawyer- type outfit, duh.)</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">But the true story that we need to hear is that <a href=""https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states"" target=""_blank"">one in four American women will have an abortion by age 45</a> and we need to listen to them — as well as the women who chose differently. Barbara Kingsolver, who is a brilliant writer and badass Appalachian woman after my heart <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/now/printable/transcript_kingsolver_print.html"" target=""_blank"">once said</a>, “Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It is the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else’s pain is as meaningful as your own.”</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">So, even though I am scared and prideful, I am offering to lay down my weapons so that I can listen to the stories — all of them, not just the ones that fit my perspective. Will you join me?

""Be proud of the Flag that you wear.""</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Trump was reacting to a new viral video in which Rapinoe, asked <a href=""https://twitter.com/AndrewDasNYT/status/1143918087735054336"">months ago</a> whether she would visit the White House if invited by the president, responded casually: “Pfft. I’m not going to the f------ White House.” Rapinoe isn’t alone either — teammates Alex Morgan, Ali Krieger and Becky Sauerbrunn have all shared similar sentiments publicly.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Apparently to Trump, this means that Rapinoe and her highly decorated teammates don’t respect their country and aren’t patriotic enough.

They were demanding a living wage so they don’t need second jobs, a calendar of regular games to stay sharp and protections so if players get injured (or pregnant) their careers wouldn’t be stuck in limbo — benefits their male counterparts already enjoyed. Their efforts have served as inspiration to women’s national teams around the world, who have followed the USA’s lead.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">Trump, who in the same tweet claimed to be “a big fan” of women’s soccer, clearly doesn’t know much about Megan Rapinoe or the U.S. women’s national team.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Earlier this year, the American players <a class=""vilynx_listened"" href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-women-s-soccer-team-files-gender-discrimination-suit-n980981"">sued their boss</a>, the U.S. Soccer Federation, alleging longtime institutionalized gender discrimination. The headline-grabbing part of the lawsuit was about equal pay, but the complaint makes a larger and more compelling point about female athletes <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-murray-us-womens-national-soccer-team-world-cup-lawsuit-federation-20190620-story.html"">being treated as an afterthought</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe, who is openly gay, has been perhaps the most outspoken of her teammates.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">She was the first white athlete to join in NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s ongoing protest over police brutality and other racial inequalities by kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. That was the moment that Rapinoe — an affable, gregarious and witty fan-favorite — managed to become a lightning rod. The player who once memorably celebrated a World Cup goal by running over to a field microphone and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oepayP5R33g"">belting out</a> “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen was suddenly being called un-American.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">The U.S. Soccer Federation swiftly <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/04/us-soccer-players-stand-respectfully-national-anthem"">passed a new bylaw</a> requiring players to stand for the national anthem, forcing Rapinoe to back off her protest. But Rapinoe says she has no regrets over the ordeal.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">""I feel like I'm a walking protest,” she <a href=""https://sports.yahoo.com/megan-rapinoe-is-a-walking-protest-162416461.html"">once explained</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Some critics are quick to declare that Rapinoe and her teammates ought to “stick to sports.” But sports are inherently political, and indeed history is filled with expressions of protest from athletes. From deliberate ones, like <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/10/16/a-cry-freedom-black-power-salute-that-rocked-world-years-ago/?utm_term=.df3efdc1b13e"" target=""_blank"">Tommie Smith and John Carlos’ iconic Black Power salute</a> during the 1968 Olympics, to passive ones like gold medalist <a href=""https://www.biography.com/news/jesse-owens-adolf-hitler-1936-olympics"" target=""_blank"">Jesse Owens serving as the foil to Hitler’s vision</a> of white supremacy at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">For Rapinoe and the U.S. women’s national team, their form of protest is both.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">While Rapinoe doesn’t flinch at calling out the mistreatment of female athletes and the unfair burdens of intersectionality — and she has labeled Trump “sexist,” “misogynistic,” “small-minded,” “racist” and “not a good person” — even her more reserved teammates manage to make their own statements on the soccer field.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">“I think our existence in professional sports is almost a protest in and of itself in the very sexist society that we live in,” Rapinoe <a href=""https://eu.azcentral.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/10/24/moore-us-soccer-megan-rapinoe-womens-pro-athletes-protest/797253001/"">once said</a>.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do. Despite Trump’s doubts about Rapinoe’s respect for her country, her actions obviously stem from a belief that she is advocating for something bigger than herself. And she is sending a clear message to the youth of America, girls and boys, about what it looks like when athletes use their platform to advocate for others.</p>, <p class=""text___2iNlR ma0 mt6 f8 lh-none founders-cond"">There’s an argument to be made that protest in the name of progress — in the name of looking forward — is the most patriotic thing an athlete can do.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Rapinoe has admitted she has never suffered the racial injustices that Kaepernick and other people of color have, but she still kneeled and suffered the backlash anyway. Rapinoe has admitted she will never see the benefits of the gains she <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Changed-Soccer/dp/1419734490/"">helped fight for in the women team’s new collective bargaining agreement</a>, but she dug her heels in anyway.</p>, <p class=""endmarkEnabled"">Indeed, Rapinoe and the women’s national team are exactly the type of athletes — exactly the type of people — who should be welcomed into the White House. But not out of spite or as part of some manufactured culture war from Trump, whose presidency has been built on such divisive stunts. Rapinoe and the women of the women’s national team couldn’t be better examples of patriots, whether or not they beat France in Friday’s quarterfinal and continue their campaign to defend their World Cup title.</p>, <p class=""articleByline__bio bio___3q2CD publico-txt f2 lh-copy mt3 mt0-m ml9-m"">Caitlin Murray is the author of “<a href=""https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/national-team_9781419734496/"">The National Team: The Inside Story Of The Women Who Changed Soccer</a>,” a narrative history of the U.S. women's national soccer team.</p>, <p>© 2019 NBC UNIVERSAL</p>]"
