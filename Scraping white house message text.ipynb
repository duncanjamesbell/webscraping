       " <p>The nation is doing well economically, better than anybody in the world.\\xa0 We\\u2019re the hot nation of the world and it\\u2019s nice to know you\\u2019re fighting, and you\\u2019re fighting for something that\\u2019s doing well, and that\\u2019s our country.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I want to begin by welcoming Colonel Stephanie Barton and the men and women of the 101st Airborne Division.\\xa0 These are real warriors.\\xa0 And you have the Resolute Support Sustainment Brigade and they are joining us from Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan, where our soldiers are providing invaluable aid in combined joint area operations throughout Afghanistan.</p>,\n",
       " <p>You are doing an incredible job.\\xa0 A lot of progress has been made and your courage truly inspires us all.\\xa0 We know what you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 We watch it.\\xa0 And oftentimes we\\u2019re watching it every night during the news.\\xa0 And we know it\\u2019s dangerous and we also know that you\\u2019ve had an unbelievable impact.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Joining us from al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait is the Central Command \\u2014 response and Crisis Response Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force.\\xa0 Lieutenant Colonel Sam Howie, you are really great Marines and you\\u2019re the embodiment of honor, and courage, and commitment.</p>,\n",
       " <p>It\\u2019s incredible, the job you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 I particularly want to congratulate you on the work you\\u2019ve done to crush ISIS from the air and from the ground.\\xa0 And really it\\u2019s \\u2014 big, big progress has been made.\\xa0 They\\u2019re very close to being gone and we like it that way.\\xa0 But you have shown incredible courage.\\xa0 And I have to say, you\\u2019ve shown great, great leadership.\\xa0 So, thank you very much.\\xa0 And, Lieutenant Colonel, thank you very much and we\\u2019ll be talking to you in a little while.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Happy Thanksgiving as well to Captain Pat Hannifin and all of the sailors aboard the USS Ronald Reagan.\\xa0 Great ship.\\xa0 Your ship\\u2019s motto is one that we embrace every day: Peace Through Strength.\\xa0 That\\u2019s what the motto is, and we have that motto at home.\\xa0 Everywhere the Seventh Fleet sails, the USS Ronald Reagan is an enduring symbol of American might, American strength, American power and, really, American goodness, in so many ways.</p>,\n",
       " <p>From the United States Air Force, we\\u2019re joined by the 455th Air Expeditionary Wing, which is supporting Operation Freedom\\u2019s Sentinel and NATO\\u2019s Resolute Support.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Brigadier General David Lyons \\u2014 thank you very much, David \\u2014 is the Commander.\\xa0 And I want to congratulate you and every <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">minute</span> [member] of the 455th for your outstanding work.\\xa0 Not only have you destroyed hundreds of ISIS \\u2014 and actually far more than hundreds \\u2014 and many, many Taliban targets, but you protect coalition ground forces throughout the region.\\xa0 And you protect them like nobody else.\\xa0 It\\u2019s incredible the job you do.\\xa0 And I just want to thank you all for being on.\\xa0 And I have to say, General, it\\u2019s great to speak to you by teleconference and by phone because your reputation is an incredible one.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Representing the U.S. Coast Guard are crewmembers from six Coast Guard cutters and from the shore support teams that are part of Patrol Forces Southwest Asia, which is the largest Coast Guard unit outside of the United States.\\xa0 And I\\u2019m actually going right now \\u2014 I\\u2019m in Palm Beach, Florida, and I\\u2019m going over to your local Coast Guard station and we\\u2019re going to spend some great time with the men and women of the Coast Guard.</p>,\n",
       " <p>They have, from a lot of standpoints, you could call it branding, you could call it whatever you want, the job they\\u2019ve done on hurricanes in this country.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve saved thousands and thousands of people.\\xa0 In fact, in Texas, they saved over 12,000 people.\\xa0 If you think of what that means, over 12,000 people.\\xa0 They went into seas and they went into areas that nobody else would go into.\\xa0 And it was incredible.\\xa0 What they\\u2019ve done in Texas, what they did in Florida, what they did in Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard has really become a symbol of strength and perseverance and toughness and genius, actually.\\xa0 It\\u2019s purely genius.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, hello to Lieutenant Nicholas Hartmann who is the Commanding Officer of the cutter Aquidneck.\\xa0 And I also want to congratulate Seaman Christopher Wilson on being selected for \\u201cA\\u201d school.\\xa0 That\\u2019s \\u201cA,\\u201d like in \\u201cA.\\u201d\\xa0 That\\u2019s the best, right?\\xa0 Seaman Wilson, you truly make us proud.\\xa0 Congratulations.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a big deal.\\xa0 Going to that school is like going to the Wharton School of Finance, if you happen to be doing what you do.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And to everyone on today\\u2019s videoconference also, I want to thank you all for serving.\\xa0 Today we thank God for the blessings of having you people be our heroes, and you really are our heroes.\\xa0 And your families are back here and they love you, and they respect you and they look forward to seeing you because you\\u2019re the ones who keep America safe and strong and free.\\xa0 You do a job like nobody else.\\xa0 And it is really great respect that we all have.\\xa0 You are very much appreciated, like you wouldn\\u2019t believe, by the American public, by the citizens of our country.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I want to maybe start with the Air Force.\\xa0 And I know that Brigadier General David Lyons is on the phone.\\xa0 And, David, tell me a little bit about what you\\u2019re doing.</p>,\n",
       " <p>BRIGADIER GENERAL LYONS:\\xa0 Our mission here, we defend the two busiest airfields in Afghanistan: Kandahar and Bagram.\\xa0 We support our teammates and our mission set, and then we deliver decisive combat air power across the entire country of Afghanistan.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Mr. President, I know you can\\u2019t see us right now, but you\\u2019ve got 150 airmen in this room that would love to say Happy Thanksgiving to you.\\xa0 (Inaudible), what do you say to the President?</p>,\n",
       " <p>PARTICIPANTS:\\xa0 Happy Thanksgiving!</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\u2019s great. \\xa0Well, that\\u2019s really fantastic.\\xa0 How are things going over there?\\xa0 Are they \\u2014 are you looking up?\\xa0 How is looking to you?\\xa0 You\\u2019ve seen it.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been there a while and you\\u2019ve seen what\\u2019s going on.\\xa0 You know what\\u2019s happening better than anybody.\\xa0 How do you find things going?</p>,\n",
       " <p>BRIGADIER GENERAL LYONS: Well, both the Taliban and ISIS are resilient adversaries, but I think that we\\u2019re doing well.\\xa0 We get after them every single day.\\xa0 Our objective here is to fight the away game.\\xa0 And so what I mean by that is we never want this adversary to reach our shores again.\\xa0 And so every airman here is dedicated to keeping this fight away from our shores.\\xa0 A stable Afghanistan is good for Afghanistan, but we do what we do for America, sir.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, said it better than anybody could have said: \\u201cKeep them away from our shores.\\u201d\\xa0 And that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re doing the strong border.\\xa0 As you probably see over the news what\\u2019s happening in our southern border and our southern border territory.\\xa0 Large numbers of people, and in many cases, we have no idea who they are.\\xa0 And in many cases, they\\u2019re not good people; they\\u2019re bad people.\\xa0 But large numbers of people are forming at our border, and I don\\u2019t have to even ask you; I know what you want to do.\\xa0 You want to make sure that you know who we\\u2019re letting in.\\xa0 And we\\u2019re not letting in anybody essentially because we want to be very, very careful.\\xa0 So, you\\u2019re right.\\xa0 You\\u2019re doing it over there, we\\u2019re doing it over here.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And your people at the border, we have the military at the border for the first time.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s ever \\u2014 or certainly there\\u2019s never been a presence like this, but we have a very powerful border now.\\xa0 We have the concertina fencing and we have things that people don\\u2019t even believe.\\xa0 We took old, broken wall and we wrapped it with barbed wire-plus.\\xa0 I guess you could really call it \\u201cbarbed wire-plus.\\u201d\\xa0 This is the ultimate.\\xa0 And nobody is getting through these walls.\\xa0 And we\\u2019re going to make sure they\\u2019re the right people because that\\u2019s what you and your family want and all of your families, that\\u2019s what they want.\\xa0 And that\\u2019s why we\\u2019re all fighting.\\xa0 You know, we\\u2019re fighting for borders.\\xa0 We\\u2019re fighting for our country.\\xa0 If we don\\u2019t have borders, we don\\u2019t have a country.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So we\\u2019re doing very well on the southern border.\\xa0 We\\u2019re very tough.\\xa0 We get a lot of bad court decisions from the Ninth Circuit, which has become a big thorn in our side.\\xa0 We always lose and then you lose again and again, and then you hopefully win at the Supreme Court, which we\\u2019ve done.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s a terrible thing when judges take over your protective services; when they tell you how to protect your border.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a disgrace.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, we\\u2019re winning and you\\u2019re winning.\\xa0 And I appreciate it very much.\\xa0 And, General, your reputation is an incredible one.\\xa0 Thank you very much for doing the job, and I\\u2019ll see you back when you\\u2019re in the United States.\\xa0 Or maybe I\\u2019ll even see you over there.\\xa0 You never know what\\u2019s going to happen.</p>,\n",
       " <p>BRIGADIER GENERAL LYONS: \\xa0Thank you, Mr. President. \\xa0We appreciate that.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Really great.\\xa0 And thank all the men and women with you.\\xa0 Really spectacular people.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Well, next, let\\u2019s talk to the U.S. Coast Guard Commanding Officer of Coast Guard cutter Aquidneck.\\xa0 And it would be Lieutenant Nick Hartmann.\\xa0 And so, Nick, tell me a little bit about what you\\u2019re doing, where you are, and how\\u2019s it going.</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT HARTMANN:\\xa0 Good morning, Mr. President.\\xa0 This is Nicholas Hartmann, like you mentioned, from Coast Guard cutter Aquidneck.\\xa0 Here in the room we have 14 members from Patrol Forces Southwest Asia.\\xa0 And we\\u2019re located in the Kingdom of Bahrain, Mr. President.\\xa0 Our mission out here is to patrol the Arabian Gulf Straits of Hormuz and conduct our U.S. Central Command and NAVCENT objectives here in the Gulf.</p>,\n",
       " <p>A lot of our work is partnering and building relationships with the Gulf Coast countries, and so that we have a good standing and resolve here in the Arabian Gulf and in Central Command AOR.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Things, in my opinion, Mr. President, are going very well for us.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And what do you see in the region?\\xa0 What\\u2019s going on in the region?\\xa0 How are they feeling about things?\\xa0 How are they feeling about trade?\\xa0 Because, you know, trade for me is a very big subject all over.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been taken advantage of for many, many years by bad trade deals.\\xa0 We don\\u2019t have any good trade deals.\\xa0 How are you finding things in the region, Nick?</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT HARTMANN:\\xa0 Mr. President, from our perspective out on the water, sir, we\\u2019re seeing that there is an abundance of trade happening in the region.\\xa0 There are vessels moving through the Straits of Hormuz and across the Arabian Gulf on a daily basis carrying cargo to and fro.\\xa0 And we don\\u2019t see any issues in terms of trade right now, sir.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 Well, you\\u2019ll keep it that way.\\xa0 And you know, we want to have good, free trade.\\xa0 And we also want to have fair deals where we can do well too.\\xa0 Not just everybody else.\\xa0 Right now, every nation in the world does well with us; we don\\u2019t do well with them.\\xa0 So that\\u2019s changing and it\\u2019s changing fast.\\xa0 And where you are is a big factor in that, as you know.\\xa0 You\\u2019ve been told and you\\u2019ve been briefed.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Well, I want to thank you very much, Nick.\\xa0 And great job.\\xa0 And again, as I said, there\\u2019s no brand that\\u2019s gone up like the Coast Guard over the last couple of years because of what you\\u2019ve done with the hurricanes in this country.\\xa0 People saw things that they\\u2019ve never seen before.\\xa0 The bravery of those \\u2014 of your people going out in waves like \\u2014 like, you know, record setting.\\xa0 It\\u2019s been record setting.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The one hurricane in Texas, they say, dumped more water and it was more violent in terms of water than anything we\\u2019ve ever had in the country.\\xa0 And you guys went out there and you did it like just a day in the office.\\xa0 And I really appreciate it.\\xa0 We all really appreciate it, Nick.\\xa0 And thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you very much.</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT HARTMANN:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And Happy Thanksgiving.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 You take care of yourself.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Let\\u2019s go to the Army.\\xa0 Good old Army.\\xa0 We love the Army.\\xa0 We have Colonel Stephanie Barton of the U.S. Army.\\xa0 And, Stephanie, tell us a little bit about yourself and where you are, and what you\\u2019re focused on and what you\\u2019re doing.</p>,\n",
       " <p>COLONEL BARTON:\\xa0 First and foremost, good morning and Happy Thanksgiving on behalf of the 101st Sustainment Brigade.\\xa0 We\\u2019re currently located in Bagram, Afghanistan.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Sir, what we do for the country of Afghanistan, we\\u2019re the senior logistics headquarters in theater.\\xa0 And it is an away game \\u2014 and I will tell you, in order to fight and win the nation\\u2019s wars, it\\u2019s because of sustainment and logistics.\\xa0 And you\\u2019ve got highly motivated, true professionals in this room and outside this room that are truly making it happen.</p>,\n",
       " <p>We support \\u2014 if it\\u2019s in the hands of the warfighter, it comes through us, to them.\\xa0 So we support everything from coalition to joint forces, from border to border here in the country, sir.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good and how are you finding things in Afghanistan right now?</p>,\n",
       " <p>COLONEL BARTON:\\xa0 Sir, it\\u2019s good.\\xa0 We\\u2019re truly making the mission happen when it comes to sustainment.\\xa0 We\\u2019re response for all the strategic, operational, and tactical logistics.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Like I said, if it comes in the theater, we get it in the warfighters\\u2019 hand.\\xa0 But we have a phenomenal team and I can\\u2019t speak enough about that.\\xa0 Because a lot of the times, it\\u2019s the sustainment (inaudible) we\\u2019re behind the scenes, which is fine.\\xa0 But it\\u2019s a good team effort and it takes the support by all to make it happen.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, Colonel, how many people are you commanding right now, would you say?</p>,\n",
       " <p>COLONEL BARTON:\\xa0\\xa0 Sir, 10,000.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Wow.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a lot of people.\\xa0 That\\u2019s fantastic, Stephanie.\\xa0 That\\u2019s beautiful.\\xa0 That\\u2019s beautiful.\\xa0 And not only is it important what you\\u2019re doing, but you\\u2019re enjoying what you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 Is that right?</p>,\n",

       " <p>So, we do hate that we\\u2019re not with our family and friends today, but I\\u2019ll tell you, we are a close family here and I\\u2019m truly happy to be a part of it.\\xa0 It takes the whole community, from (inaudible) theaters to civilians, to make it happen.\\xa0 And, sir, you would be very proud, because we truly are.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\u2019s fantastic.\\xa0 We\\u2019re proud of you.\\xa0 And I\\u2019ll tell you what, we\\u2019re proud of your people.\\xa0 And please say hello to everybody.\\xa0 Have an incredible Thanksgiving and know we\\u2019re taking good care of you.\\xa0 You know, the budget is now at $716 billion, Stephanie.\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 So, we\\u2019re getting rid of some of that old equipment that you \\u2014 you see what\\u2019s going in.\\xa0 The best in the world, right?</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, you see a big difference.\\xa0 It\\u2019s an awfully big difference from what we had before.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s only getting better.\\xa0 We\\u2019ll be stronger than ever before.\\xa0 And with people like you, we feel very confident.</p>,\n",

       " <p>LIEUTENANT COLONEL HOWIE:\\xa0 I\\u2019m the executive officer, and I\\u2019m here with several Marines who would like to wish you and our fellow Americans a Happy Thanksgiving.\\xa0 (Inaudible.)</p>,\n",

       " <p>LIEUTENANT COLONEL HOWIE:\\xa0 It\\u2019s going great, sir.\\xa0 Right now, with the Special Purpose MAGTF.\\xa0 We\\u2019re based in Kuwait.\\xa0 But we have Marines from Jordan all the way up to Afghanistan, and up into Iraq and Syria.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And, every day, those Marines are ensuring that those who do us harm, pays for it.\\xa0 It\\u2019s pretty amazing watching you \\u2014 what you\\u2019ve done with men and women tells the Marines and what they do \\u2014 puts a smile on their face every day.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And how is the progress coming, would you say?</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT COLONEL HOWIE:\\xa0 I would say the progress is excellent, sir.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve moved throughout those areas and cleared the vast majority of those enemy forces who face us.\\xa0 And right now, I think we\\u2019re in a good position to continue to (inaudible) the rest of the year or foreseeable future.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\u2019s great.\\xa0 That\\u2019s great.\\xa0 I\\u2019m hearing very good things.\\xa0 And they treat you good over there I imagine?\\xa0 Right?\\xa0 Do they treat you good?</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT COLONEL HOWIE: \\xa0Sir, outstanding.\\xa0 Our partners throughout, including here at al-Jaber Air Base.\\xa0 For the Air Force, they treat us like gold.\\xa0 We want for nothing and today we had a \\u2014 I think everyone can agree, a fantastic Thanksgiving dinner here aboard the base.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\u2019s great.\\xa0 That\\u2019s great.\\xa0 Well, they should.\\xa0 We\\u2019re good friends and they\\u2019ve been a good ally.\\xa0 We treat them well and they treat us well.\\xa0 And a lot of good things are happening over there.\\xa0 People are surprised to see how fast things are turning around.\\xa0 But you have one of the great bases.\\xa0 You have something that\\u2019s incredible and special.\\xa0 And we\\u2019ll get to see you very soon.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And I will say \\u2014 and say hello to everybody else \\u2014 but I will say, I want you to have a great Thanksgiving.\\xa0 You are \\u2014 what\\u2019s the time difference?\\xa0 What \\u2014 what is your time lag over there?\\xa0 How many hours between, let\\u2019s say, East Coast?</p>,\n",
       " <p>LIEUTENANT COLONEL HOWIE:\\xa0 Right now, sir, it\\u2019s 18:00 in the evening.\\xa0 So it\\u2019s about an eight-hour difference between us.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 That\\u2019s a pretty big time difference, right?\\xa0 That\\u2019s a pretty big time difference.\\xa0 So you\\u2019ve celebrated.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Well, listen, you just take care of yourself and say hello to the Colonel and everybody.\\xa0 And you\\u2019re special people \\u2014 very, very special people \\u2014 and we\\u2019re very proud of you.\\xa0 And give my regards to Kuwait and everybody.</p>,\n",

       " <p>From the U.S. Navy, we have the Commanding Officer, Captain Pat Hannifin.\\xa0 And, Pat, are you on the phone?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 I\\u2019m with you.\\xa0 And from the over 4,800 sailors and airmen aboard USS Ronald Reagan, the nation\\u2019s only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier.</p>,\n",
       " <p>We are currently in Victoria Harbour, Hong Kong, about 13 hours ahead of you.\\xa0 It\\u2019s still Thanksgiving here.\\xa0 And from all the sailors aboard Reagan, serving peace through strength for America in the Indo-Pacific, we wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, that\\u2019s great, Pat.\\xa0 I appreciate it very much.\\xa0 And say hello to everybody, and Happy Thanksgiving to you.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, the condition of the ship is A1?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Alpha-1, sir.\\xa0 Absolutely.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Okay, good.\\xa0 Very important.\\xa0 So, you know, we have another big one.\\xa0 The Gerald Ford is going to be joining you pretty soon.\\xa0 How does this compare in size and scope with the Gerald Ford?\\xa0 You know all about that.\\xa0 That\\u2019s the new one, right?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 Size and scope.\\xa0 A good friend of mine just left command to that.\\xa0 But size and scope about the same.\\xa0 Certainly some improvements there to the plants and few of the \\u2014 and the radars and even the catapults and gear are slightly different as well.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So tell \\u2014 hey, Pat \\u2014</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN: \\xa0But we\\u2019ll push (inaudible) daily.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 Pat, tell me about the catapult system.\\xa0 So on the Gerald Ford they don\\u2019t use steam, which is the first one that I\\u2019ve ever heard of that doesn\\u2019t use steam.\\xa0 And I know they have some difficulties, which I\\u2019m not happy about.\\xa0 And they spent a lot of money.\\xa0 And I was just curious.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The steam system is tried and true for many, many years, as long as we\\u2019ve had aircraft carriers.\\xa0 How do you find steam versus what they\\u2019re doing on the Gerald Ford, which is electronic and digital, if you can believe it?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 All of our Nimitz supercarriers have been using steam for decades, and we find it pretty reliable.\\xa0 However, the electromagnetic catapults they\\u2019re running there offer some great benefits to \\u2014 obviously, like any new piece, you got to work through the bugs.\\xa0 But they offer some benefits not only to stress and strain on the aircraft; to extend service life and other pieces.\\xa0 I have no doubt we\\u2019ll work through that just as we work through all of our other advancements and continue to bring it to the enemy when called to do so.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 So, when you do the new carriers, as we do and as we\\u2019re thinking about doing, would you go with steam or would you go with electromagnetic?\\xa0 Because steam is very reliable, and the electromagnetic \\u2014 I mean, unfortunately you have to be Albert Einstein to really work it properly.\\xa0 What would you do?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 You sort of have to be Albert Einstein to run the nuclear power plants that we have here as well, but we\\u2019re doing that very well.\\xa0 I would go, sir \\u2014 Mr. President, I would go electromagnetic cast.\\xa0 I think that\\u2019s the way to go.\\xa0 We do pay a heavy cost for transiting the steam around the ship.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Good.\\xa0 Okay.\\xa0 I like to hear that.\\xa0 I\\u2019m actually happy about that answer, because at least, you know, they\\u2019re doing what they\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 But that\\u2019s actually a very good answer.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, Pat, how are you seeing things over there?\\xa0 What\\u2019s going on?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 We have been flying, sailing, and operating everywhere international law allows, just as we have for decades out here in full support of our free and open Indo-Pacific push in company with our Japanese and other allies.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve worked with the Japanese here in Keen Sword, the Australians, Canadians.\\xa0 So a lot of allies out here.\\xa0 And we are certainly their best friend and our ally.\\xa0 And our adversaries, their worst fear.\\xa0 And that\\u2019s exactly what we want to do is bring peace through strength to this region.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 And you have a six-month deployment, approximately?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Sir, we\\u2019re a little shorter than that. \\xa0But Reagan, as your only permanently forward-deployed carrier, spends about half of the time each year out, and about a half back in getting maintenance worked on it.\\xa0 Each of the sailors and airmen aboard spend three to five years out here with us at a time before going back to a stateside assignment.\\xa0 But we\\u2019re all honored to be serving the nation out here.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.\\xa0 Pat, why is it that the Reagan is the only one that\\u2019s permanently deployed of all the aircraft carriers?\\xa0 Why is that?\\xa0 Was it set up for that, or is \\u2014 it just happens to be?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 We have worked a single aircraft carrier out in Japan for decades now.\\xa0 Reagan took that role back in about 2013.\\xa0 I\\u2019m sorry \\u2014 that\\u2019s not quite right.\\xa0 About 2016.\\xa0 But it switches out.\\xa0 So, different carriers out here for different periods of time.\\xa0 It was George Washington before us.\\xa0 And then a few of the conventional carriers, you know, going way back to Midway and Kitty Hawk and Independence.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Right.</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 So we\\u2019ve been running that for a while.\\xa0 But \\u2014 and it\\u2019s just an infrastructure piece that takes quite a bit of infrastructure to make that work.\\xa0 But we get a lot of presence out of it for the region.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 And do you feel safe in the region?\\xa0 Do you see any hostility?\\xa0 Do you see any aggression?\\xa0 Because, you know, you\\u2019re hearing a little bit about aggression from a couple of the players.\\xa0 What are you feeling?</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Yes, sir.\\xa0 We have safe and independent operations out here throughout the theater.\\xa0 We do feel safe.\\xa0 There have been a couple of close calls, but in most cases, the vast majority, they are professional navies, and we have no doubt that we can bring that \\u2014 we bring the U.S. interest to the theater and expect that to continue into the future.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 That\\u2019s great, Pat.\\xa0 Well, I want to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving and say hello to everybody in the Navy.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And just in closing, I want to wish everybody a really, really Happy Thanksgiving, and we\\u2019ll see you when you\\u2019re back and maybe I\\u2019ll see you over there.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But it\\u2019s a great honor to talk to you.\\xa0 I know everything about what everyone is doing.\\xa0 And you\\u2019re doing an incredible job and you\\u2019re keeping us safe.\\xa0 And we all miss you back here.\\xa0 But we\\u2019ll be seeing you soon.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And on behalf of the whole country, I want to just thank you for what you\\u2019re doing.\\xa0 Very, very special people.\\xa0 Men and women that are just incredible people.\\xa0 You\\u2019re highly respected.\\xa0 And I\\u2019ll tell you what: Our country has such respect \\u2014 I don\\u2019t think you hear it enough \\u2014 but our country has such respect for you and the job you do.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, Happy Thanksgiving, and we will see you soon.</p>,\n",
       " <p>CAPTAIN HANNIFIN:\\xa0 Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. President.</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 Thank you all.\\xa0 Goodbye.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Great people.\\xa0 They\\u2019re great people.\\xa0 Okay?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, are you looking forward to going to Afghanistan or going to the Middle East for any of these?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We\\u2019re going to do some interesting things.\\xa0 At the appropriate time, we\\u2019ll be doing some very interesting things.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you have a sense of when yet, of when the trip might be?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Excuse me?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you have a sense of when the trip might be yet?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I do, but I can\\u2019t tell you.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\xa0 You\\u2019re the last people I can tell.</p>,\n",
       " <p>How is everything in Florida doing?\\xa0 Okay?\\xa0 Weather is good, right?\\xa0 It\\u2019s Florida.\\xa0 Welcome to the Southern White House.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Does the CIA have a recording of MBS demanding Khashoggi\\u2019s silence?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 I don\\u2019t want to talk about it.\\xa0 You have you ask them.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What about the border, Mr. President?\\xa0 We\\u2019ve seen some court \\u2014</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, the border is coming along very well.\\xa0 It\\u2019s become very strong.\\xa0 We\\u2019re getting some terrible decisions from the Ninth Circuit, as usual.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know if we\\u2019ve ever had a victory in the Ninth Circuit.\\xa0 We have to appeal it, appeal it.\\xa0 A vast number of their decisions get overturned, generally speaking, and it\\u2019s a shame.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a shame.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a disgrace, frankly.\\xa0 And essentially, they\\u2019re legislating.\\xa0 They\\u2019re saying what to do.\\xa0 Some judge, sitting in some location very far away, is telling our incredible military and law enforcement what to do.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s not right, and it\\u2019s been going on like that for a long time.\\xa0 And we are doing really well, considering the laws are a disaster.\\xa0 And if we had the right laws, it would be a lot less expensive, and we\\u2019d do it a lot easier.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But we don\\u2019t have the right laws, and we have people interpreting the laws, and they always give us a bad interpretation.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, hopefully, we\\u2019ve shown some light on the Ninth Circuit.\\xa0 I know that Chief Justice Roberts \\u2014 John Roberts \\u2014 has been speaking a little bit about it.\\xa0 And I think we\\u2019ve \\u2014 and I have a lot of respect for him.\\xa0 I like him and I respect him.\\xa0 But I think we have to use some common sense.\\xa0 The Ninth Circuit \\u2014 everybody knows it \\u2014 it\\u2019s totally out of control.\\xa0 And what they\\u2019re doing, what they\\u2019re saying, the opinions are very unfair to law enforcement.\\xa0 They\\u2019re very unfair to our military.\\xa0 And they\\u2019re very unfair, most importantly, to the people of our country, because I\\u2019m keeping them safe.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And you see how we\\u2019ve fortified things, and all of that \\u2014 all of that vast amount of fighting that you see going on at the border, it\\u2019s all taking place in Mexico.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And Mexico cannot believe how tough these people are.\\xa0 The mayor of Tijuana and so many others had said, \\u201cBoy, these are tough people.\\u201d\\xa0 They start fighting right away; they\\u2019re tough people.\\xa0 You have many criminals in that caravan, and the big caravan hasn\\u2019t arrived yet.\\xa0 And we\\u2019re very well fortified.\\xa0 We have fencing and walls like very few people have.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been able to do it rather quickly.\\xa0 Concertino wire \\u2014 Concertina wire.\\xa0 And so many other things are there now that they didn\\u2019t have.\\xa0 And they\\u2019re not coming through.\\xa0 We\\u2019re not letting criminals into our country.\\xa0 Got to come in legally.\\xa0 You have to come into a process.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And we want people to come in, because I have many, many companies moving back into the United States.\\xa0 They\\u2019re opening up car plants.\\xa0 They\\u2019re opening up factories all over the country.\\xa0 The United States is booming.\\xa0 We have the lowest unemployment we\\u2019ve, essentially, in most groups, ever had.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So we have a lot of good things happening.\\xa0 We need workers, but they have to come in legally.\\xa0 We want them to come in, but they have to be people that want to work and want to do a great job for our country.\\xa0 They come in through a merit system.\\xa0 They have to come in.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Right now, under the Democrats, they don\\u2019t have a merit system.\\xa0 They want open borders, and people can just flow in.\\xa0 You have tremendously dangerous people in those caravans.\\xa0 And we do not want them coming into the United States, and we\\u2019re not going to let them.</p>,\n",
       " <p>We\\u2019re throwing out MS-13 and so many others.\\xa0 We\\u2019re throwing them out of our country by the thousands that got in here over the years, and we\\u2019re throwing them out by the thousands.\\xa0 And we\\u2019re bringing back towns, we\\u2019re making towns safe, and we\\u2019re doing an excellent job.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But we\\u2019re getting hurt by the Ninth Circuit, very, very badly.\\xa0 Everybody files in the Ninth Circuit.\\xa0 I haven\\u2019t seen anybody file anyplace else.\\xa0 They automatically go to the Ninth Circuit.\\xa0 They could go anyplace in the country.\\xa0 And I think we\\u2019re going to have to stop that somehow.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The judges are going to have to get together, our Congress is going to have to get together and stop it.\\xa0 Because they\\u2019re taking advantage of our country by filing consistently and always \\u2014 just about, that I see \\u2014 in the Ninth Circuit.\\xa0 Even our legislation that we did have passed, it failed in the Ninth Circuit; it failed in the Ninth Circuit appeal.\\xa0 It then won in the Supreme Court.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And it\\u2019s just a shame, because it\\u2019s really hurting people.\\xa0 It\\u2019s hurting our law enforcement tremendously.\\xa0 And now that the military is on the border, it\\u2019s really hurting our military.\\xa0 And frankly, when they hear these decisions, these are professional.\\xa0 The military, the law enforcement, first responders, they can\\u2019t believe the decisions that are being made by these judges.</p>,\n",
       " <p>This is what they do; they do law enforcement, law and order.\\xa0 And they get these decisions now, and they say, \\u201cWho makes these decisions?\\u201d\\xa0 They\\u2019re not into the \\u2014 you know, lawyer things.\\xa0 They say, \\u201cWho makes these decisions? Who are the people that are giving these decisions that are going to make it unsafe for us,\\u201d meaning law enforcement and military, \\u201cand making it unsafe for the United States?\\u201d</p>,\n",
       " <p>So, despite that, we have a very powerful border, and a lot of good things are happening.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, are you concerned that by not punishing Saudi Arabia more, it could send a message to other world leaders that they can do as they please, and America could be weak in their eyes?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, not at all.\\xa0 Saudi Arabia has been a long-time strategic partner.\\xa0 They\\u2019re investing hundreds of billions of dollars in our country.\\xa0 I mean, hundreds of billions.\\xa0 They\\u2019re keeping the oil prices low.\\xa0 I see that yesterday, one of the papers, I was blamed for causing traffic jams because I have the oil prices so low.\\xa0 Well, I have the oil prices low because I\\u2019m jawboning them and others all the time to keep them low.\\xa0 Nobody ever did that.\\xa0 No President ever did that.\\xa0 And gasoline is now at a very low number.\\xa0 But I actually got even beat up for that, where they said, \\u201cThe President has the gasoline so low that he\\u2019s causing traffic jams.\\u201d\\xa0 Can you believe this one?\\xa0 I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s one nobody ever thought of.\\u201d\\xa0 So, anyway, no \\u2014 but I\\u2019ll always \\u2014 let\\u2019s have some traffic jams.</p>,\n",
       " <p>We want low oil prices.\\xa0 And Saudi Arabia has really done a good job in that respect.\\xa0 They pumped out a lot more oil than was going to be pumped out, when I called them about four weeks ago.\\xa0 And if you look at oil four weeks ago, it was at 82, 83, and was going up to a 100 a barrel.\\xa0 That would have doubled your prices and even tripled your prices at the car, for gasoline.\\xa0 And instead, you have very low gas prices all over the country.\\xa0 That\\u2019s because of what I did, and Saudi Arabia helped us.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But very importantly, they\\u2019re investing billions of dollars.\\xa0 They\\u2019re buying their equipment from us.\\xa0 And remember this: They don\\u2019t have to buy it from us.\\xa0 They can buy it from Russia and they can buy it from China.\\xa0 They make very good equipment.\\xa0 They don\\u2019t make as good equipment as we make; nobody does.\\xa0 Nobody even close.\\xa0 But they make very good equipment.</p>,\n",
       " <p>So they can spend their money in Russia and China and other places, and that is not acceptable.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But the CIA, Mr. President, concluded with confidence that MBS was responsible.</p>,\n",

       " <p>But they\\u2019re vehemently denying it.\\xa0 And we have hundreds of thousands of jobs.\\xa0 Do people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs?\\xa0 And frankly, if we went by this standard, we wouldn\\u2019t be able to have anybody as an ally.\\xa0 Because look at what happens all over the world.\\xa0 But then you can also take a look at Iran, take a look at Syria, where, you know, millions of people have been just slaughtered horribly, horribly.\\xa0 You take a look at what\\u2019s going on in Iran and the vicious \\u2014 the vicious situation that\\u2019s taking place there, and the number of people that are being killed and slaughtered.\\xa0 You take a look all over the world.\\xa0 We\\u2019re not going to be able to deal with \\u2014 let\\u2019s not deal with anybody.</p>,\n",

       " <p>We have a very strong ally in Saudi Arabia.\\xa0 We have an ally that said they did not commit, at the top level \\u2014 the Crown Prince, the King \\u2014 they did not commit this atrocity.\\xa0 And it\\u2019s an atrocity.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a terrible thing.\\xa0 I dislike it more than you do.\\xa0 But the fact is, they\\u2019ve been a very strong ally.\\xa0 They create tremendous wealth.\\xa0 They create, really, a tremendous number of jobs in their purchases.\\xa0 And very importantly, they keep the oil price down.\\xa0 If you want to see a global depression, all you have to do is lift the oil price $50 a barrel, which could happen very quickly, once we lose that relationship.</p>,\n",

       " <p>I really think the people of Afghanistan also \\u2014 and they are good fighters, and they fought for a long time; they fought for a lot longer than we fought.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve been fighting for many, many, many decades.\\xa0 But I think they\\u2019re tired of fighting.\\xa0 And we\\u2019ll see what happens.\\xa0 But we are talking about peace, and we\\u2019ll see if that happens.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Negotiations with?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 We have negotiations going on.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t know that they\\u2019re going to be successful.\\xa0 Maybe they\\u2019re not; probably they\\u2019re not.\\xa0 Who knows?\\xa0 They might be, they might not be.\\xa0 You know my attitude in all of that stuff, whether it\\u2019s North Korea or anybody else.\\xa0 Maybe they are going to be successful, and maybe they\\u2019re not going to be.\\xa0 But we have negotiations going on right now in Afghanistan, okay?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Mr. President, what is your response to people who say that a phone call wasn\\u2019t enough for the troops today?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well nobody has done more for the military than I have.\\xa0 I took the budget from very little to $700 billion and then $716 billion.\\xa0 And I\\u2019m now going over to the Coast Guard, where I did last year and I will probably a lot.\\xa0 But we\\u2019re going over to the Coast Guard.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And just, I really believe nobody \\u2014 in fact, a number of generals were on television over the weekend, and just unrelated, but they all mentioned the fact that nobody has done, as a President, for the military, in a long time what I\\u2019ve done.\\xa0 Because I\\u2019ve taken spending, where you had a depleted military, and it wasn\\u2019t being fixed and it was a mess, and it, frankly, put us in danger, and I was able to get Congress to give us $700 billion and now $716 billion for our military.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And I\\u2019ve also done more for the vets than anybody has ever done.\\xa0 I got Choice approved.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve been trying to get Choice for 40 years \\u2014 more than 40 years; they couldn\\u2019t get it \\u2014 where a vet can go directly to a doctor now instead of waiting on line for two months and two weeks and three weeks, and amounts of time that are unthinkable to anybody, including yourselves.</p>,\n",

       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If they have to, they\\u2019re going to use lethal force.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve given the okay.</p>,\n",

       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, if they have to.\\xa0 I hope they don\\u2019t have to.\\xa0 But, you know, you\\u2019re dealing with a minimum of 500 serious criminals.\\xa0 So I\\u2019m going to let the military be taken advantage of.\\xa0 I have no choice.\\xa0 Do I want that to happen?\\xa0 Absolutely not.\\xa0 But you\\u2019re dealing with rough people.</p>,\n",
       " <p>You ask the people in Tijuana, Mexico \\u2014 they opened with wide arms, just, \\u201cCome in, come in.\\xa0 Let me help you.\\xa0 Let us take care of you.\\u201d\\xa0 And within two days, now they\\u2019re going crazy to get them out.\\xa0 They want them out.\\xa0 Because things are happening.\\xa0 Bad, bad things are happening in Tijuana.\\xa0 And again, it\\u2019s not in this country, because we\\u2019ve closed it up.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I actually \\u2014 two days ago, we closed the border.\\xa0 We actually just closed it.\\xa0 We\\u2019re saying, nobody is coming in, because it was out of control.\\xa0 But you take a look at Tijuana, Mexico, and you see what\\u2019s happening there \\u2014 it\\u2019s really a bad situation.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What do you mean you closed the border and nobody is coming in?\\xa0 What do you mean by that, sir?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 If we find that it\\u2019s uncontrollable, Josh; if we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control, or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 You mean the entire border, or (inaudible) country?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 The whole border.\\xa0 I mean the whole border.\\xa0 And Mexico will not be able to sell their cars into the United States, where they make so many cars at great benefit to them \\u2013not at great benefit to us, by the way.\\xa0 But at least now we a good, new trade deal with Mexico and with Canada.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But we will close the border.\\xa0 And that means that Mexico is not going to be able to sell their cars into the United States until it\\u2019s open.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But we\\u2019re going to either have a border or we\\u2019re not.\\xa0 And when they lose control of the border, on the Mexico side, we just close the border.\\xa0 And we have a very powerful border.\\xa0 We built a very strong border in a very short period of time.\\xa0 And the military has been fantastic, the job they\\u2019ve done.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And, by the way, Border Patrol and ICE, all of the law enforcement we have involved \\u2014 and we have local law enforcement too \\u2014 they have done an incredible job.\\xa0 And they\\u2019ve wanted this for years.\\xa0 You know, I\\u2019m the first President that\\u2019s done it to this extent, but they\\u2019ve wanted this for years.</p>,\n",
       " <p>And some of the Presidents, I guess they didn\\u2019t care, or they wanted open borders.\\xa0 I don\\u2019t think they wanted open borders.\\xa0 Because most of them, if you go back to 2006, they all approved, essentially, a wall \\u2014 a very powerful fence \\u2014 which is pretty much the same thing.\\xa0 But in 2006, if you look \\u2014 Obama, you look at Hillary Clinton, you look at Schumer, all of the people that are standing up protesting \\u2014 they think it\\u2019s good for them politically.\\xa0 See, I think it\\u2019s very bad for them politically.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I think the fact that they\\u2019re weak on the border is very, very bad for them politically.\\xa0 But, you know, I\\u2019ve only been a politician for three years, so maybe they know better than me.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Is there going to be a government shutdown over this wall, in December?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Could happen, yeah.\\xa0 Over border security.\\xa0 The wall is just a part of border security \\u2014 a very important part.\\xa0 Probably the most important part.\\xa0 But could there be a shutdown?\\xa0 There certainly could.\\xa0 And it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Do you think Secretary Nielsen is doing a good enough job in securing the border?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, she\\u2019s in there trying, I\\u2019ll tell you.\\xa0 It\\u2019s a tough job.\\xa0 I mean, yesterday she gets a ruling that things that we were doing \\u2014 a judge that knows nothing about it \\u2014 decided to take law enforcement into his own hands, and he gives a ridiculous ruling.\\xa0 So we\\u2019ll appeal it.\\xa0 But it makes the job harder.\\xa0 We\\u2019re still doing the job perfectly.\\xa0 But it makes the job harder, and it makes the job more dangerous.\\xa0 Because a judge made a ruling that was shocking.\\xa0 Okay?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Just to be clear, going back to the idea of shutting down the border, what would it take for you reach that step and want to do that?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, I\\u2019ve already shut it down.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve already shut it down, for short periods.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are you talking about that one border port that closed?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 No, no.\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 I\\u2019ve already shut down parts of the border, because it was out of control, with the rioting on the other side, in Mexico.\\xa0 And I just said shut it down.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What does that look like in practice?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 What?</p>,\n",
       " <p>Q\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What does that look like in practice, to shut down the border?</p>,\n",
       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 You see it.\\xa0 I mean, it took place two days ago.</p>,\n",

       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah.\\xa0 They call me up and I sign an order.</p>,\n",

       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Oh, you don\\u2019t need it.\\xa0 Don\\u2019t worry.\\xa0 It\\u2019s not that big a deal, but maybe to some people it is.</p>,\n",
       " <p>What we want to do is we want to have a strong border.\\xa0 We want to have people come into our country.\\xa0 I want to have a lot of people come in.\\xa0 We need them.\\xa0 But they have to come in through merit, and they have to come in legally.\\xa0 They have to come in legally.</p>,\n",
       " <p>You know, we have a lot of people \\u2014 millions of people \\u2014 that have been waiting on line for years to become citizens of our country.\\xa0 Great people.\\xa0 They went through a whole process.\\xa0 And then these people come in and they think they\\u2019re just going to walk in and \\u2014 it\\u2019s a very unfair thing to all of the people that have been waiting on line, in some cases for many years.\\xa0 They\\u2019ve done it right, but they don\\u2019t think they\\u2019ve done it right, because they said, \\u201cWell, how can we do it right, and we go through this very complicated legal process,\\u201d and they have lawyers and everything else, and then you have people rushing through the border, and they\\u2019re supposed to stay?\\xa0 It\\u2019s not happening with me.\\xa0 We\\u2019ve been very tough on the border.</p>,\n",
       " <p>I mean, the problem that we have is that I\\u2019ve created, and helped create, a country that\\u2019s doing better than it\\u2019s ever done economically.\\xa0 So a lot of people are coming up here, because their countries are not doing well.\\xa0 And perhaps for a reason.\\xa0 But whatever that reason is, their countries are not doing well.</p>,\n",

       " <p>And, you know, it\\u2019s not a question of preparing.\\xa0 I think I\\u2019ve prepared for this meeting \\u2014 I had a meeting literally right in that corner with President Xi.\\xa0 We have a great relationship.\\xa0 I like him a lot.\\xa0 I think he likes me.\\xa0 Probably likes me less now than he did before we did what we\\u2019re doing.</p>,\n",

       " <p>So \\u2014 and that\\u2019s what I want \\u2014 I want to see.\\xa0 There\\u2019s always a lot of change.\\xa0 Yeah, I\\u2019ll probably be changing a couple, maybe a few, but very little.\\xa0 Overall, we\\u2019re very happy.</p>,\n",

       " <p>THE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Yeah, I have, actually.\\xa0 And very innocent, short period of time.\\xa0 Very early on.\\xa0 There was no deletion of emails, like the 33,000, plus probably another 100,000 that Hillary Clinton did after she got a subpoena.\\xa0 There was no bleached bit.\\xa0 There was no anything.\\xa0 Just innocent emails.\\xa0 There were not classified emails.\\xa0 A much different deal.\\xa0 That\\u2019s another fake-news story.\\xa0 And she did transition out.\\xa0 She was a private person, and then ultimately she transitioned out from private to government.\\xa0 And I believe all of her records are in the Historical Society, the historical records.\\xa0 Much different than the other situation that I\\u2019ve talked about for a long time.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But she transitioned out, but everything is in historical records.<br/>\\nI\\u2019ll see you over at the Coast Guard.\\xa0 I\\u2019m going over to say hello to the Coast Guard right now, which I look forward.\\xa0 And I\\u2019ll see \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re going, but if you are, I\\u2019ll see you there.</p>,\n",
